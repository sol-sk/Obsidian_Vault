### Crossed and Nested Factorial Designs
![[Screen Shot 2023-10-20 at 11.47.06 AM.png]]
Effect of factor depends on level of other factor: 
In this example, there are *two* simple main effects
The effect of game violence on aggression is different depending on if the participant is a man or a woman:
> Moderator variable = **gender**

Fully crossed designs: researchers study all possible conditions

> All possible combinations of condition

Nested factorial designs: one IV is nested within the other IV, preventing full crossing
(we just need to know difference between nested and fully crossed, don't need to analyze different)

### Ethics
Hypothesis: being exposed to biological theories of crime leads to leniency in judging perpetrators 
Operational definition: how long a sentence would you give?
#### Why go through the ethics review process?
> Take perspective of trusting participant: what does a trusting participant not expect to encounter?
> Principles are consistently applied

#### Ethical principles of TCPS 
> Respect for persons
> Concern for welfare
> Justice

##### Concern for Welfare
- Risk benefit analysis: ethical review of topic and method
	- Physical risk
	- Psychological/emotional 
	- Social
	- Privacy 
- Is the participants experience far different and riskier from everyday experiences?
- Exemptions: 
	- Evaluations: program evaluation, evaluating a teaching method (within reason)
	- Studies that do not involve interaction with participants (archival research)

##### Respect for persons
- Consent form should be accurate 
- Deception: sins of commission: lying/misleading, sins of omission 
- Debriefing: explain purposes of research, apologize, explain reason for lying
