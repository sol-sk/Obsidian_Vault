### Lecture
#### Review
**The hard problem of consciousness:** No theory which uses purely third-personal, objective terms can explain what is essentially first-personal and subjective

#### Responses to the hard problem
**Non-physicalist responses:** 
	Accept the explanatory gap between physical and phenomenal properties and infer a metaphysical gap. Consciousness is fundamentally nonphysical
**Physicalist rejoinders:** 
	i) reject the putative explanatory gap
	ii) accept the explanatory gap but deny the metaphysical gap. 

These two challenges have opened the door to some surprising scientific theories of phenom. consc.
- Integrated information (Φ) theories (Tononi, Koch)
- 'Axioms' (Intrinsicality, Information, Integration, Exclusion, Composition), and corresponding physical postulates
	- Has specific mathematical and physical postulates about where consciousness is
	- "Back of the head" theory
- Implies that all intrinsic physical systems possess some degree of consciousness (panpsychism)
- May have even more radical implications about which entities exist; only those with maximal Φ, with all parts of the system existing only in a relative sense (namely, as objects for some conscious subject)
	- Idealism?
