### Lecture
#### Review
**Global workspace theory**
- Conscious states are those that are globally broadcast throughout the system
- Role: to coordinate modules/integrate contents
- (front of the head theory)
**Higher order theories** 
- Conscious states are those that are objects of meta representation
	Why?
	- Cognitive restructuring: taking a "step back" and try out alternative perspectives

#### Synthesizing GWT and HOT
**Content that gains entry to the global workspace becomes objects of meta-representation**
- States can orchestrate activity within the broader cognitive system while remaining a potential site of metacognitive intervention

#### Key assumptions made by GWS and HOT theorists
- Central task for theory of consciousness is to abstractly explain what consciousness is and show how that abstraction could be realized architecturally and physically (Marr)
- In formulating an abstract description of what consciousness is/does, theorists should take as their primary evidence subject's verbal reports about their conscious states 
- Consciousness is a higher cognitive phenomenon

**But! These are not all universally accepted**

##### Creature consciousness
- Consciousness is a property of a creature/organism/person
##### State consciousness
- Consciousness is a property of a mental state
Types of state consciousness:
- self-consciousness: being conscious of a mental state as such
- access consciousness: a mental state available for the global control of action (reasoning, intentional action)
- phenomenal consciousness: a mental state that there is something it is like for the subject to be in; the phenomenal character of this state is how it 'feels' or 'what it is like' ('POV:')

**HO theories seem to explain self-consciousness, GWS explains access consciousness, HO-GWS explains both** 

But what about *phenomenal consciousness?*
(see also: [[PHIL351 L15 Worries for tracking#Phenomenal intentionality]])
#### Phenomenal overflow
When the bandwidth of phenomenal consciousness exeeds/outstrips the bandwidth of cognitive access. 
Similarly, if phenomenal consciousness goes beyond the content of self-awareness

**Block's 'methodological challenge'**
- How do you scientifically investigate whether phenomenal consciousness overflows access consciousness when out methods for detecting consciousness depend on access consciousness?
GWS's challenge: how to justify restriction of phenomenal consciousness to access conscious without begging the question (eg. relying on verbal reports)

Block's moral: GWS theories fail because they link phenom. consc. with central cogntition
- We perceive a whole stim but can only consciously access part of it

HO's challenge? 
- Immersion and flow state: phenom. consc. experiences which occur without self-consciousness

**Phenomenal conscious seems fundamentally different from other theories of consciousness**
- We understand it in *first person terms*: all other theories thus far (and scientific theories in general) are expressed in *third person*
