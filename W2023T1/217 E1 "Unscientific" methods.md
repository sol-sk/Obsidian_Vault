Experience
Folk wisdom/common sense
Authority
Intuition
	Note: Eurocentric definition, [[Indigenous ways of knowing]] will come up later in the course

#### Intuition
> Unquestioning acceptance of own judgement

Pros: 
	more quickly and easily accessible knowledge
	reflect values which are important to us
Cons: 
	Difficult to analyze and critique
	Subject to prejudice and misconception


#### Authority 
> Knowledge based on information from "credible other"
> 	e.g. celebrity endorsements

Pros: 
	We don't need to seek out knowledge independently
	Many people of authority have legitimate credentials to be considered 'authority'
Cons:
	Authorities may be wrong, or use unscientific ways of knowing
	'Authority' may be due to perceived cues of credibility (attractiveness, popularity)- *halo effect*
		Halo effect present even in infants and toddlers

#### Common Sense/Folk Wisdom
> Appealing to what one expects everyone else to know 
> 	Idiomatic (idioms= truth statements because everyone says them)

Pros: 
	There is an explanation/saying for almost everything
	Short, mutually understood way of communicating a more complicated idea
Cons:
	Often contradictory and therefore meaningless
	Cannot be refuted or falsified

#### Experience
> Relying on personal experience to make decisions

Pros: 
	May be representative of the common experience
	Vivid examples are easy to remember
Cons:
	May not be representative/may contradict common experience
	Cannot account for alternative explanations
