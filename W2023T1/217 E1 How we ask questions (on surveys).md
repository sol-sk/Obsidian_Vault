##### How we ask questions (on surveys)
Open ended
	No restrictions, participants can say whatever they like

 Closed ended 
	Rating scales
		Anchors/labels at each end of numerical scale (numbers also referred to as "alternatives")
		Strongly disagree -> Strongly agree 1-5 : **Likert Scale**
			Any variation: **Likert-type scale**
		Considerations: how many numbers/alternatives do you provide? how many anchors/labels do you provide? what do you give as anchors?
	Semantic differential scale
		Word on one end, antonym on other end:
	Non-verbal scale 
		Pain picture chart
	Forced choice 
		Options restricted to a few specific choices (a la buzzfeed quiz)
	**Keep in mind:**
		Double-barreled questions (do you think x AND y?)
		Leading/loaded questions
		Negative wording
		Yea-saying/nay-saying
			Someone choosing only yes or only no: can catch with contradicting questions
		Fence-sitting
			Responder choosing only neutrality: get rid of neutral alternative
