### Core principles
##### Concern for welfare
- Risk-benefit 
- Physical harm, psychological stress
- Deception
- Privacy
- Debriefing following study addresses stresses
##### Respect for persons
- Informed consent
	- Purpose, procedures/time, risks and benefits, compensation, confidentiality, permission to withdraw, contact information
- Autonomy
- Secondary use of data
- Withholding information: acceptable if it is unlikely to interfere with decision to participate
- Deception: ensure more realistic behavior, but has decreased since 80s
	- Decrease due to: memory and cognitive research more popular, more awareness of ethical issues, ethics committees, elaborate setups are difficult to achieve
- Alternatives to deception: role playing, simulation, and honest experiments
**Importance of debriefing**
- Education, comforting, explain purpose + expected results
##### Justice
Equitable involvement
Fairness in receiving benefits of research


### Monitoring ethical standards
Research ethics board (REB)
Exempt research: 
- only uses publicly available information that is legally accessible; 
- only involves observing people in public places without any intervention or interaction by the researcher, and no individuals can be identified when presenting the results; 
- uses data that have already been collected and are completely anonymous


##### Greater than minimal risk research
Questionnaires and interviews involving illegal drug use, vulnerable populations, other sensitive subjects
Air on side of caution: conservative approach categorizes subjects as greater than minimal risk even if it's on the fence
Greater than minimal risk research requires an an application to institutional REB

### Ethics and animal research
Animal research has been declining over time, less than 10% since the 80s
Three Rs: Replacement, reduction, refinement
### Scientific misconduct and publication ethics
**Fraud:**
- fabricating data
- altering data to fit hypothesis
Plagiarism
