### Lecture
Functional indeterminacy problem: What can the frog distinguish visually? 
Explanation pf proper function framed in terms of selection history generate some counterintuitive results 
	→ "Swampman" who just emerges spontaneously can think, but without **history**, they cannot, according to theory of proper function
- Representation is a stand-in for the represented (tracking which is causally distal)
- Representation tracks objects, implying a self-world distinction

#### Phenomenal intentionality
- anchors our concept of intentionality in first-person reflection/introspection on one's conscious states
- the intentional content of a mental state **is given by a mental state's subjective or phenomenal character**
- often strongly 'internalist' about mental content (ie. the representational content of a mental state is 'narrow', not constitutively dependent on features of the individual's environment)
- Morals for the Chinese room argument?

##### Phenomenal intentionality vs causal theorists
Causal theorists (tracking) would argue w/ phenom. about the order of explanation between content and consciousness
- Consciousness-first theorists: the representational properties of a mental state are intrinsically properties of the mental state → consciousness explains content/aboutness (Searle)
- Content-first theorists: the phenomenal properties of a mantal state are just representational properties of a mental state that satisfy further causal conditions → content explains consciousness

#### Cappelen & Denver; practicality of philosophy of ANNs mental content 
What's the point of this philosophizing around mental content? They respond: 
1. If ANNs are to have practical application, then we must be able to interpret their outputs
2. To interpret ANN's outputs, we must have a theory of content for ANNs
3. We have no theory of content for ANNs
4. So, we can't interpret an ANN's outputs
5. So, ANNs have no practical application to society

**Example**
Lucie has applied for a mortgage and given the bank permission to access various items of personal information about her. Within minutes of completing an application, she is given a low credit score of 550 and is denied a mortgage. Lucie’s credit score was calculated by SmartCredit (an ANN).

> Lucie’s First Question: What does the output ‘550’ that has been assigned to me mean?  
> 
> Bank: it’s a credit score representing her creditworthiness.  
> 
> Lucie’s Second Question: Why is the ‘550’ that the computer displays on the screen an assessment of my credit-worthiness? What makes it mean that?  
> 
> Bank: <detailed explanation of how SmartCredit works, how it was trained, and the scoring method used to assess SmartCredit’s performance>
> 
> Lucie’s Third Question: How is the final meaningful state of SmartCredit (the output ‘550’, meaning that Lucie’s credit score is 550) the result of other meaningful considerations that SmartCredit is taking into account?  
> 
> Bank: ...
