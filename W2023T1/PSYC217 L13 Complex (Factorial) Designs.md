[[PSYC217 L12 Quasi-Experimental Designs cont. and Complex Study designs#Factorial Design Example doggy design]]
**Result is an example of interaction**
- The effect of command on proportion of dogs sitting is **different** *depending* on whether food is present or not
- When effect of the first IV on the DV changes *depending on* the level of the second IV
	- Second IV = "moderator" or "moderator variable"
- Benefits: allows us to find interactions, more closely mimics real world situations

Presence of food = **moderator**

### Interpreting interaction graphs
- Understand psych phenomena more comprehensively, we need to understand interactions
- Learning to visualize data can be tough at first, but make interpreting data much easier
- Easier to read journal articles

#### Line graphs: 
- Are lines parallel? 
No: indicates interaction
- Are the midpoints of the lines different? (*marginal mean*)
No: indicates interaction
- Are each level of the IV the same? 
Aka, do different levels of IV lead to different levels of DV

**The effect of presence of food is...**
> Greater when someone says "sit"

Main effects are *qualified* by an interaction between two independent variables: we can't say that giving treats to dogs will always lead to more dogs sitting because it is qualified by the other factor (giving the command to sit)
##### Simple main effects
> Simple main effects = effect of one IV on the DV within a single level of the second IV

Example: different between treat and no treat in the "no sit" group

**Decide on one way to split the data**

**==11.4 in textbook==**

#### IV x PV
Example: violent video game
Factor 1: game violence
Factor 2: gender
DV = aggression
