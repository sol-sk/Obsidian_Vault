**Comparing participant to themself**
#### Concurrent-measures design
Participants exposed to both conditions at almost same time (rapid fire), asked after both
Associated with single attitudinal or behavioral preference as DV

Example:
	Participants play both nonviolent and violent game and get asked:
		Which was more fun? Which would you recommend to a child? Which made you feel more aggressive?

**Problems:**
	Severe restriction of research questions and DVs
	Strong demand characteristics

**Advantages:**
	Simple and quick to run, can avoid carryover effects
#### Repeated-measures design
Participants are exposed to all experimental conditions, **DV is measured after each exposure**

**Problems:**
	Also demand characteristics
	Carryover/order effects: 
		Fatigue effects
		Contrast effects
		Practice effects

**Advantages:**
	Serve as own control 
	Require fewer participants

Carryover/order effects:
> Participants response is affected by other conditions;
> When the effects of one condition carry over into the next condition

Fatigue effects:
> Makes participant more tired/bored

Practice effects:
> Improving because of first condition: practice

Contrast effects:
> Harsher/more extreme condition makes other condition seem less intense

**Prevention: Counterbalance**
Switches up order of conditions

**Within subjects designs can detect error better with fewer participants**
