### 3 Basic approaches to understand brain 
##### Induce loss of function
- Offers a glimpse into how the region acts normally
##### Induce gain of function
- "Turning up" a system has similar effects; see more of system specific behavior
- However: more 
##### Monitor behavior and brain activity simultaneously
- Only correlated: cannot causally define 

**Combination of these methods can be better**

Different methods capture milliseconds; some hours â€“both useful for their respective use cases
#### **Recording voltage**: Intra + extracellular
- "gold standard"
##### Single-cell recording: 
**Intracellular**: can tell when you enter cell because voltage goes to negative. Incredibly difficult due to size of cell, and awake animals can knock it out of place. Resting = negative, *action potential = positive*

**Extracellular**: electrode vs ground. needle needs to be in brain but not in cell. Resting potential = positive, *action potential = negative*

**Single electrode:** cannot differentiate *number of neurons firing*

**Tetrode (4 electrodes):** can better differentiate because you can see the difference in signal between electrodes. Can record from many neurons at once

Raster plot: y axis shows all trials stacked up, synchronized in time, to see pattern of activity
- Shows when one neuron fires response to stimulus or activity

Single neuron activity can be very noisy, as it just continuously fires
Multiple neuron shows more information

**Population coding/Distributed representation**
- Behaviors, constructs, ideas etc. require action of *many neurons*

**Parallel processing**: single signal will disperse throughout brain for multiple parts of brain to process

#### Halle Berry neuron
**Epilepsy studies**
- Sometimes epileptic/dysfunctional area gets fully removed surgically 
	Electrode recordings not commonly done without good reason: so, epileptic patients who need electrode recording for treatment get used for other unrelated studies
- Area is pinpointed by electrode placement (usually in temporal lobe)
	- Study done showing people diff pictures/stimuli and look for patterns: found that there is a single neuron which only fires when it sees Halle Berry (face *or name*)
		- Didn't fire for anything else! 

**Not just parallel processing! Some cells have very specific purposes: "concept cells"**
- Typically in or around hippocampus

Limitations to recording brain electrical activity: 
Need to insert more electrodes but rats have small brains AND they don't like it!!
- Starting to use new probes that get more data from more neurons
Making sense of tremendous amounts of data!
- 300,000 neurons; data incredibly difficult to parse, large issue in neuroscience 
#### Electroencephalography (EEG)
Electrodes placed on scalp with contact gel
Can only record voltages from cortex, extremely faint and noisy
Needs amplifier for better signal 

Good for epilepsy and sleep because both concern levels of activity (rather than specific regions)

**EEG waves**
Show population synchrony
Awake or excited: high frequency, low amplitude 
- Not synchronized = low amplitude
Deep sleep: low frequency, high amplitude 
- All neurons fire at the same time
Alpha - 8-12 
	Wakeful
Beta 
Gamma
	Highest frequency: contents of consciousness
	Highest amplitude recorded from monks meditating!
		Novices trained by monks to meditate: as they get better at meditating; trying to manifest compassion, their gamma levels got *higher*
		Shows that meditation is actually full of brain activity
			Rhythm possibly mediated by fast-spiking, GABAergic interneurons 
Delta
	Sleep
Theta
	Medial temp lobe

**Sleep recording methods:**
**EMG: Voltage on muscles**
muscle tone decreases as people fall asleep 
**EOG: eye movement**
"rapid eye movement"


EEG is more reflective of PSPs than APs: doesn't tell you how many APs are firing
	Due to neuron orientation: output layer faces inward, not toward scalp
	Tells you state but not content 

#### Event-related potentials (ERP)
Like raster plot: averaging trials of EEG
Helps show signal emerging through noise
Spikes in activity are named in chronological order: spike 1 = P1, etc. 

##### Transcranial magnetic stimulation
Noninvasive, induces loss (or sometimes gain) of function 
Uses magnetic field to alter electrical activity in cortex
