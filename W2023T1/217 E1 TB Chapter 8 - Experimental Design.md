## TB Learning Objectives - Experimental design
1. LO1 Describe how confounding variables affect the internal validity of an experiment. 
2. LO2 List and explain three major steps toward planning a basic experiment. 
3. LO3 Describe the pretest-posttest design, including the advantages and disadvantages of using a pretest. 
4. LO4 Describe the matched-pairs design, including reasons to use this design. 
5. LO5 Contrast a between-subjects design with a within-subjects design, including advantages and disadvantages of each.

### between-subjects design 
>  (also known as an independent groups design)
>  different people experience the levels of the independent variable. In this kind of experiment, the experimental and control groups are distributed between different people. 

##### selection differences 
> The people selected to be in the experimental condition should not differ in any systematic way from those selected for the control condition

##### pretest-posttest design 
> **pretest:** used to measure levels of the key dependent variable: ensure that participants in both conditions had equal levels of the construct pre-IV manip.
> makes it possible for researchers to be absolutely sure that the groups were equivalent at the beginning of the experiment

**Why pretest?** 
- (1) to counter problems associated with a small sample size, 
- (2) to select appropriate participants, and 
- (3) when participants might drop out of the study. 
#####  matched pairs design
> "yoked design"
> most likely to be used when it is not possible to collect a large sample, making simple random assignment less likely to be successful in creating equivalent groups
> useful when individual differences are expected to have a large influence on the dependent variable
> can be costly and time-consuming
### within-subjects design 
>  (also known as a repeated measures design)
>  all the same people experience all levels of the independent variable. For a within-subjects design, the experimental and control conditions are equally distributed within all participants. 

##### pros of within-subj 
> fewer research participants are needed because everyone participates in all conditions
> extremely sensitive, able to detect small differences between conditions

##### cons of within-subj
> order effects

#### order effects
> pose a threat to the *internal validity* of a study
> *How to compensate*: counterbalancing & ensuring that the time between conditions is long enough to minimize the influence of the first condition on the second

##### practice effect
> when performance improves because of repeated practice with a task

##### fatigue effect 
> when performance worsens as participants become tired, bored, or distracted

##### contrast effect 
> when the response to the second condition in the experiment is altered because experiences of the first highlight how they are different

##### counterbalancing
> all possible orders of presentation for the conditions are included in the experimen

##### Latin square
> limited set of all possible orders which ensures: each condition appears in each position in the order and each condition appears directly before and directly after each other condition exactly once

**Example: 4 conditions (hours of sleep study)**
1. 0, 4, 8, 6
2. 4, 6, 0, 8
3. 6, 8, 4, 0 
4. 8, 0, 6, 4

#### Choosing between Between- and within-subjects design
**Consider:** 
- Number of subjects necessary/available
- Sensitivity of DV
- Order effects
- Demand characteristics: getting to see all conditions
- Permanent changes
- *External validity*
