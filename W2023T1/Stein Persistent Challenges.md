STEIN, SHARON. “The Persistent Challenges of Addressing Epistemic Dominance in Higher

> “In particular, when we are still seeking fulfillment of the imaginary’s promises, there is a risk of appropriating difference from outside and then recuperating it back into existing frameworks, betraying and instrumentalizing its gifts. This approach may challenge the content but not the framing of the imaginary.” (44)

> “That is, if epistemic dominance is not (only) caused by a lack of knowledge but rather (or also) by the very imperative to accumulate knowledge and police the categories of meaning by which existence is organized, then a solely additive approach that “celebrates” difference but ultimately operates within the same framework may fail to adequately address the underlying problem (Bhambra 2013).” (29)
