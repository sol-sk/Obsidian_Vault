### Pre class reading
Cain, Chapter 2, §§1-3
pp. 39-59 [[The Philosophy of Cognitive Science (Cain, Mark J) (Z-Library).pdf]]

Haugeland (**formalist's motto**): "if you take care of the syntax, the semantics will take care of itself."
	ie if your machine follows correct logical rules, the truth value of the meaning of the output will match the truth value of the input meaning 
Classical computationalism 

## Lecture
### Review: outline of the computational theory of mind 
See: formalist's motto
"Dual life" of a symbol: one syntactic and effective, the other semantic and non-effective
	Relevant semantic property of formal logic? **Truth: syntactic properties organized around truth preservation**
Smith's representational mandate: P1-4 [[PHIL351 L5 - Cantwell-Smith GOFAI (first wave AI)#Representational mandate]]
	Use of symbols (representations) is what defines computational theory of mind

Computer = Interpretable, automated, formal system
### Milestones of the classical paradigm in cognitive science
#### Chomsky: Computational Linguistics
##### *Syntactic Structures* (1957)
> What explains the syntactic structures which occur in natural language? 

Inspired by Turing: applies computational principles to language
**"Transformational grammar"** and distinction between **surface** and **deep** sentence structures
	Surface: what is used in speech or language
	Deep: psychological representation
	*Algorithms are used to mediate these representations*
##### Poverty of the stimulus: Innate universal grammar
> Nativist thesis: common to all human biology, there is a universal grammar 
> *Domain specific* form of knowledge (about language itself)

Empiricism argued that domain general capacities allowed for language acquisition: Chomsky argues that there is not enough stimulus/exposure for infants to acquire as many aspects of language/grammar as they do

**Duhem-Quine thesis**: scientific theories are systematically underdetermined by empirical data. 
	[[PHIL351 L3 Recognizing intelligence when we see it (pt.2)#Core commitments of cognitive science as defined by Cain]]
	Can be used to draw skeptical conclusions (anti-realist conclusion: we can never truly justify)
	Or: "somehow, we make do." We infer the best explanation on basis of data
		Choose theories based on parsimony, conservatism, etc. 
Key problems for empiricist solutions: 
	i) infants converge on the right solution despite general considerations of simplicity, etc. 
		So: are they just smarter than we thought? likely not, because:
	ii) infants aren't as sophisticated in other domains
		**So: there *must* be innate, language specific knowledge in order to make language acquisition computationally tractable**
##### Cartesian linguistics?
>While he borrows heavily from Turing, Chomsky doesn't believe in a purely mechanistic theory of cognition


*Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought* (Chomsky, book) 
	Chomsky's theory of generative grammar as an *elaboration* of Descartes doctrine of *innate ideas* and the *inherent creativity* of human language

### Computational perception? 
> AI researchers surprised to learn that perception was a *nontrivial* task for a cognitive system 
> 	Cf. the broadening of 'cognition'

#### Marr's tri-level theory of vision
Computational level:
	What is the computation that has to be performed (the input output transformation)?
Algorithmic level:
	How are the computations computed? What are the representations of the input and output, and the algorithms for their transformation?
Implementation level: 
	How are the representations and algorithms physically realized or mechanically implemmented?
"Trying to understand perception by studying only neurons is like trying to understand bird flight by only studying feathers"
	We will get lost in the weeds if we start by studying the brain: we have to start at the abstract functional level 

e.g. Q: Why do animals need vision? What is its purpose? 
Marr's A: enables discrimination and recognition of objects, as well as their properties and relationships
	(This A will be challenged later)
	In order to make this mechanical, algorithmic, the visual system needs preexisting assumptions and biases; poverty of stim
