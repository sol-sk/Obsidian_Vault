#### Recruitment: Sampling techniques
Most use a form of non-probability sampling
##### Non-probability sampling: Convenience sampling 
- Recruit participants whenever and wherever possible 
- Not likely to be representative

##### Non-probability sampling: Purposive sampling 
- Targeting only people who fit a certain set of criteria 
- eg. mailing list to heavy + light smokers

##### Non-probability sampling: Snowball sampling 
- Asking participants to ask others to participate, helping researchers accumulate participants
- Good for recruiting less common phenomenon eg. synesthesia

#### Comparing non vs probability sampling
##### Non-probability sampling
Low generalizability because
- Not representative of population
- Self-selection: non-probability much worse than probability sampling
- eg. rate my prof: only people who comment have very strong feelings 

**College sophomore problem**
Most researchers are university professors → Most participants are university students
3 responses: 
- Does not invalidate prev results, just need more data
	- Failure to replicate; ideas are incomplete, not wrong
	- Why fail to replicate? how might non-college students differ? - **boundary conditions**
- A lot of research is on very basic processes
	- Vision, olfactory, systems are the same across all ppl (altho cultural psych shows this is not super true)
- College pops are very diverse 
**Solution** Collect data from more diverse groups and look for statistical interactions
#### Generalizability
Different levels of generalizability 
**Can we generalize from one lab to another?** 
- One experimental setting might have subtle but key differences: interaction effects between participants and experimenters (biosocial/psychosocial)
- Problematic when running study across diff labs
- *Solution*: Standardize interaction between experimenters and participants
**The "real world"**
- Studies that resemble the real world = high **ecological validity** (type of concerns abt generalizability) 
	- Mundane realism 
	- Experimental realism: realistic experience in artificial setting
- Soln: include more realistic designs within reason

**Generalizing between populations (eg. gender, cultural bckgd): experiment on diff populations and find interaction effects**
- WEIRD pops are only 15% of world

Example: In lab setting
Tell participants about genetic/env explanation for crime → ask if they think some perp would be guilty 
vs
Provide w realisitc case report, w explanation for crime → as if they think perp is guilty
