### Motivations for LOT
LOT has a finite set of atomic symbol-types (e.g. words), which have a set meaning
There are strict syntactic rules for how to concatenate one atomic symbol to another to form a complex expression
These rules are recursive
The meaning of a complex LOT expression is a systematic function of the semantic values of the constituent elements and their syntactic organization (**compositionality**)

Fodor argues that animals have beliefs and desires, using a language of thought

Chomskian themes throughout Fodor's Mentalese writing

Productivity: human thinkers have capacity to understand a large number of sentences without having encountered them before 
	LOT is *generative*
	*Systematicity*: if someone understands a complex expression, they will understand a diff complex expression which comprises the same constituents

Proponents argue LOT is unique bc it explains how thought can both cause and justify action
> A thought both causes and justifies a transition whenever the syntactic relations between the LOT sentences are structurally isomorphic to the rational relations between the propositional contents of the sentences

Exploiting such parallelism between syntactic and semantic structure (in the manner of a Turing machine,) LOT shows how everyday episodes of personal level reasoning can be fundamentally a mechanical process

We can translate the theoretical taxonomy of common-sense psych into the theoretical taxonomy of cognitive science
	Belief, desire, reasoning, planning, decision making, etc.
