### Measures of Variability
aka Measure of dispersion 
- Spread of distribution of scores
#### Measures:
- Range (max-min)
- Variance ($s^2$)
	- Sum of squared deviations (to prevent negative/positive deviations cancelling each other out ) around mean divided by N-1
	- Need it for later analyses
- Standard deviation ($s$ or SD)
	- Square root of variance
	- On average, the deviations of each score from the mean
	- Beyond 3 SD away from mean = **outlier**


#### Normal distribution (perfect bell curve)
> Mean = 50%, *is also median and mode*

2% of scores are -3 SD from mean
14% of scores are -2 SD from mean
34% of scores are within -1 SD from mean
And these # s are mirrored for +1 SD, +2, etc: 68% are within Â±1 SD

##### IQ scores are "normed"
68% of people are between 85 and 115, 95% between 70 and 130 
Each SD is 15 points 

### Descriptive statistics
Measures of central tendency 
- mean median mode
Measures of variability
Measures of relationships
- Correlation r and $r^2$
- Multiple regression
- Multiple correlation R and $R^2$
- Partial correlation

#### Walter Mischel (Marshmallow): Delay of Gratification
Variable 1: Ability to delay gratification at age 5
Variable 2: Academic competence (rated by parents..) at age 15
Pearson r = .39 (small correlation)
	$r^2$ = .15
$r^2$ = **Coefficient of determination**
- 0 = no shared variance
- 1 = complete overlap
