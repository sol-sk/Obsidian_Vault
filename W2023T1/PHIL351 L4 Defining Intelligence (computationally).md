### Defining intelligence
#### Goal-directedness
> The ability to work towards a reasonable goal
> 	Seen in many non-humans: how do we account for this? How do they go about goal-achieving? Are they flexible?

#### Transferability
> The ability to use the same skill or action across different *situations*
> 	Adaptability, with appropriate changes for effective transfer of ability

#### Manipulability, endogenous control
> Intelligent behavior must be a result of internal control by the agent, rather than situational variables
> 	Active rather than passive, top down vs bottom up, goal-directed vs stimulus driven

#### In summary
> An intelligent system is one that tends to arrive at the same goal state within a wide range of counterfactual scenarios of environmental variance
> 	Goal attainment is "robust" or "resilient"


#### What makes language use intelligent? 
> Conversation is a *goal directed activity*, subject to various *norms of appropriateness*, manifests *significant flexibility* and context sensitive *transferability*: with a highly *creative* result


### Turing Machines 
> Formalizing the notion of an algorithm or effective method: a kind of fool-proof recipe for achieving a certain result

##### Historical background for Turing machines
Mathematicians had become self-conscious about their reliance on intuitions about what is self-evidently or certain (e.g. about what should be treated as axiomatic)
	Attempts to derive Euclid's 5th postulate resulted in a new geometry
	Attempts to derive arithmetic from naive set theory resulted in paradox
	**Crises of confidence in certainty**
This leads to 'formalism' or 'Hilbert's program' in (meta)mathematics: 
	**Mathematics is *not* the intellectual intuition of eternal platonic truths, but a "formal system" of *meaningless symbol tokens* manipulable according to rules that are purely *stipulated* and *mechanical* (ie algorithmic)**
Turing machines are not concerned with the "meaning" of symbols within each cell: just their *physical properties*
