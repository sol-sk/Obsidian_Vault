### Conduction
Constant regeneration of action potential 

**Myelination = insulation, prevents action potential decay**
	-> Voltage gated sodium channels should have larger gaps between them to ensure fast transit (opening doors in a hallway example), by preventing decay these gaps can be larger without losing signal
	Passive transmission of signal is faster than active bc speed of electricity
	Losing myelination -> MS
	Larger axon also assists with preserving signal 

#### Axon terminal
- Ends in terminal boutons/buttons
- Voltage gated channels open up for **calcium**
- Inside of cell has incredibly low concentration of calc compared to outside
- Calcium signals to proteins inside cell–vesicles–which fuse with membrane and release neurotransmitters

#### Dendrite membrane
![[Screen Shot 2023-10-26 at 1.19.52 PM.png]]
Receptors (around half of them) on post-synaptic membrane are just another kind of channel, which open when they bind with a neurotransmitter
- ***Ligand-gated ion channels***
- **Ligand gated**: opens when a neurotransmitter bonds to it 
- When this gate opens, sodium flows in and *depolarizes* cell: **EPSP**
	- **Glutamate (any neurotransmitter) is excitatory because of the type of receptors it binds to**
- Chloride Cl-, which floats around cell can also affect cell voltage

PSPs occur on dendrite, APs occur on axon/terminal
Graded: spectrum, can be stronger or weaker
AM: amplitude modulated, stronger signals are conveyed by bigger EPSPs
FM: frequency modulated, stronger signals are conveyed by more APs per second
Rapid: APs are slower because they need to be regenerated, but don't decay 
Decremental: PSPs do decay

##### A virtual neuron (USE TO STUDY) 
1. Go to: https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/neuron and run the simulation 
2. Identify three proteins that we discussed 
3. Identify one protein we did not discuss—it is real, but not particularly physiologically relevant for our story of RMPs and APs 
4. Describe what’s happening at rest (i.e. during resting membrane potential), as regards ionic flow (it helps to zoom in) 
5. Describe the order of events when you stimulate the neuron (it helps to slow it down) 
6. Turn on the potential chart (bottom right corner). What do you see when you stimulate the neuron? Be specific about voltage changes. 
7. Turn on the “Show Concentrations” option (bottom right corner). What do the concentrations tell you at rest? How do those concentrations change when you stimulate the neuron? What do those cha

#### Neurotransmitter Learning objectives
1. Name and describe the two basic types of receptors. Why have both? 
2. Describe receptors by their locations. Describe the relationship between receptor location and its function. 
3. Name three types of neurotransmitter clean-up. 
4. Name the major groups of neurotransmitters, and some examples within each group. 
5. Describe the two primary types of drug action. 
6. Describe the roles of glutamate, GABA, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, endocannabinoids, adenosine, and the endogenous opioids. 
7. Describe some drugs that affect these systems, including their drug action. 
8. Is dopamine the pleasure molecule? Is serotonin the mood molecule? Is norepinephrine the memory molecule? Support your answers with evidence.
### Receptor types
![[Screen Shot 2023-10-26 at 3.20.40 PM.png]]

#### Ionotropic: 
- Ligand-gated ion channels
- Ions flow through when neurotransmitter binds to it
- Specific to one kind of ion: sodium, chlorine, etc. 
- Receptor closes as soon as receptor disconnects: **fast, transient effects**
#### Metabotropic:
- G-protein coupled receptors
- no hole/pore/channel: ions do not cross through
- covered with **G-proteins** bound to them inside the cell
- When signal occurs: g-proteins disconnect -> sends *intra-cellular* message
	- Can make cell more excitable/sensitive to signals by making receptors stay open longer, or come through membrane, or vice versa for less sensitive
	- *Signal cascade*: can reach nucleus and affect transcription
	- Type of signal depends on the type of g-protein
- Modulatory: slow, long lasting effect
	- Much more diffuse, affects system

#### Presynaptic: Auto and Heteroreceptors
![[Screen Shot 2023-10-26 at 3.32.47 PM.png]]
**Auto(re)ceptors**: 
- (typically) Metabotropic, sends signal to self
- *Inhibitory*: "negative feedback mechanism"
	- Prevents too much of signal
- Heteroceptor: bonds to *different* neurotransmitter
	- A third axon present at synapse which releases a diff neurotransmitter: this receives it
	- Metabotropic

### Neurotransmitter clean-up
- Diffusion: on the rare occasion that they even can float away 
- Enzymatic degradation 
- Re-uptake
	- Just recycle the neurotransmitter!
	- Transporter proteins on pre-synaptic side, very similar to a pump: constantly pump neurotransmitter back into cell 
	- Dopamine transmitters also re-uptake norepinephrine, serotonin
	- Vesicular transport gets them back into vesicles for reuse
	- **Astrocytes** also have transporters
- Drugs which affect re-uptake will often affect multiple neurotransmitters, as well as astroglia

### Drug types
> Affects **synapse function**: transporter blocker, re-uptake inhibitor, enzyme inhibitor, etc. 
- Agonist 
- Antagonist
Turning up or turning down the effects of a neurotransmitter system
