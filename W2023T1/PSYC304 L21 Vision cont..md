### Lecture
#### Retinal fields + Optic chiasm 
![[Screen Shot 2023-12-13 at 7.03.42 PM.png]]
Left eye doesnt go to right hemi: left visual field, that both eyes perceive (green tracts), goes to right hemi

**Nasal hemiretina**: part of hemiretina closer to nose
**Temporal hemiretina**: part of hemiretina closer to temples

Info coming from left visual field into left eye goes into the nasal hemiretina/right vis field → right eye also nasal hemiretina
- So: nasal hemiretina crosses optic chiasm
- Temporal *does not* cross optic chiasm
Cut left optic tract: removes info from *right side of world*
Cut left optic nerve: removes info from *left eye*
Cutting optic chiasm: removes info from *nasal hemiretinas*

The difference in how these damages affect vision allows us to track where tumors/damage may be by testing where/how vision is affected

#### Lateral geniculate nucleus
**6 layers**
Endpoint of axons from eyes
**Retinotopic map**: neurons which are responsible for adjacent parts of visual field will terminate next to each other: corresponding

**Parvocellular layers** 
- 4 layers
- Receive from cones primarily
- Fovea/cones → bipolar cells → P cells → parvocellular layers
- Center of vision is disproportionately processed by brain (prioritized)
- Parvo = small, cells are smaller than Magno layers
- P = perception (color, shapes)
**Magnocellular layers** 
- 2 layers
- Receive from rods primarily
- M = motion (for memory)

#### V1, Primary visual cortex
**Brodmann area 17**
Striate cortex
*Cortical magnification*; disproportionately large representation of center of vision in brain

No on-center off-surround at level of V1 
- "Donuts" get larger moving from retinal ganglia towards brain, but stop in V1
==**Simple cells**==
- Interested in change: particular orientations and movements
- Donut → "hot dog"
- Series of circles combine to lines, complex shapes

##### Ocular dominance columns
Neurons don't respond to info from *both* eyes: segregated

These neurons are very flexible; loss of one eye (at young age) → remaining eye columns will grow, lost eye columns will shrink 
- Can we shift it back? If the vision is regained, the columns will not re-enlarge significantly 
##### Orientation columns
- All possible orientations, colors are represented as neurons
- Columns = organization of visual information 


#### Color perception
- Not just wavelength: highly contextualized by knowledge, expectations, understanding
→  \Color is highly **top down**
- Color constancy

#### Theories of color
**Color processing occurs in two stages**
##### Trichromatic theory of color: Young-Helmholtz
- Pre-golgi stain!
- All visual light comprises red, green, and blue light, and all 3 create white
- Therefore, these must be our 3 cell types: correct! We have **short, medium, and long** cone types
##### Opponent process: Hering
- Afterimage inverses color 
- On-center/off-surround cells also includes cones: we are always **comparing** wavelengths 
	- Inverse color is result of lateral inhibition, brain lagging to catch up

**These theories are still insufficient!**

#### Top-down processes
Perceptual constancy (seeing the negative space of a 3D cube, thinking the shadow/light checkered pattern isn't the same color), color constancy, background knowledge 

#### Specialized + Parallel processing
Cortices process at same time in diff places
Many subregions of streams 
*How do we study vision? Primates → Damage testing*

**Dorsal stream from V1 → Posterior Parietal Cortex**
- Movement (magnocellular), depth
- **Where** (and how) pathway
- Spatial task: determining distance, moving in space
	- Damage to dorsal pathway: do well on perception, fail spatial tasks
**Ventral stream from V1 → Inferotemporal Cortex**
- Form, shape, color (parvocellular)
- **What** pathway
- Object recognition tasks
	- Damage to ventral pathway: do well on spatial task, fail perception

**Double dissociation**: these regions have separate, non-overlapping tasks

Perceptual pathways lead further towards *memory*

##### Non-conscious vision? 
**Circadian rhythm** 
- Photoreceptors on retinal ganglion cells (rather than rods or cones!)
- RGC project to superchiasmatic (above chiasm) nucleus
- These cells organize, synchronize cells to Circadian rhythm → blind people retain circadian rhythm b/c these cells slowly perceive light 
- These cells are most sensitive to blue/green light (this is why screens are bad for circadian rhythm)
**Blindsight**
- Can't consciously see (V1 damage) but can guess stimuli with higher-than-chance accuracy: **blindsight**
- Strongly driven by Boston Pizza region

**Summary** 
Visual system: great model for the CNS 
- Active, not passive 
- Relative, not absolute 
- Parallel processing 
- Convergence and divergence 
- Contralateral, -topic organization
