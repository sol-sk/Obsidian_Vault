### Lecture (SLIDES)
#### Cappelen & Denver cont.
[[PHIL351 L15 Worries for tracking#Cappelen & Denver; practicality of philosophy of ANNs mental content]] â†’ 
**Cannot interpret ANNs internal process**
> "Alchemy": Alchemists' theorizing about chemistry was not based on understanding of science, and their theories had to be abandoned in Enlightenment + progress. ANN systems are currently like alchemy.
> 
> Ali Rahimini, qted in Cappelen & Denver

Cappelen & Denver don't think it's going to take another scientific revolution to understand ANNs, but just to recognize that it is a philosophical problem about content ascription, that we don't understand what AI are doing or saying

**These questions are explored in more detail in the dialogue between the philosopher and the skeptic Alfred**

### The frame problem 
[[PHIL351 (T1 2023) - Lecture 14 (relevance and frame problem).pdf]]
- The phrase 'frame problem' is contentious (Shanahan)
- Originally referred to a technical problem in GOFAI abt modelling non-monotonic (revisable, mutable) reasoning without requiring the system to update every single belief: only updating relevant beliefs
- Later, 'frame problem' = problem of explaining 'common-sense' and sensitivity to relevance
- Dietrich et al: computer scientists are reluctant to admit they are dealing w/ a philosophical problem 

**Purports to explain why AI research has been unsuccessful so far in creating truly intelligent systems**
What can and can't computer's do? 

#### The robot parable (Dennett)
R1: needs to rescue its spare battery. Removes it from room with bomb, but pulls the bomb out with the battery. 
R1D1: programmed to understand all implications of its actions. needs to rescue its spare battery. bomb explodes before it can figure out all of the possible implications
R2D1: programmed to understand all implications and ignore irrelevant ones. needs to rescue its spare battery. bomb explodes before it can figure out what implications are relevant.
