#### Glutamate
- Ubiquitous/prototypical neurotransmitter
- de-facto fast transmitter
- Excitatory, but only because of the receptors (could have inhibitory effect on diff receptor)

###### Ionotropic
- AMPA receptors
- NMDA receptors
- Kainate 
> Glutamate receptors, named for the drugs that they bind to 

###### Metabotropic
- mGluR
> metabotropic glutamate receptor (+ # for when it was discovered)
> Some are *inhibitory*: dampens subsequent neurotransmitter release 

**Not a great target for therapeutic drugs**
> Glutamate is too broad-spectrum, affects whole brain to change levels

**Glutamate antagonists**
- Barbiturates
- Nitrous oxide
- Ketamine
- Ethanol
*Depressants/sedatives*

#### GABA
- Primary inhibitory neurotransmitter
- Used throughout brain but less ubiquitous than glutamate
- Iono and metabotropic
- Also not great target for drugs

**GABA agonists**
- Benzos
- Ethanol
- Chloroform
- Ether

### Amines

**All metabotropic**
(except one serotonin receptor)

> Amines "water the lawn" – project to a brain region and release to the whole region all at once
> Modulates whole region

#### Dopamine
> Tangentially related to pleasure, but not like the stereotype
> Not super widely distributed: mostly in basal ganglia

Scientists accidentally dropped electrode on VTA, which projects dopamine to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc)
Rats could press lever to electrically stimulate this area: and they do literally nothing else -> researchers conclude that they really like this
**This leads to the idea that dopamine is the pleasure molecule**

Patient with Parkinson's had electrode in similar part of brain, with same stimulation button: pressed it dozens of times: but *didn't like it*– said it made them feel like they were on the verge of remembering something

**All addictive drugs directly or indirectly increase dopamine transmission**
- Amphetamine, cocaine, heroin, nicotine, oxycodone, ethanol, etc. 

**Parkinson's Disease**
> Damage to sustantia nigra pars compacta (SNc)– one of the two major dopamine-producing regions
> Symptoms only are usually clear when 90% of region is gone

**Dopamine agonist**
> **L-DOPA as PD treatment**: one of the molecules in the dopamine creation process (dopamine is too big to cross blood-brain barrier)
> From brain studies this drug was sort of reverse engineered (it needs to do this, so lets try and make it do it)

Low dopamine is most strongly associated with movement impairment

**Dopamine antagonist**
> Schizophrenia medications
> Bind to dopamine receptors
> Discovered by accident, previously used as sedative
> Note: Y axis on this graph is upside-down

##### Separating Pleasure from Motivation
Salamone (1990s)
- Low effort low reward vs high effort high reward
Dopamine antagonists
- Decrease motivation but not pleasure
- Can be systemic or directly injected into VTA or NAcc
Study: are rats willing to put in more effort for more sugar pellets?
Control group gets the 4
Dopamine antagonist group gets the 2
Dopamine antagonist + no barrier (free access to either reward) gets the 4
	Shows that it was a choice to not put in the effort

**Dopamine related drugs are related to addiction because they relate to motivation**

###### Dopamine and reward prediction error
Schultz et al. (1990s)
- Pavlovian learning
- Use electrode to record action potentials
- Squirt grape juice into mouth: increases dopamine firing

**Light + no reward: decrease in dopamine**

**Dopamine tracks our expectations and helps us learn about the world**

#### Norepinephrine (noreadrenaline)
> Released from **locus coeruleus** (blue location)– one of the nuclei in reticular formation/reticular activating system
> Released across most of brain 
> **Heteroreceptors, heterosynaptic facilitation**: increases function in *another synapse*
> Enhancement of memory by stress/emotion: causes different quality of emotional memories -> 
> Evolutionarily useful: dangerous/scary things are more memorable

#### Epinephrine (adrenaline)

Histamine
Serotonin
