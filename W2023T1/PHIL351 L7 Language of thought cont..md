### Review [[PHIL351 L6 Language of Thought Hypothesis and peripheral vs central cognition]]
Poverty of stimulus arguments
Granting built-in biases/assumptions lets us view a cognitive system's task in terms of the computation of a function (a precise input-output mapping)
	Language learning = tuning the UG to the specific parameters of one's linguistic environment; 
	Vision = calculate the probable distal cause from its effect (proximate retinal stimulus)
Top down analysis: Marr's computational, algorithmic, implementational levels

### Marr, cont.
#### Processing hierarchy (Marr)

#### Functional decomposition
> Marr found limited role for neuroscience: brain lesion studies
> 	Can be used to distinguish cognitive subsystems

Leads to understanding of ventral vs dorsal visual systems, subcategories of memory (long vs short-term, episodic vs semantic, declarative vs procedural)

Marr's multi-level explanatory framework begins to answer the question "what is cognitive science?"
	*Interdisciplinary endeavor of uncovering, via top-down functional analysis, the fine grained computational structure of the (human) mind.* 

#### Language of thought hypothesis
> S thinks that P if and only if S is cognitively related to a sentence (in S's intternal LOT)

All thinking and reasoning takes place in a language
	The language in which thinking occurs *should not be confused with natural language*; it *presupposes* natural language; it is ***computational***

clear, systematic articulation of the basic presuppositions of classical cognitive science

All thoughts possess two constituents: 
	Propositional content
		The thought expressed
	Propositional attitude
		How the subject is thinking or cognitively related to the thought
#### Fodor
> Refers to the language of thought as "Mentalese" to denote its separation from public language (internal language)

Situates this idea historically: Previous philosophers attempted to describe thinking and reasoning in mechanical terms, causal sequence of ideas/representations

Computational theory of mind (CTM) is a new version of old representational TM (RTM)
	Mind is turing machine
