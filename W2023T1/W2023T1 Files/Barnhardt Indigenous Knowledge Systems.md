- Alaskan context
- Comparing Indigenous and Western knowledge systems and worldviews, understanding that generalizations are being made because there is diversity within both:
- Western science and education typically emphasizes compartmentalized knowledge which is decontextualized, taught in a classroom or laboratory
- Indigenous people traditionally acquire knowledge through direct experience in the natural world. “Particulars are understood in relation to the whole, and “laws” are tested in context of everyday survival”
- Western competency: assessed based on predetermined ideas or what one should know, measured indirectly through “objective” tests
- Indigenous competency: survival or extinction, knowledge tested in real-world
- Western science has been shifting towards the understanding of nonlinear interconnected systems, and patterns within previously thought as random phenomena: complementarity emerging
