Background on indigenous history in Canada and US
"The point is not so much that Indigenous perspectives need to be included in the general politics of knowledge (though that is true); rather it is that the Indigenous itself is generative of that knowledge, not peripheral to it. Indigenous studies is not just about Indigenous people. It’s also about ways of seeing and investigating the world that have proven central." (15)
