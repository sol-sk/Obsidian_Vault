"Traditional" vs "scientific" ways of knowing
WT: Western Tradition/T(E)K: Traditional (ecological) knowledge
**

Dods “Knowing ways/ways of knowing” 

- Connaissance: Western tradition (WT), declarative statements with truth value, exclusionary of other sets of statements
    

- Supplementary conditions; reproducibility (under explicit conditions for observation) and appropriate language (deemed relevant by experts)
    
- “Fruits of savoir will be consumed (or consumerized) by the practitioners of connaissance” (548)
    

- Savoir; notions of know-how, “knowing how to live, how to listen”
    

- Ethical wisdom, auditory and visual sensibilities
    
- ‘makes it possible to distinguish one who knows from one who doesn't (the foreigner, the child) is what constitutes the culture of a people.’ Lyotard 1987: 78-9
