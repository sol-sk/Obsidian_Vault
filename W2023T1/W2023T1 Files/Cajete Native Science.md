Cajete Native Science, Chapter 2 “Philosophy of Native Science”

- This book is cited by several other sources presented, and is one of the most significant early published works which have created and contributed to the study and consideration of Indigenous epistemology.
    

- Cajete argues that cosmology is the contextual foundation for philosophy: a grand guiding story which speculates on the origin, characteristics, and essential nature of the universe. This cosmology gives rise to philosophy, values, and action, which then form the foundation of a society. 
    
- Western cosmology has produced a guiding philosophy centered on power and “business”: profit
    
- **Faustian
    
- “Actions have literally no frames of reference other than individual gratification and institutional profit and include the plunder of the natural world as a means to self-serving ends.” (59)
    

“Because the current worldview causes escalation of our destructive relationship with the environment at every level of life, human meaning atrophies. The emerging environmental cosmology will be in conflict with the popular mechanistic view. This ‘cosmic’ conflict can be seen in the energy underlying philosophical, political, religious, and economic debates all over the world. A modern ‘ecosophy’ would be about the rediscovery of meaning as it relates to our universe.” (60)**
