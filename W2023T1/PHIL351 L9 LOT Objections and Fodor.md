## Lecture
**Motivations for LOT (summary):**
> productivity
> systematicity
> rational coherence (accommodating  the causal and rational roles of representation)
> translation between sub-personal and person vocabularies

#### Distinction between sub-personal and personal? 
#### Expertise / "know how"
How do we express non-verbal knowledge in LOT? ie tying shoes is easily accessed and difficult to describe verbally
#### Worries about classicism
Paul Churchland: 
> Classicism overstates the centrality of language to intelligence. Consequently, it explains only a small fraction of human intelligence and approximately none of nonhuman intelligence

##### Objections: 
F1: Neurological 
	"The brain does not work the way that GOFAI does. AI is extremely fast, but consists of relatively few serial loci of activity / Brain operations are roughly 50 million times slower, deriving their power from massive parallelism."

F2: Perceptual 
	"Perception would merely involve determining what objects were 'out there,' what properties they manifested, what types or categories they belong to, and so on. It did not work out that way." (p.24)

F3: Epistemological
	"Thinking and intelligence, on the GOFAI model, consisted of rational, articulated steps, on its founding model of logical inference ... in many situations a more accurate characterization of intelligence is one of skillful coping or navigation*â€“of being 'thrown' into individual and social projects in which we are embedded and enmeshed* ... emerges a horizon of *ineffable* knowledge and sense-making." (p.27)

F4: Ontological
	One of the ultimate failures of GOFAI is the assumption that reality possesses a pre-given structure of which our representations are a mirror. We exist in a *non-conceptual world*

#### Classicism response to these objections:
If you were (or are) a proponent of the classical approach, how would/do you respond to each of these challenges?

**Tacit knowledge**
Knowledge (aka representation) which is *inaccessible* to the person/agent 

#### Fodor, on tying one's shoes (tacit knowledge): 
> Homunculus in our head has a library of information, including a book of step by step instructions on tying shoes. He presses buttons that activate our motor (in his description, literal cogs and levers) pathway which does the action, ie take the left free end of the shoelace in the left hand. This continues until the instructions end with the word "end" at which point he puts the book back on the shelf

Subsystems = black box (agent lacks direct access)
However, within these subsystems, there are computations over mental representations (symbols)
	If so, LOT theorists can accept that, in general, knowing how to do *x* doesn't imply knowing how to *verbally explain* how to do *x*, while also affirming that knowledgeable *x*-ing consists in the formal manipulation of symbols
#### Fodor - Modularity of Mind
> account of cognitive architecture of the human mind

##### Vertical versus horizontal organization:
Vertical organizes mind by contents/purpose
Horizontal organizes mind by kinds of process
