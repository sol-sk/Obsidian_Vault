#### Rat thoughts
##### Tasks to assess cognition: 
Morris water maze:
- Rats learn where platform is *in space*: learning and memory, spatial reasoning
- Classic way to study hippocampus function bc it tests both explicit and implicit memory 
5 choice serial reaction time task 
- Skinner box with 5 holes, one of which lights up
- Every time they correctly identify which lights up they get a sugar cube
- Increase difficulty by shortening the duration of the light (stimulus duration), requiring closer attention
- 5 second inter-trial pause where the rat cannot poke or it will time out the next stim
Classical vs Operant conditioning
- Operant conditioning is basis for many animal models; reward/punishment 
T-maze: can have reward/no reward, reward/punishment, easy/difficult, etc. 
**Testing motivation, learning, decision making**

Quality of model is determined by quality of **behavioral assay** 
- Construct validity
- Notable offender: forced-swim test (FST)
	- Used as model of depression/test severity of depression

##### Why use animal models? 
Because they map well onto humans!
Mammalian brain similarity
Animal cognition is sophisticated
- They can drive!

#### Drug "challenge"
Potential routes:
- Intramuscular
- Intravenous
- Subcutaneous
	- Very easy to do on rats but has delayed and less intense effects
- Intraperitoneal 
	- Most common
- Intraventricular
	- overcomes problems with drugs passing the blood-brain barrier
- Multiple doses is best
	- Within subjects design
	- Saline only = vehicle (placebo/control)
	- Usually only one is allowed in humans
Cannabis study: 
- Rats with higher dose of cannabis made them less motivated to put effort in 

#### Invasive electrical recording methods
- Four Invasive Electrophysiological recording methods
	- Intracellular unit recording 
		- Unit probably = neuron, but could be multiple neurons firing simultaneously
	- Extracellular unit recording 
	- Multiple-unit recording 
	- Invasive EEG recording

#### Stereotaxic surgery 
- For lesions, optogenetics, electrodes, more
- Employs stereotaxis atlas and instrument
	- Requires sub-millimeter accuracy 
- Allows accurate placement of lesions, probes, electrodes
- Reference point used is bregma![[Screen Shot 2023-11-02 at 10.08.05 AM.png]]

#### Lesion methods
- Chemical ie excitotoxic lesion
	- Quinolinic acid (for larger lesions: diffuses more), ibotenic acid (for small lesions)
	- **Excitotoxic**: causing so much activity that it kills neurons
- Selective chemical lesions
	- Killing only dopamine neurons to create model for Parkinson's: 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)
	- 5,7-dihydroxytriptamine (5,7-DHT) kills only serotonin neurons, which causes extreme aggression
- Reversible lesions, aka inactivations
	- Using GABA to inactivate brain area for short period of time
	- Cannulae
	- Baclofen + muscimol: GABA agonists 
	- Benefit: within-subjects design!
- Interpretation of lesion studies
- Ideal post-surgery testing window?
	- Don't wait enough: recovery + surgery drugs impact behavior
	- Wait too long: rat brain has recovered partially
- Unilateral vs bilateral vs. contralateral 
	- Half of hippocampus would usually allow for good performance on memory tasks (unilateral), but bilateral hippocampus lesion would severely impact
	- Contralateral: damaging one brain region on one side and another related region on the other side: do these areas work together on a construct (e.g. attention, memory, etc.)

#### Optogenetics
- Light-gated ion channels
	- Isolated gene from algae and inserted into rat: attach only to specific region, neurotransmitter, or cell type (eg. glia)
	- Generate action potentials by shining light on neurons
		- Challenge can be backwards propagation, where the signal travels to non-targeted parts of brain
	- Channelrhodopsins
- Use system-specific transcription factors
- Can be used for both recording/mapping and manipulation![[Screen Shot 2023-11-02 at 10.22.36 AM.png]]

#### Revisiting stains
- Golgi 
- Nissl
- Fibre stains
	- Luxol-fast blue (LFB)
	- Toluidine blue 
- Green fluorescent protein (GFP)
	- Many derivatives (YFP, BFP)
	- Can be inserted into living cells (eg. single-neuron electroporation)
		- Change voltage on one cells membrane, making it easier for things to go into cell (allows us to insert GFP into cell)
	- Observe neuron being exposed to light for the first time growing over the course of a few hours, made possible by GFP

# Exam 3
### Neuroimaging: Structural and functional
In most cases we cannot measure brain voltage (EEG = exception)
**Static/Structural**
- Map of structure
- Computerized axial tomography (CAT/CT)
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
- Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
**Dynamic/Functional**
- Moment to moment activity
- Positron emission tomography (PET)
- Functional MRI (fMRI)
- Resting-state functional connectivity MRA (rsfcMRI)

##### Computed tomography (CT)
- Old: emerged in early 70s (first imaging)
- Fires x-rays from many angles
- Computer reconstruction: uses "slices" or frames to create 3D model
- Only as good as its algorithms
	- Programs have improved significantly since 70s but the images themselves have not
- Useful for: diagnostics
- Drawbacks: can't make any sense of what brain tissue you're looking at: can see tissue vs fluid but not what kind of tissue or fluid: wouldn't be able to see tumor 

##### Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
- Same basic idea as CT: reconstruction from a series of images
- Magnet thousands of times stronger than earth's magnetic field
- Makes all our atoms align on their north-south poles, then sends pulses which knock them out of alignment, then pulled back into alignment 
	- **Relaxation**: going back to alignment after being knocked out
- Relaxation releases energy, which the machine records
- No radiation so much safer 
- Voxels are 1mm^3

##### Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
- Looking at relaxation in specific parts of brain: algorithm which isolates movement in water molecules only
- Water trapped in axon has restricted movement vs free, random movement
	- We can see tracts/white matter bundles
- Useful for measuring differences
