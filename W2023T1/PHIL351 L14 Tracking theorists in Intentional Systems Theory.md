### Pre class reading

Introduction and Chapter 1

### Recap
**Searle**
**Syntax can never be semantics**
> "As long as it simulates only the formal structure (of the system) it won't have simulated what matters about the brain, namely its causal properties, its ability to produce intentional states" 

We cognitive agent attribute meanings to a computer's internal states and outputs, but what meanings they possess derive from the intrinsic meaning of our mental states
### Approaches to Intentionality
**Original vs Derived Intentionality**
> "Intentionality, however, is not all created equal. At least some outward symbols (for instance, a secret signal that you and I have agreed on) have their intentionality only derivatively (the agreement). Derivative intentionality must derive eventually from something that is not similarly derivative (original). This original intentionality is the real metaphysical problem; for the possibility of delegating content, once there is some to delegate, is surely less puzzling than how there can be any in the first place." ("Intentionality All Stars" 385)
> Haugeland (abbreviated somewhat)

We could use this distinction to modify Brentano's thesis to say 
all and only mental states possess intrinsic, original, or non-derived intentionality.
→ Searle affirms this interpretation of Brentano's thesis

**Overview**
Intentional systems theory/interpretivism (Dennett)
- 3rd person stance
Causal theories 
- 3rd person stance
Phenomenal intentionality (Searle, Dietrich)
- 1st person stance

#### Intentional systems theory and interpretivism
- Anchors our account of intentional content in the 3rd-personal perspective of an *interpreter*
- Content is determined by the *most charitable/rational* interpretation of an agent's behavior 
- Mental states aren't unobservable internal causes of behavior but observable patterns in prediction and explanation
	- Not speculation: determining best explanation
- Strongly **externalist**: depends on individual's environment


Sometimes the distinction between original and derived is challenged (Dennett)
→ Chinese Room experiment response
- Systems reply; system does understand bc this is most useful interpretation
- Other interpretivists may insist on more context which are absent in thought experiment (historical, env, causal-functional factors)
Standard worries for these views:
- Anti-realism? Realistic to just say "it makes most sense for system to be thinking"?
- What is the status of this interpreter? Theory does not include the perspective of theorist

#### **Causal theories**
- Take "theories" more seriously
- Believe mental representations are causally efficacious internal states of a subject whose nature is not settled by interpretive practices of a linguistics community → is this required to be a realist?
- Relate to: About-ness is doing , robots reply
- Response to Chinese room: could claim there is understanding (because about-ness is determined by interrelation of symbols), or claim that Searle's system is not *functionally* equivalent to a native Chinese speaker (despite being *behaviorally identical*)
##### **'Tracking'**
- Tracking theorists ask about relationships between parts of internal system and aspects of **environment** (how do they causally co-vary)
- Moral of the Chinese room: we must ask about the systems *causal relationships* with entities *outside the system*
##### **Teleofunctional indicator semantics**
X represents Y if and only if X has the proper function of reliably indicating Y (**indexical**, altho more to it than that)
Biological/evolutionary framing: X has the effect Y because those Xs that didn't have the function of Y died out
- e.g. certain neural populations in the mammalian visual system are said to be "feature detectors" → these neurons detect various classes of stimuli BUT they can malfunction and misrepresent

**Worries for Tracking**
"functional indeterminsey problem"
