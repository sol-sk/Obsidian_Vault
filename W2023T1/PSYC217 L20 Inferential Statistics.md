Learning objectives
- Differentiate between population, probabilistic trend, and sample
- Understand the relation between sample size and accuracy in estimation population values
- Explain the common errors in judgment that people make


#### Sample vs Population
Population level
- How effective is the Pfizer vaccine for COVID?
Probabilistic trend 
- The expected effectiveness at the population level; often applied to a study
Random sample
- In any random group of people, how effective is the pfizer vaccine for COVID?
As sample size increases, the pattern in the sample will come closer to **overall population value** (which is impossible to know)

**Samples are imperfect**
Probabilistic trend; what should we expect to see? 
- Not likely to be reflected in every sample and case? 
Random sample from population to estimate true effect

##### **Common error 1:** Failing to account for sample size
- Smaller sample size is more likely to be further from ideal value


#### Inferential Statistics 
Use *sample* data to infer what's happening in the population
- *Is the effect we found due to chance or is it a true effect?*

##### Example: How to study?
IV: Study method
- S(tudy)SSS, SSSR(ecall), SRRR
Tested on material after 1 week
- Expectation of remembering material: SSSS group expects to do best 
- Actual result: SRRR does best

##### Common error 2: Failure to appropriately use probabilities
"Person who" or base-rate fallacy: taking one example to the contrary as proof against the pattern

Gambler's fallacy: "i'm due for X result"
- Rolling 3 even die: chance of rolling a 4th even die? 


##### Overview: 
- Null and research hypotheses
- Sampling distribution
- t-test logic
- Statistically signifiacnt 
- Type 1 and type 2 errors
