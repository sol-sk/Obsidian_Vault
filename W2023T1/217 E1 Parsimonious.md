##### Parsimonious
> [[PSYC217 L3 Scientific Process#Parsimony]]
> "Simpler" has two meanings: 
> 	Requires fewer conceptual relationships assumptions
> 	Requires fewer adjustments to established relationships in science

**Implications for falsifiability**
> Fewer conceptual relationships (assumptions) = less data required to counter a theory
> Fewer adjustments to established relationships in science = less data required to test adjustments
> We are evaluating the *whole theory*
