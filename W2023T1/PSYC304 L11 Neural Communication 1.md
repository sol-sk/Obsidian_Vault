#### Sodium Potassium Pump
Uses ATP: This is what makes brain use so much energy
Embedded in cell membrane 
Pushes 3 Na+ out and 2 K+ in

**Potassium leak channels**
K+ can move freely via K+ “leak” channels that are always open 
Na+ cannot move freely across the membrane 
	It has channels, but they are **usually closed**

Point of equilibrium = *resting membrane potential*

**Cells are polarized**

> What is resting membrane potential / how is it generated / what proteins are responsible

When a neurotransmitter molecule binds to a postsynaptic receptor, it can have one of two localized effects:
1. **Depolarize** the membrane (e.g. decrease membrane potential from -70 to -67: more positive) - more positive
2. **Hyperpolarize** the membrane (e.g. increase the membrane potential from -70 to -72) - more negative

**Post-synaptic potential**: change in voltage, usually on dendrites 

**Depolarization = excitatory**
	EPSP, Excitatory postsynaptic potential
	Gets cell closer to firing action potential
**Hyperpolarization = inhibitory**
	IPSP, Inhibitory postsynaptic potential
	Decreases likelihood of action potential

**Postsynaptic potentials are *graded, rapid, and decremental***
- Different amplitudes
- PSPs travel like an electrical signal along an uninsulated wire
- Decremental: signal gets weaker as it goes down

**EPSPs and IPSPs sum both spatially and temporally:**

- Can make stronger (same voltage combining), or cancel each other out

EPSP/IPSP has the strongest influence the closer to the axon they are 

If the sum of PSPs that reaches the axon initial segment is sufficient to depolarize the membrane above its threshold of excitation (-55mV) then an action potential (AP) is generated
	The AP is a massive momentary reversal of the membrane potential (can be over 100mV difference)

#### Action potential
Main method of brain communication
Binary state: either on or off

##### Rapid huge depolarization
AP generation and conduction are both the result of **voltage activated** ion channels, primarily Na+ 
	Na channels open: Na+ into cell: rapid huge depolarization (at membrane), and then shut-off automatically after ~1ms
		3 states: closed, open, and inactivated (stage 3)

> Little purple ball = **inactivation gate**

Na+ channels stay inactivated until membrane goes back to resting potential
	No action potentials until reset: absolute refractory period (around 2 ms)

##### Repolarization
K+ channels: even more open during AP- some are voltage gated
Membrane is now pos, so K+ wants to flow out chemically as well as electrically
	Slow closing of voltage-gated K+ channels leads to hyperpolarization phase and the **relative refractory period**
	Na+/K+ pump restores ion balance over time
**You can have an AP during relative refractory period**
	Takes more EPSPs because of more negativity
Na+/K+ pump restores ion balance over time (slow)

##### Subthreshold stimulation
Excitatory potential is produced but fades away; decades

##### Suprathreshold stimulation
An excitatory potential is produced that exceeds the threshold of excitation and produces an AP that continues **undiminished** down the axon

##### Conduction on an unmyelinated axon
Na+ (gated) channels present along axon
	Domino effect: one set opening opens the next
	Cause depolarization phase
	The more channels, the slower the conduction
Voltage spreads in both directions: but **conduction only travels in one**
	Due to *absolute refractory period*
