### Quasi-Experimental "Special" Designs

#### Single case
ABA reversal design
	Establishes baseline, implements IV, then returns to baseline
	But: what if confound co-occurs with IV? ->
ABAB reversal design
	Multiple implementations of IV to reduce probability of confound
*These both suffer from lack of generalizability*
Multiple baseline design
#### Quasi-experiments
> No randomization
> Use pre-existing groups or allow for participant self-sorting
> Used when randomization is not possible or realistic (such as in cultural psychology)

One-group posttest only
	One group only, and you only do a posttest
One-group pretest-posttest
	One group, and you establish a pre-test condition with a pretest (duh) to compare to 
	Could still be result of a confound or third variable
Nonequivalent control group
	Control group differs by a collective participant variable
Nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest

**Quasi-experiment vs correlation:** 
	No randomization 
	Outcome variables are measured
QE: 
	Can deal with multiple discrete groups without inherent order
CS:
	Can deal with only two discrete groups without inherent order

##### Threats to internal validity
**History**
	External event that could have affected participants, especially between first and second measurements (ie. midterms affecting students performance/response)
**Maturation**
	People change over time (fatigue effect, get hungrier, more mature, etc.) independent of manipulation
**Testing**
	Taking a pretest is enough to change a participant's behavior
**Instrument decay**
	Characteristics of a measure, or people's use of a measure, changes over time
**Regression toward the mean:**
	Participants who are selected because of their extreme scores, tend to subsequently score closer to the mean
