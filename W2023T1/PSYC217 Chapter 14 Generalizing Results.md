1. LO1 Discuss four challenges to generalizing research results to populations other than the population sampled. 
2. LO2 Identify three specific aspects of a studyâ€™s procedure that may affect the ability to generalize beyond that study, and suggest possible solutions. 
3. LO3 Discuss the importance of replications, distinguishing the procedures and uses of direct replications and conceptual replications. 
4. LO4 Evaluate the strengths and limitations of using convenience samples, and identify ways to find more diverse samples. 
5. LO5 Distinguish between narrative literature reviews and meta-analyses. 
6. LO6 Identify ways to continue using your knowledge of research methods.

##### Conceptual replication 
> replication using different procedures than the original study, such as a different dependent measure or different manipulation.

##### Direct replication 
> replication following the same procedures, as closely as possible.

##### External validity 
> generalizability to the population from which the sample was drawn or other populations.

##### Literature review 
> A narrative summary of the past research conducted on a particular topic.

##### Meta-analysis 
> A statistical procedure for combining the results of many past studies in order to provide an estimate of the effect-size for this general phenomenon.

##### Replication 
> Repeating a study to see if one observes the same result, to increase confidence in that result or demonstrate that it is not systematically observable
### Review Questions
1. Why should a researcher be concerned about generalizing to other participant populations? What are some of the generalization problems that a researcher might confront? 
2. What is the source of the problem of generalizing to other experimenters? How can this problem be solved? 
3. Why might a pretest present a problem for generalization? 
4. Distinguish between a direct replication and a conceptual replication. What is the value of each?
5. What is a meta-analysis? What is the purpose of a meta-analysis? How does it differ from a literature review? 
6. List three ways you might continue to use your knowledge of research methods in the future.
