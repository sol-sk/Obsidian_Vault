Mateiviti-Tulavu, Eseta K.. “Connecting identities and relationships through Indigenous epistemology: the Solomoni of Fiji.” (2013).

- This source focuses on Fiji and Solomon Islands
- Defining Indigenous knowledge:  
> “Johnson identifies, the following characteristics of indigenous knowledge: it is locally bound or indigenous to a specific area; it is culture and context specific; it is transmitted orally and undocumented; it is not static and changes as society changes socially, economically and culturally; it belongs to the community (communally owned) (Johnson, 1992).” (33)

> “He characterizes Pacific indigenous epistemologies as practice oriented; communal, dialogic and situated; based on rationalism (reason) and empiricism (experience) inextricably connected and mutually informing each other; uses the five senses (sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste); memory, reflection, introspection and based on dream, revelation, intuition and telepathy (Gegeo, 2006).” (34)

- Space and relation are foundational to Kwara’ae epistemology: where one exists and is oriented from, and familial/genealogical ties 
- Space is, for Kwara’ae, eternal until they disappear from “the face of the earth”
> “On the same note Chapman (1991; 1992) sees that space as belonging to an individual in motion. This means that no matter where or how far a person travels or how long the person is absent from home his/her space will always be there. The way Gegeo defines space in terms of epistemology is the way the people of Nayaulevu in Fiji also define space.” (35)
