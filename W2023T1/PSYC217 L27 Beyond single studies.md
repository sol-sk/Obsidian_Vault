### Beyond single studies: 
#### Triangulate
- Using different methodologies: eg. correlational, experimental/causal, behavioral
#### Replicate
**Diff types of replication**
##### Conceptual replication
- What was orig. study trying to examine? → **Idea** behind study 
- New study design/materials are *conceptually* similar to orig.
- Do orig findings persist w diff methodology?
Problems: 
- Could be changing things significantly so as to measure something less effectively or even measuring something not conceptually related

##### Direct replication
- Was original finding **real or by chance?**
- Replication copies exactly the methodology and materials
- Compensates for problems with conceptual replicaitons
Problems:
- Interaction effects, history effects
- If original design had problems then those confounds will remain 
##### Replication-plus extension
- Was orig effect real and what else can we do w/ it? 
- New study: partially uses same materials but adds additional parts to address additional questions
#### Meta-analyses
- Across all studies, how strong is the overall effect?
- Statistical estimate of overall effect size
Problem? 
- Publication bias (publishing only significant studies): overestimate effect size bc published studies are mostly rejecting null hypothesis
	- So, researchers doing meta-analyses will reach out to others to ask for *unpublished* data
#### Publishing null studies
- Journals specifically for publishing nulls ("Journal of articles in support of the null hypothesis")
- Packaging non-significant results with significant in a study 

### Replication crisis
Many results from psych studies cannot be replicated by either orig researchers or other researchers due to questionable research practices (QRPs)/p-hacking

→ Task forces, committees established to address issues

#### Questionable studies
**Daryl Bem – Evidence for extrasensory perception**
- Type 1 error

**Lady Macbeth effect**
- When people are reminded of shameful things they did in past they are driven to clean themselves
- not replicable

### Open Science
[[COGS303 L8 Replication Crisis and HARKing#Open Science]]
- Movement to allow data an dresearch to be accessibl e to everyone
- Encourages transparency, community, and collaboration
- Allows for better scrutiny and quality assessment of research
#### Preprints
- Unpublished work, published online, publically accessible
- Drawback: Generally not peer reviewed :( 
- If not permitted to make research available freely after publishing, researchers can upload "preprints"
#### ***Psychological Science's* Open Badges**
- Open data: Authors provide data for anyone to access and analyze
- Open materials: Authors provide study materials for anyone to access and check/replicate
- Pre-registration: Authors register hypothesis and analysis plan before running study: prevent HARKing

#### Registered replication reports (RRRs)
- Write proposal to register hypothesis
- Register materials and plan of analysis
- Upload data and all analyses
- Write report to address reproducibility of registered hypothesis
