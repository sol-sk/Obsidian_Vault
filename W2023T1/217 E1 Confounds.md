##### Experimenter Expectancy Effect 
[[PSYC217 L7 Study design cont.#Demand characteristics]] cont.
> Experimenter knows what conditions participants are in, **unconsciously** manipulates an experiment in order to find the expected effect
> 	Threat to internal validity
> 	Examples: police line up, hans the horse

##### Double blind study
> Researchers and participants both don't know which are in which conditions

##### Computer study
> Have a computer run the study, minimizing interactions between the researcher and participant
> 	Makes undergrad research more difficult :( 
##### Interaction effects
> Various social components of the researcher/ participant interaction may affect the results
> 	Biosocial 
> 		When perceived biological characteristics of the researcher impact the participant's response
> 	Psychosocial effects
> 		When the perceived social characteristics of the individual have an impact on the participants responses
> Research assistant behavior and appearance should be standardized as much as possible, and each RA should run all conditions 


##### Detecting effect
> Optimizing our operational definitions of IV and DV
> 	Avoid *floor + ceiling* effects
> Appropriately pairing IV and DV

**Ceiling effect**
> Task is too easy: everybody does very well, very little variability, hard to detect IV effect

Floor effect
> Task is too hard: everybody does very bad, very little variability, hard to detect IV effect
