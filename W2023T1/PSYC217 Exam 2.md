### Review:
2. Compare and contrast quasi-experimental and correlational designs 
> No randomization
> Use pre-existing groups or allow for participant self-sorting
> Used when randomization is not possible or realistic (such as in cultural psychology)
1. Explain how 5 threats to internal validity affect interpretation of results 
	1. Measurement decay, history, regression to mean, attrition, ?? 
2. Recognize and explain examples of threats to internal validity

##### **Special and Quasi-experimental design objectives - L11 + 12**
1. Identify different special designs that are neither experimental nor correlational 
	1. Program evaluation, longitudinal/sequential, single participant
2. ==Compare and contrast quasi-experimental and correlational designs== 
> No randomization
> Use pre-existing groups or allow for participant self-sorting
> Used when randomization is not possible or realistic (such as in cultural psychology)

> Weak to all: ABA reversal, one-group pretest-posttest
##### Chapter 10 (quasi-experiment) objectives
1. LO1 Describe the purpose of program evaluation research and five types of questions that program evaluations can seek to address. 
	1. Problem: identify what needs to be fixed
	2. Population
	3. Strategy 
	4. Efficacy 
	5. Cost effectiveness
2. LO2 Compare and contrast the one-group posttest-only design with the one- group pretest-posttest design. 
	1. It is quite literally in the name. Pretest is stronger, obviously, but neither are true experiments so results can't really be extrapolated. Posttest is sometimes only option.
3. LO3 Describe threats to internal validity for quasi-experimental designs. 
	1. Historical, regression to the mean
	2. Generally because there's less control there's less concrete meaning in results
4. LO4 Discuss the advantages of having a non-equivalent control group, and compare and contrast the non-equivalent control group design with the non- equivalent control group pretest-posttest design.
	1. Non equivalent control group = if participants are self selected or if they are selected based on prior behavior (smoking example)
	2. pretest-posttest design can at least establish the different baselines for both groups to better compare results
5. LO5 Distinguish between the **interrupted time series design and control series design.** 
	1. Interrupted time series design: thing is introduced
		1. ===Examines data before and after manipulation, ie. passing a traffic law===
	2. Control series design: ABA (return to non-experimental condition after treatment)
		1. ==Interrupted time + control group ie. compare to province that doesn't pass a traffic law lol==
6. LO6 Describe single case experimental designs and discuss reasons to use these designs.
	1. **Single participant**
		- Participant's behavior is measured during baseline control period
		- Manipulation is introduced during a treatment period
		- Change in participants behavior between baseline and treatment period: evidence for effectiveness of manipulation
7. LO7 Compare cross-sectional, longitudinal, and sequential research designs, including the advantages and disadvantages of each design
	1. We know all of this ok

##### **Factorial design objectives - L12 + 13**
1. Interpret main effects and interaction from a graph and a table 
	1. Yep 
2. Explain an interaction effect using simple main effects
	1. Simple main effects: the mean of the scores across a single IV manipulation
	2. Interaction: when the score is dependent on the presence of both IVs
3. Explain IV x PV designs 
	1. Since we can't manipulate PV; not a true experiment
	2. PV functions same as IV, with diff groups having different variables in common ie. race, gender, etc. 
4. Differentiate between crossed factorial designs and nested factorial designs
	1. When there are sub-conditions vs when every condition is matched with every other condition
##### Chapter 11 (factorial) objectives
1. LO1 Define a factorial design and discuss reasons why a researcher would use this design. 
	1. To investigate multiple IVs and if they affect each other's outcomes. 
2. LO2 Describe what information is provided by main effects and interaction effects in a factorial design. 
	1. Main effects: the result of a single IV manipulation. Interaction effects: the result of the overlap of the IVs
3. LO3 Interpret a graph depicting results from a 2 × 2 experimental design. Use this graph to estimate whether there is one main effect, two main effects, and/or an interaction effect. 
4. LO4 Discuss the role of simple main effects in interpreting interactions. 
	1. Interactions can be seen when the graphed lines of different IV manipulations are not parallel; the levels of the simple main effects 
5. LO5 Describe an independent variable by participant variable (IV × PV) design. 
6. LO6 Compare the assignment of participants in a between-subjects design, a within-subjects design, and a mixed factorial design.
	1. Between subjects: needs separate group of participants for each cell/condition: no overlap 
	2. Within subjects: every subject experiences every cell/condition
	3. Mixed factorial: each subject experiences 2 cells. 
##### **Ethics objectives - L14**
1. Identify research considered minimal risk 
	1. Non-vulnerable population, no privacy concerns, no risk higher than daily life
2. ==Describe the basic procedures for ethical clearance of research (both human and animal) at UBC== 
> Must be approved by REB 
> Participants sign consent form
1. Explain when a researcher would want to conceal the true hypothesis from participants and why 
	1. Avoid demand characteristics
2. ==Use the principles of the Belmont Report to evaluate the ethical issues of research using systematic observation, deception, or animals==
> Concern for welfare/beneficence:  Physical harm? Psychological/Emotional harm? Social risk? Privacy & Confidentiality
> Respect for persons/autonomy: debriefing
> Justice: voice for the vulnerable, consent, advantage taken: special process for ethical clearance for research
> 
##### Chapter 3 (ethics) objectives
1. LO1 Discuss the three core ethical principles for research with human participants, as outlined in the Tri-Council Policy Statement. 
	1. Justice, welfare, autonomy. Ensuring privacy, accurately outlining what will occur in informed consent letter, minimizing risk, distributing benefits and risks equally among populations, protecting vulnerable populations
2. LO2 List and describe some of the potential risks and **benefits** of research. 
	3. Psychological, physical, or social harm. Benefits include discovery of potential treatments or use of new treatments, financial
3. LO3 Describe why informed consent is used despite the potential challenges to obtaining it. 
	1. Informed consent is the best way of ensuring that participants are willing to go through the experiment despite potentially negative things that they could experience. Challenges are demand characteristics and reactivity, which is why deception is sometimes used. 
4. LO4 Describe the purpose and process of debriefing research participants. 
	1. Debriefing describes the experiment, why it was done the way it was, the expected results, and the purpose of the research. If deception was used, it's explained.
5. LO5 Describe the function of a Research Ethics Board (REB). 
	1. To investigate potential non-minimal risk research at the institutional level
6. LO6 Contrast the categories of risk to participants: exempt, minimal risk, and greater than minimal risk. 
	1. Exempt; ie. program evaluations, use of anonymous pre-existing data, minimal risk: no greater harm than in daily life, greater than minimal risk: greater harm than in daily life, vulnerable populations, or sensitive information eg. illegal drug use
7. LO7 Describe how the ==“Three Rs”== are used to minimize harm to animals in research. 
	1. ensuring as few animals are needed as possible, that as little harm comes to them as possible in the experiment, & using computer models if possible ** review 3 Rs
> **replacement, refinement, reduction**
8. LO8 Discuss professional ethics issues, including scientific misconduct and transparency reform
	1. Scientific misconduct = fraud (eg. p-hacking, fake data), plagiarism, transparency reform= data won't go to companies and other 3rd parties that patients are unaware and not consenting to

##### **Measurement Reliability and Validity objectives - L15 + 16** + 17
1. State the key questions used to evaluate a measure 
	1. Does this measure the same thing every time it is used? Does this measurement accurately reflect the studied construct? Does this measure predict related measures? 
2. Define reliability & its types 
	1. Test-retest, inter-rater, internal
3. Define construct validity & its types
	1. Face, predictive, concurrent, convergent, discriminant

##### Chapter 5 (measurement) objectives
1. LO1 Define the reliability of a measure and describe the differences among test-retest, **internal consistency**, and inter-rater reliability. 
	1. Reliability of a measurement: the strength of a belief that it is collecting data in a way that is consistent and expected to. Test-retest: same measurement is used within same participants at times 1 and 2. Internal consistency: diff parts of survey measure the same thing (*Cronbach's alpha*) inter-rater reliability: a judge/rater evaluates participants to check that participants self-eval is consistent with rater's (*Cohen's kappa*)
2. LO2 Compare and contrast reliability and validity. 
	1. Validity more concerns the operationalization of a construct (conceptual -> practical), while reliability is that the measurement is doing the same thing/collecting the same information about the participant every time it is used
3. LO3 Describe how a researcher can build a case for construct validity, including predictive validity, concurrent validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. 
	1. Predictive validity: the researcher can show that there is a strong correlation between scores on their measurement and, at a later time, scores on a different conceptually linked measurement (ie. a score on an anxiety test accurately predicts frequency of X anxious behavior in a month)
	2. Concurrent validity: strong correlation between measurement and a related measurement done at the same time 
	3. Convergent validity: correlation with conceptually linked measurement
	4. discriminant: not correlated with conceptually unrelated measurement
4. LO4 Describe the problem of reactivity for a measure and discuss ways to minimize reactivity. 
	1. Participants acting in reaction to the measurement
5. LO5 Describe the properties of the four scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.
	1. Nominal: no numerical value to measurement
	2. Ordinal: ranking 
	3. Interval: gaps between scores have same value
	4. ratio: interval + true zero
##### **Descriptive statistics objectives - L17+18**
1. Describe why we use descriptive statistics. 
	1. To summarize and draw conclusions from data
2. Calculate and interpret a mean, median, and mode 
3. Explain how the mean is affected by outliers, and how sample size influences how much it’s affected 
4. Interpret the standard deviation 
	1. s or SD: The average **distance from the mean**
5. Describe **why** variance is calculated
	1. s^2: degree of difference between scores: **The average difference between each result**
6. Interpret a squared correlation coefficient 
	1. r^2 = shared variance, % of change in one variable that correlates with change in the other
7. Compare and contrast regression and correlation
	1. Y = a +bX
	2. Allows you to calculate the line of best fit for your data
	3. Allows you to calculate the predicted value of a criterion variable given a predictor variable value
8.  Predict a score using a regression line 
9. Define multiple correlation 
	1. The relationship between more than two variables: R, R^2 multiple correlation: **proportion of variability in criterion that is accounted for in set of predictors**
10. Describe how partial correlation helps us address the third variable problem 
	1. Essentially, mathematically factor out a variable to approximate the relationship between two variables if the third were not present
