#### Robot parable cont. 
[[PHIL351 L16 Cappelen & Denver cont. and The problem of relevance (frame problem)#The robot parable (Dennett)]]
Cannot understand the **effects** of its actions
**Cannot ignore what it knows**
Search space for real-world problems is vast → need to have a selective search strategy (heuristics and biases) to avoid 'combinatorial explosion'
Dennett's parable doesn't even raise the issue of *non-effects*

**Non-effects:** things that have not been changed do not change if something else changes (my hair color does not change when I enter a new room)

> One feels that there should be some economical and principled way of succinctly saying what changes an action makes, without having to explicitly list all the things it doesn’t change as well; yet there doesn’t seem to be another way to do it. That is the frame problem.” 
> 
> Hayes, quoted in Dietrich et al., p. 147

But, can we ignore the non-effects of an action? Aren't they sometimes relevant? 

### Historical background: the role of abduction in scientific reasoning
##### Charles Peirce 'abduction' (inference to the best explanation) 
-> Contrast with deduction and induction (narrowly understood)
- Reasoning (whether practical or theoretical, scientific, everyday) is a temporally extended process of inquiry motivated by a practical aim
Stages of abduction in reasoning: 
- Notice an anomaly, violation of expectation, obstacle to action
- Pose a question, framed in relation to one's interests
- Make an inference: hypothesize (leaps to instinctive conclusion)
- Experiment in trial and error manner
- If all goes wall, one arrives at a workable but still defeasible (defn: open in principle to revision) explanation that facilitates more fluent interaction with the world

##### Karl Popper
- Scientific method is process of conjecture and refutation (**falsification**)
- Conjecture is a creative leap of the imagination (unsupported guess-work), followed by a rigorous empirical investigation (logically derive a bold prediction, then test it via controlled experimentation)
- Fallibilism: empirical theories can never be conclusively confirmed but only disconfirmed. Science progresses through the incrememntal elimination of falsity.

##### Later: Quine, Goodman
- There is no perfect experiment to test an isolated hypothesis. We use all of our beliefs to interpret an observation
- Depending on how integrated a belief is within belief system, we may treat a false prediction as evidence against the belief in question or as evidence of measurement error
- **Moral: theory confirmation is holistic and un-codifiable**

##### Application to everyday reasoning
- The ease and speed of an inference is not an indication of its triviality
- A special case of everyday abductive reasoning: interpreting another agent's actions, including communicative intentions. We need to have the same background of relevant info in order to understand what a person says or does (see: pragmatics)
