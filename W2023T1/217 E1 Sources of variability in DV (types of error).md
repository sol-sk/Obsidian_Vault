### Sources of Variability in DV
**The Ratio:** 
	What proportion of variability in DV is attributable to IV vs "error"?
	The more random variability in DV, the harder it is to detect effect of IV

**True score theory**
> True ability + error = observed score
> Conceptual independent variable + error = score on DV

Error: both **random** and **systematic**
**More participants = less error**
**Repeated measures designs** can measure and separate systematic error
	By identifying and removing systematic error 

**Within subjects designs can detect error better with fewer participants**
