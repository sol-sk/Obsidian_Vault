### Basic definitions - Scientific Method
#### Theory
> Overarching framework that organizes and explains phenomena and data
> Generates hypotheses that test boundaries of the theory

Theories are heavily tested.

#### Hypothesis
> Tentative statement about a relationship, which may or may not be true

Guided by theories. 

#### Predictions
> Specific statement regarding the expected outcome of a study. 

#### Deduction
> If p then q

**General --> specific**
Deductive research begins with theory -> hypothesis -> predictions

#### Induction
> **Specific --> general **

Observation -> hypothesis -> theory

#### Abduction
> In absence of information, what could explain an observation? 

e.g. Diagnoses; what happened to patient? These things could be causing symptoms.. 
Essentially, guessing

**Affirming the consequent** - Not trying to create a theory
