### Systematic observation
- Observations of specific behaviors in a more controlled setting
- Coding is often introduced to categorize what is being observed

#### Strange situation (Ainsworth)
Attachment style study 
Written description of infant behavior is key to analysis of results

**→ Not typical to see full descriptions of people's individual behavior anymore (*insistence on quantitative methods*)**
- Trying to copy "hard sciences" and be more respected

#### Pigeonholing "cultural" studies (non-white participants)
→ ends up in cultural journals or being compared to white data
Study of black teens in America + technology use: qualitative, 2k participants

#### Indigenous peoples' research
- Make more use of qualitative methodologies
- Cultural practice of oral tradition → greater comfort in expressing ideas
- Talking circles as a research methodology 
	- Begins with song or prayer
	- Host sets protocols for everyone to agree to 
	- Everyone introduces themselves

**Research involving Indig. communities require relationship building + have much longer timelines**

#### Mainstream academia excludes Indigenous knowledge
- Mainstream academia's reliance on quantitative methodologies: Indigenous knowledge receives little recognition
- Many academics not trained in interpreting qualitative data
- Few Indigenous researchers (in Canada, US, Australia, NZ)
	- Not enough people producing Indigenous knowledge; what exists is ignored
- Flagship journals *never* publish purely qualitative research

### Case studies
- Common in but not exclusive to clinical psych
- defn: studying specific cases in great detail 
**Feral children**

### Archival research
- Gathering info thru archival records (statistical reports, news articles, speeches)
- Researchers use content analysis to analyze documents and records
-
