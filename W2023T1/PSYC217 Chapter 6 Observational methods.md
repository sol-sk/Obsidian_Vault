1. LO1 Compare quantitative and qualitative approaches to investigating behaviour. 
2. LO2 Describe naturalistic observation as a method and discuss related issues such as participation and concealment. 
3. LO3 Describe systematic observation as a method and discuss related issues such as the use of coding schemes, participant reactivity, equipment, reliability, and sampling. 
4. LO4 Describe the features of a case study and its appropriate uses. 
5. LO5 Describe archival research and various sources of archival data.
#### Naturalistic observation
> Researchers immerse themselves in a particular natural setting (i.e., the real world, or what is sometimes called the field)
> Observations are typically made over an extended period of time using a variety of information-collection techniques. 

- Can also involve interviewing key “informants”, talking to people about their lives, taking pictures of the environment, examining documents produced in the setting, such as newsletters, e-mails, or manuals, collect audio and video recordings
- Field researchers using naturalistic observation can also employ a fully **quantitative** approach, collecting only numerical data. 
- Qualitative data → numerical data using a *coding scheme* 

**Participant observation** → bias, but also greater depth
**Concealed observation** → less participant reactivity compared to non-concealed observation, but ethical concerns
Non-concealed observation → non-problematic, if reactivity subsides quickly 

Reactivity can be reduced by concealed observation for *both* naturalistic + systematic
#### Systematic observation 
> Careful observation of one or more specific behaviours in a particular setting.

##### Coding scheme
> Quantify qualitative observations, be they live actions, written responses, or images produced by participants.
> Can be difficult to achieve high inter-rater reliability with *live* coding, unless the coding scheme is very simple 
> Video-recording behaviour → coded later by many observers, be double-checked


### Case study
> Provides a detailed description of an individual person or a setting/community

Learning about conditions that are *rare or unusual* -->
→ unique data about what is humanly possible

*inappropriate to generalize the results from one case to the population.*

### Archival research 
> using previously compiled information to answer research questions.

**Content analysis** = systematic analysis of existing archives

### Review questions
1. Contrast the major differences between qualitative and quantitative approaches to research. Describe how a researcher taking either perspective might use naturalistic observation. 
2. What is naturalistic observation? How does a researcher collect data when conducting naturalistic observation research? 
3. Distinguish between participant observation and non-participant observation. Distinguish between concealed and non-concealed observation. Compare the pros and cons for using each kind of observation. 
4. What is systematic observation? What makes the data from systematic observation primarily quantitative?
5. What is a coding scheme? What are some important considerations when developing a coding scheme? How does it differ from a content analysis? 
6. What is a case study? Why are case studies used? 
7. What is archival research? What are the major sources of archival data? 
8. Consider all the observational techniques described in this chapter. What limitations do they have in common? What unique limitations or challenges does each have?
