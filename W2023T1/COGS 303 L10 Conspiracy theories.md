### Defining "conspiracy theory"
CT = conspiracy theory
Any theory which is not well known and includes "conspiratorial" thinking 
Often used as a pejorative
- Used to dismiss a theory as wild, implausible: this meaning appears to have been introduced by **Popper**
	- Includes Marxism 
- → Two approaches to the **definition** problem: 
	- Broad approach- separates the defn task from eval task
	- Narrow approach- conspiracy theories are bad by defn
- Two approaches to the **evaluation** problem: 
	- Particularists- conspiracy theories need to be eval on case by case basis
	- Generalists- CT in general are automatically epistemically suspect
		- Mandik: "In any choice between a CT and a declaration of 'shit happens' we are no worse off for choosing the latter"
- *Narrow* approach requires one to be a *generalist*
- *Broad* approach fits with the *particularist*

### True conspiracies 
#### Watergate
#### NSA/Edward Snowden
### Unconfirmed conspiracies
#### 9/11 was an inside job

#### Flat earth

### Defining CT: 
Dentith and Keeley: 
- There exists or existed some set of agents with a plan; 
- Steps have been taken by the agents to minimize public awareness of what they are up to; 
- Some end is/was desired by the agents
Gary suggests we add: 
- It attempts to explain an event of public concern
- The explanation conflicts with the official story 

### Bayesian framework 
Are conspiracy theories inherently unlikely? 
What should we say about the prior odds?
- Priors are also conditional probabilities
- Secrecy and collusion are ubiquitous human behavior
- **Are conspiracies rare? Are they common?**
Govt secrecy increases: prior odds increase! 

Basham's "Two families"
- Standpoint theory: how thinks look to you depends to a degree on your POV: marginalized people have different point of view 
- → Tuskegee syphilis study 
- Difference in standpoint affects the prior odds someone might reasonably assign to a conspiracy theory that resembles their background knowledge

Value of posterior odds is the product of prior odds and likelihood ratio
- Does a conspiracy theory have a low likelihood ratio? 
- Suppose the evidence we conditionalize on has the following form: the conspiracy, which (by hypothesis) has N members and has been perpetrated for interval t, has not been exposed “Exposed” here means more than just rumours. We’re talking about a leak or a whistle-blower (hard evidence) 
- Note that when E takes this form, then our denominator P(E |O) = 1 (if there is no conspiracy, then it can’t be exposed...)
