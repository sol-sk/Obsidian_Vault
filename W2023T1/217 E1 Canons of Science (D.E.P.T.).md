### Canons of Science (D.E.P.T.)
#### Determinism 
> The assumption that the universe is orderly; events occur due to meaningful and systematic cause.

Determinism is the foundation of research, and motivates all research: what are the rules of the universe? What is causally related to what?
 
#### Empiricism 
> The world can be observed and understood through structured, systematic observations.

Empiricism allows us to figure out the principles by which the universe is organized. 
#### Parsimony 
> If there are two theories which can explain the same set of empirical observations, we will give preference to the simpler; Occam's Razor. 

Parsimony requires scientists to make as few logical leaps as possible. 

#### Testability	
> Scientific theories should be empirically testable; theories should be falsifiable.

One of the most significant critiques of Freud is that his theories are unfalsifiable.
