### [[PSYC217 L3 Scientific Process#Example study Video games cause violence]]
**Study design (cont.):**
	24 hours later, participants played competitive game with "partner"
	Option to punish partner for losing: blast loser with painful white noise through headphones
		*Intensity and duration of noise = strength of blast*
**Data:**
	Calculate avg score on outcome variable ("blast strength") for each group
	Compare avgs (inferential statistics: Ch. 13, to come)
**Prediction:**
	After 24 hrs, participants who played a violent game will give a stronger blast 
**Results:**
	Statistically significant different: people who played violent games gave a stronger blast to their partners than those who played non-violent games
**Conclusions:**
	When writing a conclusion, we say "Data support, or are (in)consistent with hypotheses"
		We *do not* say confirm or (dis)prove: implies absolute certainty
		**Important to take the weight of the evidence**
			We will often see contradictory results across papers: this is normal and the nature of science
			Literature reviews seek to weigh data
	**Across the published research, do we see more evidence for or against video game 
	violence?** 

### Corbella: Vancouver's easy drug access
**Primary claim:**
	Vancouver's safe injection sites allow for easy purchase of drugs (more so than other cities)
**Supporting evidence:**
	Anecdotal, speculative
