## Interpretations of Probability
### Objective (mind-independent) Probabilities
> Frequencies
> Propensities
> Logical (Carnap's)
> Chance

### Subjective
> Classical 
> Bayesian (personalist)
> Evidential
> Degree of confidence/belief

***Does probability exist outside of mind?***

### Actual frequencies
> Probability is the proportion of actual occurrences of the event type in question 
> Probability of a kid being diagnosed with autism in BC is just the proportion of kids in BC who have been diagnosed 
> Probability it will rain based on how many times it has rained on *relevantly similar days*

#### Reference class problem
> We have to take a population from which our probabilistic event will be a proportion of 
> How do we decide on a reference class?

**Hajek** argues that the reference class problem is relevant

**Reichenbach** argues that we should use the most specific reference class for which we have information that warrants a precise valuation

> Is a narrow reference class better than a broader one? 

### Subjective probability
> **Actual degrees of belief?** 
	Actual degrees of belief do not always conform to the axioms of probability
	So, some take probability to be more of a normative constraint-how one's degrees of belief *should* be structured

**According to subjective interpretations of probability, rational degrees of belief obey axioms of probability**

### Dutch Book Argument
Better who takes advantage
"If your P(~A) â‰  1 - P(A), then a Dutch book can be made against you in which you are guaranteed to lose"

**Pragmatic: but is probabilistic coherence supposed to be the only constraint on rational belief?**

#### In summary
> **We have two broad ways of understanding what probabilities are (obj and subj)**
> **We don't often distinguish between these**
> **Both are useful**

## Decision Theory
> Study of rational decision making

#### Normative
> How a rational decision maker should proceed
#### Descriptive
> How people actually decide

We can classify decision problems by how much info agent has at time of decision: 
Certainty / Risk / Uncertainty / Ignorance

False negatives: preferred in epistemology (to false positives)
	Popper was very head-world
#### World head
False positives
