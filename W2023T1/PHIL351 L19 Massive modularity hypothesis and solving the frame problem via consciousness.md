### Lecture
[[PHIL351 L18 Fodor on the frame problem and Paradigm Shift#Enactive and ecological cognitive science]]
##### Critiques cont. 
**"Agents engage w world as objective, not just an arena for action"**
→ Whatever sense that we make of the world should be true to 'reality'

#### Massive modularity hypothesis
**Mind as a 'bag of tricks' or 'Swiss army knife'**
**No domain-general cognition**

**Content specific reasoning:** 
- We are much better at using the exact same logic if it is presented in a domain we are more familiar with (2/7/E/Z puzzle)

In his The Mind Doesn’t Work That Way (2000), Fodor argues (among other things) that the frame problem re-arises for these accounts: when a situation has features that are consistent with many different task domains, how is the relevant module selected? That is, how does the system determine what context it is in?  
• Cf. Dreyfus’ *What Computers Can’t Do*

#### Solving the frame problem via consciousness
Human cognitive architecture is peripheral and central - We have the disctinctive flexibility of central systems bc of *consciousness*

Two dominant theories of consciousness:
- Global workspace theory
- Higher order theories

##### Global workspace theory (GWT)
Humans do engage in domain general cognition (against massive modularity)

**Avoiding combinatorial explosion**
Paralell processes: global processing thru modules

'Strongest' response (because of its relevance) gets transmitted back to global workspace

Cycle of flexible cognitive processing bc result of "winning" module gets globally broadcast, processed, then result of next module, etc. 

*Globality* is explained by the integrative coordinative effects of global broadcasting (thru 'small-world' neural architecture)

*Relevance* is explained by *competitive* interactions between modules in response to the globally broadcast content

**By what process is the competition's 'winner' determined and allowed access to the global workspace?**

The standard answer invokes '**attentional mechanism**' as gatekeeper: but attention must be able to *detect relevance*. How?

##### Higher order (HO) theories of consciousness and self-modeling 
A conscious state is a mental state that one is conscious of 
- The higher order representation (meta-representation) might be a thought (HOT) or perception (HOP)
- The higher order representation might be the same as first-order representation (self-representing), or distinct 

Related: conscious states are embedded with a representation of the self within the content

Common theme: consciousness is not a mere 2-place relation between X (a representation) and Y (a represented object) but a 3-place relation between X, Y, and the subject to or for whom Y is represented via X


##### Potential relevance to the frame problem? 
Cognitive agents often fall victim to the frame problem when they fail to notice what's relevant about their situation: often bc of functional fixedness/being locked into a certain framing

Embedding a rep. of oneself/one's cog perspective on a problem within one's overall rep of the problem might afford opportunities to reflectively step back from one's cog framing to assess its appropriateness to task at hand and adjust their perspective: cog. restructuring → cog flexibility
