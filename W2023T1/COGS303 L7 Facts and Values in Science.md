### Pre class readings
[[Russell Science and Values.pdf]]
[[Douglas Inductive Risk and Values in Science.pdf]]
[[Bright DuBois Democratic Defence Of The Valuefree ideal.pdf]]
## Facts vs Values
**What is a fact?** 
- Today is Friday 
- We are in Vancouver 
- Facts must be true

**What is a value?**
- Moral permissibility
- Good vs bad

Are facts objective and values subjective?
- "I feel happy right now" - factual, subjective
- "Slavery was, is, and always will be wrong" - value judgement, objective

#### So far in this course...
We have been making value judgements regarding logic and science: evaluating
> We've been looking at epistemic values: relating to knowledge

#### Russel 
[[Russell Science and Values.pdf]]
> Great model for paper writing!

Historical shift in our understanding of science: 
- Early modern period, focus on *getting to know* the world
- Shifts to *being able to change* the world: **new goal of scientific inquiry**

Russel calls this new understanding of science **"technical philosophy"**
- Contrasts with "contemplative" philosophy ("monkish")
- At times he equates it with "pragmatism"
##### Characteristics of Technical Philosophy
- focus on what works
- scientific theories are tools that are good when they are useful
- focus on technique over metaphysics
- we need to know enough about electricity to make it work, anything more is jsut speculation
- *love of power* (context of British empire): Advocate for anti-colonialism
**--> Scientific realism**
##### Theoretical aspect (limits) of Technical Philosophy
- Limits to what we can "make true"
- We are "hemmed in by facts"
- We can end up ignoring all sorts of interesting things that are outside our sphere of influence
- We can be over-confident about our ability to make progress
##### Ethical Aspect
- science is capable of making things better or worse (these are value judgements)
- evils that science can exacerbate:
	- War
	- Tyranny
	- Climate change
	- Cyberattacks
	- (Social media) algorithms that reinforce structural injustice
- Goods: connectivity, biomedical, etc. * check slides *

We need to be deliberate about how we use the deliverances of science: what guides us? 
- Love/compassion
- Be hopeful and avoid cynicism
- Be moved by suffering and do something about it
- Honesty/intellectual honesty
- Equality
- Relevant "after the fact": affect how we *use* new technologies

#### Human and Animal Research

##### Value-Free Ideal
Normativity to internal relations: making good inferences, justification, rationality
> These are value-laden, epistemic values, which contrast with political, ethical, and social values

**Value Free Ideal (VFI)**: non-epistemic values have no role in scientific reasoning

#### Bright
##### Du Bois
> 1868-1963
> Renowned sociologist and historian

Bright elaborates on Du Bois' defense of the VFI

Claim of aims of science
> Immediate: truth seeking
> Mediate aim: providing public with info needed to make good policy decisions


- Claims immediate aim must be truth seeking, because this best facilitates the mediate aim
- The assumption here is that, if scientists allow value judgements to influence their conclusions and reporting, this would undermine public trust in their work
- Intuitive appealâ€“we see people dismissing climate science because they assume the science is guided by values they don't share

##### Tie back to democracy
- Defense of democracy: epistemic
- Decisions made by a large group of people with a broad knowledge base will be better than decisions made by a smaller group with limited knowledge

##### How idealistic is this ideal? 
- Bright notes that later Du Bois expressed some regret with respect to the VFI
	- Ideally, non-epistemic values should not affect scientific conclusions
	- In reality, we can't perfectly adhere
	- Nevertheless, it is worth striving towards

#### Douglas
Question again is whether non-epistemic values have any role with respoect to the internal relations: 
- What would it mean for these vals to play a role in the internal relations?
- I want X to be true, therefore X is true: bad arg!
- * review this slide *

**Inductive Risk: The Decision matrix**

**Significance testing: the null hypothesis**
Null hypothesis: prediction that the study will not find a correlation
p value
Statistical significance: the result of this study is mathematically unlikely if the null hypothesis were true
Threshold for statistical significance? Do we move away from p < 0.05
## REVIEW SLIDES

#### Characterizing evidence 
- uncertainty 
- inductive risk 
- value judgements: under/over regulate

Does the data in the Kociba (dioxin) study show a threshold effect?

Blurring the epistemic/non-epistemic
