## TB Learning objectives - Conducting studies
1. LO1 Describe issues to consider when manipulating independent variables. 
2. LO2 Describe and give examples of ways to measure dependent variables. 
3. LO3 Contrast floor effects and ceiling effects while discussing sensitivity of a dependent variable. 
4. LO4 Discuss what it means to “set the stage” for participants. 
5. LO5 Describe ways to control participant expectations and experimenter expectations. 
6. LO6 Summarize steps for preparing for ethical approval and running a study

#### Manipulating IV
##### straightforward manipulations 
> operationalize independent variables using instructions and stimulus presentations

##### mundane realism
> the tasks involved in a study mimic experiences and conditions present in everyday life

##### staged manipulations
> a series of events that occur during the experiment to manipulate the independent variable successfully
> used to involve the participants in an ongoing social situation, which the individuals perceive not as an experiment but as a real experience

##### experimental realism
> when the participants perceive the experiment as a real experience/engage meaningfully 

##### manipulation strength
> In general, it is a good idea to try to make the manipulation as strong as possible

##### manipulation check 
> directly measures whether the manipulation of the IV was successful
> Advantages: 
> if manip. is used in pilot study and doesn't work, you can change the procedures before running the actual experiment 
> show if the IV doesn't effect DV at all 

#### Type of measures

##### self-report measure 
> questionnaire
> can be used to measure many different aspects of human thought and behaviour, including explicit attitudes, judgments about someone’s personality characteristics, intended behaviours, emotional states, and confidence in one’s judgments

##### behavioural measure 
> direct observation of behaviours
> can measure rate, reaction time, duration

##### physiological measure 
> recording of a response of the body
> EEG, EMG, ECG, galvanic skin response (sweating; GSR), f/MRI

#### Sensitivity 
There needs to be adequate variability in DV
##### ceiling effect
> if everyone scores high → there isn’t much variability in the scores = the measure lacks sensitivity
##### floor effect
> if everyone scores low → there isn’t much variability in the scores = the measure lacks sensitivity
#### Multiple measures/multiple studies
**Cost, time, participant #**

##### demand characteristics
> any feature of a study that might inform participants of the study’s purpose and affect their behaviour

##### experimenter expectancy effects
> experimenter expectations bias/influence behavior

Solutions: 
- Run all conditions simultaneously 
- Use digital techniques
- Single/double-blinds

### Ethics
##### debriefing 
> researchers explain the ethical and educational implications of the study
> whenever any form of *deception* has been used
> whenever participants are put at *risk* in any way
> **funnelled debriefing**: determine if participants were suspicious about the deception used
