### Issues in biopsychology
Continuous vs discrete
Stable vs labile
Nature *and* nurture
	Heritability estimate = variance, not correlation
	IQ: SES, Turkheimerâ€“lower SES = more environmental impact on IQ 
	"genetic determinism"



### Neuroanatomy
#### Nervous system
Central
	Brain 
	Spinal cord 
		Neurons which extend from spinal cord outward are in both CNS and PNS
Peripheral 
	Somatic
		Afferent (sensory)
			Body -> brain
		Efferent (motor)
			Brain -> body
		External environment + interactions, mostly conscious
	Autonomic
		Internal environment, mostly non-conscious
		Efferent
			Parasympathetic
				Rest + digest: conserve energy
			Sympathetic
				mobilize energy

ANS effects aren't always generalized across the body: can be unilateral, affecting only right or left side depending on the side of the stimulus

CNS: Cell bodies cluster into gray matter in nuclei
PNS: Ganglion clusters

Bundle of axons:
	Tract (CNS)
	Nerve (PNS)
	fibers (all)

##### Anatomical dimensions (13 + 14)
Typical quadrupeds neuraxis  = post -> ant horz. 
Human = post -> ant vert. (anterior is front of face, rather than top of head): where does the turn occur? 
	between midbrain and forebrain
	Top of brain/bottom of brain are called both superior/dorsal and inferior/ventral
Superior -> inferior = dorsal -> ventral
Lateral -> medial, from line of symmetry outward


Coronal section: vertical axis between the ears
Horizontal section: what it sounds like
Midsagital slice: directly down the middle, like separating hemispheres
	Sagital: down same axis but not in perfect middle

##### Spinal cord (15)
Cervical spine: at neck: thickest parts of spinal cord
	Most info coming into/out of brain
Arrangement of white + gray matter is opposite to brain: in spinal cord, gray (cell bodies) is inner and white (axons) is outer
	Efferent = ventral of spinal cord, afferent = dorsal of spinal cord
Nerve damage in spinal cord (unlike peripheral neurons) does not regenerate
Cervical spine damage = worst, cutting off largest proportion of sensory input and output (afferent and efferent)
