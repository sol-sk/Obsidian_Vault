## Research Methods
**How do we acquire information about the world?**
#### Authority
> Weakest form of knowledge: based entirely on trust
> Often exploited, overextended
> 	Can be useful: expertise
> Dr. Spock example (against beating kids, pro sleeping babies face-down)
> Harry Frankfurt "On Bullshit"
> 	Mix of truth and lie: goal is not to deliberately mislead but to convey a certain message

#### Intuition
> Starting point in science
> Draws from life/anecdotal experience
> Sometimes correct- often wrong
> 	Illusory correlation
> 		Correlation â‰  causation, third variable, bias (prejudicial, confirmation, hindsight, post-hoc) overconfidence, intuitively bad at probability,
