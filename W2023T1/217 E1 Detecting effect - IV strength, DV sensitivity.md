##### IV Strength / DV sensitivity
> **Strong IV**: Good chance of making big change in DV
> **Weak IV**: Good at making fine distinctions in DVs, but usually can't create big effects
> **Strong DV**: Resistant to change: requires strong IV
> **Weak DV**: Both strong and weak IV will change, strong IV more likely to lead to floor or ceiling effect
> 	How do you know the strength of a variable? The existing literature


**How do we design study to maximize chances that we can:**
	Conclude that IV caused DV change?
		*Exp control, ruling out potential alternative explanations*
	Detect an effect if its there? 
		*Optimize operational definitions*
