#### Questionnaires
**In person**
- Requires easy access to particular sample
- Characteristic of most research in psych 
- Easy and cheap
- More easily control test-taking env. 

##### Mailed surveys
- More expensive than paper questionnaire
- Allows researchers to reach samples that aren't as easy to access
- Logistically more difficult, esp regarding compensation
- No control over test taking env

##### Internet-based
- Allows for massive sample size
- Extremely inexpensive
- No control over test-taking env

**With mailed and internet surveys, more noise is introduced (larger variances)**
→ Power goes down

**Questionnaires; How?**
- What may be some issues with asking participants qs about what they felt and thought previously, or why they feel a certain way?
Memories are highly suggestible, biased
- Current mood biases memories
People don't often have access to subconscious mental processes

##### On-line measures
- Take measures/record data in real time
- Done using special programs or instruments 
- **EAR = electronically activated recorder**
	- Small clip-on mic and digital sound recorder
	- At pre-set interval, records 30 sec of ambient sound

Mehl et al 
- Over 6 years, asked people to wear an EAR for about a week
- Gender stereotype that women talk more than men
- Inferetial test for this (2 groups w ratio data): t test
	- tobt = .68
	- tcrit = 1.97
	- Retain null hypothesis bc tcrit > tobt
- No reliable gender difference in how much people talk

#### Recruitment: Sampling techniques
##### Probability sampling
- Participants randomly drawn from entire pop
- Likely rep of pop
- High generalizability
##### Non-probability sampling
- Participants drawn for a specific reason
- Easy and convenient
- Low generalizability 
##### **Simple random sampling
- Everyone in a population has equal chance of being chosen

##### Cluster sampling
- If clusters exist in pop randomly sample clusters rather than individ. 
- ie. rather than vancouver, sampling a few neighborhoods (everyone in cluster is tested)

##### Stratified random sampling
- Identify subgroups w/in pop
- Identify proportion of ppl in pop belonging to subgroups
- Randomly draw samples from subgroups to reflect proportion in population

**Random assignment:**
- Every participant has equal chance of being in any experimental condition in a study → high internal validity
**Random sampling:** 
- Every person in the pop has equal chance of being chosen to participate in the study →  high external validity (generalizability)

True randomness?
