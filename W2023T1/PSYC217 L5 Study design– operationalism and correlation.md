[[217 E1 Parsimonious]]

#### **Example**
**Video games + violence: hypothetical link**
	Explanation A: Violence in video games -> aggressive behavior by children
	Explanation B: Violence in video games -> children are desensitized to violence -> aggressive behavior by children 
	*A is more parsimonious because there are fewer links in the causal chain*
	*A is more falsifiable because we don't require the additional data to falsify the intermediate link*
**Video game violence and aggression: study**
	Theory: Human behavior is a function of exposure to environmental stimuli
	Hypothesis: playing violent video games leads people to become more aggressive
	Conceptual variable #1: playing violent video games
	Conceptual variable #2: aggression
