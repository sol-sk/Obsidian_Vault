### Survey Research
> using questionnaires and interviews to ask people to provide information about themselves.

When the same people are tracked and surveyed at two or more points in time, the design is sometimes called a panel study or a longitudinal design (Chapter 11). Each period of sampling data is sometimes known as a “wave,” so a “two-wave” panel study involves surveying people at two points in time. Panel studies allow for research questions about the relationship between one variable (measured first, at “time one”) and another variable measured later (at “time two”). 

*complement to experimental research findings*

#### Response bias
A **response set** is a tendency to respond to all questions from a particular perspective, or in a particular way, rather than provide answers directly related to the questions themselves. Thus, response sets can reduce the usefulness of data obtained from self-reports.
- social desirability

#### Writing good questions
the first thing the researcher must do is determine the research objectives

##### 3 types of content
**Attitudes and Beliefs**

**Facts and Demographics**

**Behaviours**

##### Wording
**Negative Wording, Unnecessary Complexity, Double-Barrelled, Loaded**

#### Inattentive responding
> people providing answers without even really thinking about them

Soln: Conscientious Responders Scale, asking people to use a specific option in Q.
##### Nay-saying
> Agreeing with all the questions (“yea-saying”) is also known as having an acquiescence bias: a bias toward accepting the statement.

Soln: include questions with opposite meanings (so saying yes to both is unlikely)
→ Although the logic is sound, recent research on questionnaire design has demonstrated that including a few reversed items tends to decrease scale reliability  

#### Close vs. open ended
> closed-ended questions, a limited number of response alternatives are given, like with a multiple-choice question. With open-ended questions, respondents are free to answer in any way they like. 

Closed-ended questions are easier to code, by converting the response options to numerical data that can easily be analyzed
Open-ended questions are a richer source of information than closed-ended questions, because of the wide variety of responses possible. Moreover, by not limiting the respondent to a set of possible answers, open-ended questions avoid missing out on possibly useful information.

##### Closed: rating scale 
> asks people to provide judgments of “how much” for a dimension—for example, amount of agreement, liking, or confidence. Rating scales can have many different formats and use various measurement scales

fully labelled scales are more reliable than are partially labelled scales 

##### Closed: graphic rating scale
> which asks respondents to make a mark along a continuous 100 mm line, anchored with descriptions at each end

##### Closed: semantic differential scale 
> is a way to measure the meaning that people ascribe to concepts 

**Three basic dimensions:** 
- **Evaluation** (e.g., how something is valued, using adjectives such as good–bad, wise–foolish, kind–cruel). 
- **Activity** (active–passive, slow–fast, excitable–calm). 
- **Potency** (weak–strong, hard–soft, large–small).

##### Non-verbal Scale

#### Formatting the Questionnaire
- best to present only a few questions per page, rather than having one long page that people must scroll down to see all the items. 
- A progress indicator bar at the top of the screen can also help ensure completion, as long as participants perceive they are moving through the survey at a fast- enough rate. 
- Using “radio buttons,” in which people select response options that are all visible, is preferable to drop-down menus for closed-ended items. 
- Shorter questionnaires produce higher response rates than longer ones

#### Administering the survey
Questionnaire format: respondents read the questions and indicate their responses on a paper or online form. 
- questionnaires require respondents to be both motivated and attentive enough to complete them honestly.
- Mail, internet, personal administration (w/ captive audience)

Interview format: an interviewer asks the questions and records responses
- Some populations may have difficulty reading and understanding questions.
- potential problem in interviews is called interviewer bias.
	- inadvertently showing approval or disapproval of certain answers. 
	- Personal characteristics
	- leading
- Doing interviews **face-to-face** tends to be quite expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, they are most likely to be used when the sample size is fairly small and when there are clear benefits to a face-to-face interaction.
- **Telephone** interviews are less expensive than face-to-face interviews, and they allow data to be collected relatively quickly because many interviewers can work on the same survey at once.
- A **focus group** is an interview with a group of about six to ten people brought together for a period of usually two to three hours. Often the group members are selected because they have particular knowledge or interest in the topic
#### Interpreting results
##### Inferential statistics
##### Representative, large sample
→ High external validity
The **sampling frame** is the actual population of people (or clusters of people) from which a random sample will be drawn, which is often a subset of the population of interest
**response rate** in a survey is the percentage of people in the sample who actually complete the survey.

##### Getting people to respond
mailed surveys have lower response rates than Internet and telephone surveys. 
- Researchers might motivate some people to respond by highlighting the importance of the survey and that their participation will make a valuable contribution. 
- With mailed surveys, an explanatory letter can be sent a week or so prior to mailing the survey. Follow-up reminders, second mailings of the questionnaire, and including a stamped return envelope are often effective in increasing response rates. Even the look of the cover page of the questionnaire can be important (Dillman, 2000). 
With Internet surveys, 
- follow-up e-mails are critical.  
With telephone surveys, 
- people who aren’t home can be called again, 
- people who can’t be interviewed today can be scheduled for a call at a more convenient time. 
- Sometimes an incentive may be necessary to increase response rates
#### Sampling Techniques
##### probability sampling
> each member of the population has a known and specific probability of being chosen. Probability sampling allows for representative samples, allowing the results from samples to be generalized to the population from which they were drawn. 

With **simple random sampling**, 
> every member of the population has an equal probability of being selected for the sample. If the population has 1,000 members, each has one chance out of a thousand of being selected.

**stratified random sampling.** 
> In this technique, the population is divided into subgroups (or strata), and then simple random sampling is used to select sample members from each subgroup.
>  Random sampling would then be employed within each subgroup to maximize the representativeness of the sample, along the dimensions specified.

##### cluster sampling
> No list of whole population is avail
> can be used. Rather than randomly sampling from a list of people, the researcher can identify “clusters” of people and then sample from these clusters. After the clusters are chosen, all people in each cluster are included in the sample.
##### non-probability sampling
> we don’t know the probability of any particular member of the population being chosen. This has implications for the generalizability of any results based on the sample.

##### convenience sampling 
> Most prevalent
> (sometimes called haphazard sampling). In this form of non-probability sampling, participants are recruited wherever you can find them.

##### purposive sampling. 
> This refers to sampling for a specific purpose to obtain a sample of people who meet some predetermined criterion

##### quota sampling. 
> A researcher who uses this technique chooses a sample that reflects the numerical composition of various subgroups in the population. 

##### Reasons for Using Convenience Samples
Cheap and fast
important to specify to what populations we believe our samples generalize, and justify our reasons for believing this. In addition, results based on a non- representative non-probability sample might lead other researchers working with other populations to try and replicate the result
