Hence there must be some sort of manipulator to carry out those manipulations. There seem to be two basic possibilities: either the manipulator pays attention to what the symbols and rules *mean*, or it doesn't. If it does pay attention to the meanings, then it can't be entirely mechanical because meanings (whatever exactly they are) don't exert physical forces. On the other hand, if the manipulator does not pay attention to the meanings, then the manipulations can't be instances of reasoning â€“ because what's reasonable or not depends crucially on what the symbols mean. In a word, if a process or system is mechanical, it can't reason; if it reasons, it can't be mechanical. That's the paradox of mechanical reason.\"","x":1585,"y":460,"width":768,"height":358,"color":"6"},
