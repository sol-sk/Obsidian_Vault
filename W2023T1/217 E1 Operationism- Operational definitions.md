#### Operationism- Operational definitions
> Observable indicator of each variable, used for the purposes of this particular study
> Enable reliable measurement or manipulation of each variable in your hypothesis
> *How would you operationally define "aggression"?*
> May not be right or perfect, but a starting point
##### Alternative- Essentialism
> There is an unchanging, underlying essence of an entity that can be defined
> Sense of fixedness 
> Focus is on the *meaning* of words
> **Much more difficult and much less useful**


##### Operationalizing example: video game study
Study description: a group of 8th and 9th graders, who self report the games they play and their level of aggression
	Playing (exposure to) violent video games: 
		Frequency of playing favorite games x rating of a game's violence
	Aggression: 
		Self-reported hostility
		Scores on the (Cook & Medley) Hostility scale
	Prediction: 
		As one plays more violent games, the scores on the hostility scale increase
	Result:
		Score went up by 1 point (out of 10) from the completely non-violent game players to the violent game players
	Conclusion: 
		Violent video games cause aggression 
	Problems with this study: 
		Measures correlation and concludes with causality 
		Researchers "fixed" this study by changing aggression to a yes/no question about if the kids got in physical fights
