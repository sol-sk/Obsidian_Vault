### Lecture

**Brain divisions are not arbitrary: appear early in development (first month)**
#### Forebrain:
> Diencephalon
> Telencephalon (most forward)

The only brain region that is significantly, disproportionately larger than fish brain region (mid and hindbrain are relatively unchanged)

#### Midbrain
> Mesencephalon
#### Hindbrain
> Myelencephalon (medulla, most hind)
> Metencephalon

### Roadmap: 
#### Myelencephalon/Medulla: Hindbrain
![[Screen Shot 2023-10-03 at 9.40.43 AM.png]]
> Nuclei: control heartbeat, swallowing 
> Many afferent and efferent connections
> Lots of white matter + tracts

Extension of the spinal cord
Damage is often fatal 
##### Reticular activating system
![[Screen Shot 2023-10-03 at 9.42.41 AM.png]]
> Critical for wake sleep cycles, arousal, attention

Damage causes major life disturbances
Runs myelencephalon to mesencephalon
~100 nuclei 
#### Metencephalon: Hindbrain
![[Screen Shot 2023-10-03 at 9.44.51 AM.png]]
Houses retic. formation
**Pons** (tail of the fish, on the left)
>Large white matter bulge, continuing from spinal cord/medulla, many white matter connections
>Damage can be difficult to pinpoint

**Cerebellum**
> 50% of neurons
> 10% of brain volume
> Critical for motor coordination
> Damage does not prevent movement, but affects posture, gait, coordination

#### Mesencephalon: Midbrain

##### Tectum ("roof")
![[Screen Shot 2023-10-03 at 9.50.27 AM.png]]
> Comprised of two pairs of bumps (colliculi)
> Superior colliculi: vision with respect to eye movement
> Inferior colliculi: audition with respect to head/body orientation

"Boston Pizza" part of the brain 
Not within conscious access 
Damage = problem with orientation
	ie Parinaud's syndrome, problems with orienting eyes (specifically upward)
Dorsal side of midbrain = roof (hence the name, referring to the quadrupedal orientation)
##### Tegmentum ("floor")
![[Screen Shot 2023-10-03 at 9.50.37 AM.png]]
> Contains top of reticular formation
> More fibers
> Periacqueductal grey (PAG): small set of nuclei which is the main target of amygdala function (emotion and fear)
> 	Involved in *freezing, shrieking, high stress response*
> Dopamine-producing regions: **Substantia nigra** and **Ventral tegmental area (VTA)**
> 	**Substantia nigra:** Critical for eliciting movement: damage -> Parkinson's 
> 	**VTA:** Motivation, learning, addiction, potentiating motivation-related motor
> **Red nucleus:** 
> 	Bigger role in animals with smaller forebrains
> 	Species specific behaviors
> 	Schizophrenia meds can affect red nucleus, manifesting as involuntary arm jerking, mouth movements

#### Diencephalon
![[Screen Shot 2023-10-03 at 10.07.31 AM.png]]
> Begins to separate into distinct hemipherical halves
##### Thalamus
> Many nuclei: inputs from sensory systems, cerebellum, basal ganglia
> Referred to as sensory "relay center"
> 	Smell info doesn't go thru here 
> 	Also relates to attention 
> Receives almost as much *from* cortex as it *sends* 
> **Corticothalamic loops**: 
> 	There are axons that extend from cortex to the same part of thalamus *that they came from* (hence loop)
> 	Important for many aspects of *conscious experience*

Damage to thalamus: 
	Specific: Can be vision, etc. specific damage
	General thalamus damage: difficulty maintaining consciousness 
	Electric stimulation of thalamus triggers consciousness

##### Hypothalamus
> Many nuclei 
> 	Some when stimulated can start-stop eating in animal
> Diverse functions: social bonding, sex, eating, sleeping, aggression
> Key intersection with endocrine system via pituitary
> "Light switch": keeps you awake when you are supposed to be, asleep when you're supposed to be
> 

Damage to hypothalamus:
	Changes to hormonal release 
	Narcolepsy: cataplexy (full body muscle tone relaxation–all muscles go limp, can be stress response)
	"Flickering" of light switch, in and out of consciousness

Ventral/inferior side of thalamus: turn has occurred

#### Telencephalon
![[Screen Shot 2023-10-03 at 10.17.49 AM.png]]
> Cortex and underlying structures (hippocampus, basal ganglia, amygdala)
> **Cerebral cortex**
> 	Also named cortex, neocortex
> 	Largest and most prominent feature of human brain


**Highly convoluted**
> Increase total cortex volume that fits in skull
> Lissencephalic – smooth - cortices of other mammals
> 	We can genetically modify smooth brain animals to have wrinkly brains but they don't usually survive till birth 
> Gyrus: outward fold 
> 	Brain is mapped according to these because they're easy to see
> Sulcus: inward fold
> 	Fissures = landmark/extra deep sulci 
> Longitudinal fissure divides left and right hemispheres
> 	Left half of world -> right half of cortex, vice versa
> 	Why are we contralaterally organized?  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
> Hemispheres connected by a few tracts
> 	Tracts = Commissures
> 	Largest = corpus callosum 

#### **Lobes**
![[Screen Shot 2023-10-03 at 10.29.31 AM.png]]
> Named by the bones that they are beneath 
> Central fissure separates frontal and parietal lobes (not a deep sulcus, just a drawn boundry)
> **Precentral gyrus = primary motor cortex**
> 	Last step before impulse sent to muscles
> **Postcentral gyrus = primary somatosensory cortex**

![[Screen Shot 2023-10-03 at 10.32.55 AM.png]]
> Lateral fissure separates temporal from frontal/parietal is deep and easy to see
> 	If you part the folds, you can see more brain = **insular cortex**
> 		Evolutionarily older part of brain, emotion and sensory info 


##### Limbic system 
![[Screen Shot 2023-10-03 at 10.34.57 AM.png]]
> Not a system: not integrated, just a group of structures
> **Papez "circuit"**
> 	Papez was studying rabid animals, speculated it was these regions (limbic = on border) between cortex and brain stem 
> **Cingulate cortex**: not neocortex, fewer layers, surrounds corpus callosum 
> **Amygdala, hippocampus**
> 	Don't worry about the rest of the labels 
##### Basal Ganglia
![[Screen Shot 2023-10-03 at 10.37.54 AM.png]]
> **Not ganglia: nuclei**
> **Act as coordinated system**
> **Striatum (caudate + putamen) and globus pallidus**
> 	Sometimes also includes substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus, but don't worry abt these
> **Nucleus accumbens aka ventral striatum**
> 	Critical in motivated behaviors, skills, impulsivity, habits: **addiction**
> 	Home of **muscle memory**, automatic behavior


#### Anatomy of cortical layers
![[Screen Shot 2023-10-03 at 10.42.47 AM.png]]
> **6 layers in cerebral cortex**
> Somatosensory cortex: 
> 	Very thick input layer (IV) because it receives lots of information 
> Motor cortex  
> 	Very think output layer (III and V) because it's primarily sending


Even before we understood function of layers, we mapped cortical regions based on layer and cells found
	Structure relates to function: diff structure = diff function
	Brodmann areas: divisions of cortex, by cortical layers
