#### [[PSYC217 L20 Inferential Statistics#Example How to study?]]
- Outcome: More retrieval reinforces learning and leads to better outcomes
What we obtained were *mean differences*
- How likely are these differences due to chance? 

#### Non-directional hypothesis:
##### Null Hypothesis
- Mean 1 = Mean 2
- $H_0$ 
- **True effect**: study technique does not affect memory retention
- Differences are *most likely* due to random chance
##### Research Hypothesis
- Mean 1 ≠ Mean 2
- $H_1$ or $H_A$
- **True effect**: study technique affects memory retention
- Differences are *unlikely* due to random chance

$|t_{obt}| > |t_{crit}|$ = $H_1$
#### Directional hypothesis:
##### Null Hypothesis
- Mean 1 ≤ Mean 2
- $H_0$ 
- **True effect**: repeated retrieval does not lead to better memory retention than solely studying
- Mean 1 > Mean 2 in sample is *most likely* due to random chance
##### Research Hypothesis
- Mean 1 > Mean 2
- $H_1$ or $H_A$
- **True effect**: repeated retrieval leads to better memory retention than solely studying
-  Mean 1 > Mean 2 in sample is *unlikely* due to random chance

**Null hypothesis is always most parsimonious**

#### Calculating for statistical significance
1. Calculate a statistic that captures the effect
	1. eg. % (Chi square), mean difference (t or F value), correlation (r)
2. Refer to a sampling distribution for comparison
	1. What would an expected statistic value be if there was no effect (null)
3. Make a decision
	1. Is our statistic value sufficiently rare to consider it *significant*?


#### Sampling distribution
Probability distribution of any statistic of interest assuming the null hypothesis is true
What statistical result would you get from your data if the effect were only due to random chance?

#### *t*-test
> A statistical technique: is the difference between two means something expected from random chance *if the null hypothesis is true?* 
> If t-obt exceeds t-crit: null hypothesis might not be true

Can also read as ratio: $\frac{Between-group-difference}{Within-group-variability}$
- How much signal there is vs how much noise there is 

$t_{obt}$ goes up if: 
- Larger difference 
- Smaller error
