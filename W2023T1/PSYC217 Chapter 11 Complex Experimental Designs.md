1. LO1 Define a factorial design and discuss reasons why a researcher would use this design. 
2. LO2 Describe what information is provided by main effects and interaction effects in a factorial design. 
3. LO3 Interpret a graph depicting results from a 2 × 2 experimental design. Use this graph to estimate whether there is one main effect, two main effects, and/or an interaction effect. 
4. LO4 Discuss the role of simple main effects in interpreting interactions. 
5. LO5 Describe an independent variable by participant variable (IV × PV) design. 
6. LO6 Compare the assignment of participants in a between-subjects design, a within-subjects design, and a mixed factorial design.

#### Factorial design
**cell** 
> A single entry in a table, sometimes used to refer to one condition in an experiment, or to a combination of conditions in a factorial design.

A factorial design has **more than one independent variable** (also known as a factor), and with each independent variable (IV) also **having more than one level**. 
- The simplest factorial design has two independent variables, each with two levels.
	- Number of levels of first IV × Number of levels of second IV 
- For two independent variables, each with two levels, this would be described as a “2 × 2 factorial design” (read as a “two by two design”)
#### Interpreting factorial design
**Main effect**
- The effect of each IV, taken by itself
- Ignores effect of other IV
- Marginal mean: shows main effect
	- In a factorial design, the average score of all participants in one condition of one independent variable, collapsing across all other variables.
**Interaction**
- The result is dependent on both variables being present simultaneously 

**Interactions illuminate moderator variables**
- Moderator variable influences the relationship between two other variables 
**Be able to explain:**

#### Variations on 2 x 2 Factorial designs
##### Manipulated and Non-manipulated variables
IV x PV
Independent + participant variable
Investigates how different kinds of people respond to the same IV
**Not a true experiment: contains a variable which is measured and not manipulated**

#### Assignment procedures and sample size
##### Between subjects
2 x 2 design: different participants in each of the four conditions
eg. 10 participants per condition, 40 total
##### Within subjects
The same people participate in all conditions: 
##### Mixed factorial design with combined assignment
Both between and within 
Participant variable A: one group with variable A (ie. psychopathy diagnosis), one group without
	Both groups experience both levels of variable B 
10 participants per condition A: 20 total

#### Beyond two levels of IV

No main effect of anxiety
Main effect of task difficulty
Interaction present

#### Beyond two IVs
Example: Online vs face to face instruction, in small or moderate class size, first vs fourth year students
- Can be seen also as two different 2 x 2 designs, one on first and one on fourth years
- Interactions can be between variables A x B, A x C, or B x C, or A x B x C (3-way interactions are complicated, and less common than 2 way interactions)

More independent variables = more participants required, can become overly complex
