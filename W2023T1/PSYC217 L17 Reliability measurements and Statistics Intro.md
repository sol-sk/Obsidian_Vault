### Reliability

##### Test re-test reliability
- Same participants come in at time 1 and time 2 and test correlation with r to see if scores correlate

##### Inter-rater reliability
- Participant comes in, and other participants assess the individual
##### Internal consistency reliability
-  Cronbach's alpha: how well do these items relate to each other? 
	- .9 = excellent
	- Above 9, the items are so similar that the questions may as well be the same
	- .7-.9 = good
### Construct validity
##### Predictive validity
- Predicts future, conceptually related, behaviors
##### Concurrent validity
- Associated with conceptually related behaviors that are measured at the same time
##### Convergent validity
- Related to scores on measures of similar constructs
##### Discriminant validity
- Not related to scores on measures of unrelated constructs

##### **Example: intimacy survey (fear of being single)**
###### Study 1- Participants also responded to:
- Rejection sensitivity
- Hurt feeling proneness
- Breakup initiation 3 months later
- Extraversion
###### Study 2- Speed dating event
- More fear of being single was expected to correlate with less pickiness
**Study 1 results: higher fear = ...**
- Higher rejection sensitivity (convergent)
- Higher hurt feeling proneness (convergent)
- Lower breakup initiation 3 months later (predictive)
- Uncorrelated extraversion (r = -.03) (discriminant)
**Study 1 results: higher fear = ...**
- Less selectivity in choosing potential partners (concurrent)

## Statistics
#### Purpose of descriptive statistics
- Summarizes mass of data points
- Understanding and interpretation
- Visualizations + appropriate calculations
In experiments, can calculate within each cell
In correlation designs
- For each variable, calculate mean, standard deviations, etc. 
- Correlation coefficient is a descriptive statistic
#### Measures of central tendency 
> What is the *middle* of the data? What is representative?

Median = score that divides group in half
- 50% of scores above, 50% below 
Mode = most frequently occurring score
- Sometimes there is none, sometimes there are multiple
Mean = arithmetic average
- **Most used**
- Con: Can be made inaccurate by outliers
- Pros: large sample size reduces effect of outliers
- Maximizes use of datapoints
- Has mathematical properties that allow us to do analyses
