### Cellular Functions
ATP
	Adenosine tri-phosphate
	Created w oxygen + sugars
	Cells start dying within 4 minutes without oxygen

Cell membrane
	Phospholipid bilayer
	Hydrophilic/hydrophobic poles: ensures that barrier holds stuff in/out of cell: proteins allow for transfer between

Cytoskeleton
	**Kinesin**: anterograde transport & **Dynein**: retrograde transport
		Carry *proteins* up and down cell, using ATP to move
	Memory relies on fast signals and the slower transcription process

Axon
	Myelinated
	Special composition of proteins on membrane
	Axon terminal: site of neurotransmitters, pre-synaptic side 
		Synapses are fairly heterogenous (axo-secretory, axo-axonic, axo-dendritic, etc.)
		****The closer the synapse is to the axon, the stronger the chance for an action potential to occur***
		Synapses can even be directly connected to other synapses: one synapse acts like a volume nob on the other, primary synapse 

Dendrites
	Prototypically, the post-synaptic receptors
	**Dendritic spines**: bumps which cover dendrites
		**Spiny neurons**: excitatory, (generally) release glutamate (glutamaturgic)
		**Non-spiny neurons**: inhibitory, (generally) release GABA 
		*Spines can grow and shrink to strengthen and weaken connections between neurons: modify synapses*
