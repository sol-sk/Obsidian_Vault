1. LO1 Describe frequency distributions and ways to visualize them. 
2. LO2 Interpret measures of central tendency and variability. 
3. LO3 Identify ways to describe and graph relationships involving nominal variables. 
4. LO4 Identify and interpret an estimate of effect-size comparing two groups. 
5. LO5 Interpret correlation coefficients and scatterplots to describe relationships among continuous variables. 
6. LO6 Describe how regression equations and multiple correlations are used to make predictions. 
7. LO7 Discuss how a partial correlation addresses the third-variable problem.

**Scales** 
Nominal: no intrinsic numerical properties (ie. therapies)
Ordinal: lowest-highest (ie. ranking restaurants)
Interval: levels are equally apart (ie. IQ test)
Ratio: interval + true zero (ie. response time, age)
Ordinal scales averaged across many instances–such as many questions on a self report scale–take on properties similar to interval scale

Interval and ratio scales can be treated the same way statistically, group together as **continuous variables**

#### Graphing frequency distributions
- Bar graph
	- Commonly used for comparing group means, or percentages
	- Values are not continuous
- Pie chart
	- Frequently in applied research reports, infographics, newspapers
- Histogram
	- Continuous values

**Normal distribution/bell curve**
> majority of scores around mean

#### Descriptive statistics
**Central tendency**
Mean/median/mode
**Variability**
standard deviation
- variance = s^2 
- SD = s
Range 
### Describing relationships involving nominal variables
Comparing groups of participants percentages
Comparing group means
Graphing nominal data: bar or line graph

Describing effect size between two groups: **Cohen's d**
- Difference in means between two groups, in units of standard deviations![[Screen Shot 2023-11-04 at 12.26.53 PM.png]]


##### Describing relationships among continuous variables: correlating two variables

(Pearson) Correlation coefficient = r 
	r^2 = shared variance (percentage)/squared correlation coefficient

#### Regression
Can include more variables
Regression equation = linear equation
- Line of best fit 
- Y = a + bX
- Y = criterion variable
- X = predictor variable (known score)
- a = y intercept
- b = slope

**Multiple correlation + multiple regression**
- R: correlation between combined set of predictor variables + a criterion variableS
- R^2: squared multiple correlation coefficient
	- the proportion of variability in the criterion variable that is accounted for by the combined set of predictor variables
- **Multiple regression equation**: 
	- Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 +... 

#### Partial Correlation and third variable
Partial correlation: what the correlation between two variables would be if the third was held constant

#### Advanced Modeling Techniques
Structural equation modeling (SEM)
- Model(s) of relationships created and then compared with actual data set
