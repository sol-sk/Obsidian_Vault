**Measures variables**

**Correlation coefficient: `r`**
	A statistic which indexes the degree of *linear* relationship between two variables
	Also called "Pearson product-moment correlation"
	-1>r>1
**Correlation coefficient is *very poor* for measuring curvilinear relationships; a perfect curve would have an `r` value of 0** 

#### **Third variable problem**
> Correlation between A and B is byproduct of *influence* by external variable C
> 	More common in correlational study design 
#### **Bi-directionality problem**
> Not knowing which direction causality goes (does A cause B or B cause A)?

### Internal validity
> The ability to infer that one variable causes changes in another variable
> 	Covariation in two variables
> 	Temporal precedence (if A causes B, then A must happen before B)
> 	Eliminate plausible alternative explanations
> 		Can difference in outcome be attributed *only* to changes in some other variable?
