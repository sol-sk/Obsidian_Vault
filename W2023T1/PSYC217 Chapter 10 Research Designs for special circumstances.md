1. LO1 Describe the purpose of program evaluation research and five types of questions that program evaluations can seek to address. 
2. LO2 Compare and contrast the one-group posttest-only design with the one- group pretest-posttest design. 
3. LO3 Describe threats to internal validity for quasi-experimental designs. 
4. LO4 Discuss the advantages of having a non-equivalent control group, and compare and contrast the non-equivalent control group design with the non- equivalent control group pretest-posttest design.
5. LO5 Distinguish between the interrupted time series design and control series design. 
6. LO6 Describe single case experimental designs and discuss reasons to use these designs.
7. LO7 Compare cross-sectional, longitudinal, and sequential research designs, including the advantages and disadvantages of each design

#### Program evaluation
- Evaluation of need: what problems need to be addressed
- Program theory: using valid assumptions about the causes of the problems and rationale for addressing them 
- Outcome evaluation/impact assessment: are the intended outcomes of the program being realized? 
- Efficiency assessment: are the benefits worth the program's cost? 

### Quasi experimental designs

- One-group posttest-only 
- One-group pretest-posttest 
- Non-equivalent control group 
- Non-equivalent control group pretest-posttest 
- Interrupted time series 
- Control series
##### One group posttest only 
- No control group
- Weak evidence but sometimes is the only design possible

##### One group pretest posttest
- Can be weak to alternative explanations: threats to (internal) validity
- Should still only be used if true experiment is not possible
- Can help us identify problems with true experiment

#### Threats to internal validity
Internal validity: ability to claim that the IV caused changes in DV
- Quasi-experiments have weak internal validity
	- Common threats: history, maturation, testing, instrument decay, regression toward the mean, attrition, selection effects, cohort effects

##### Non-equivalent control group design
Example: smokers vs non smokers, relaxation training
Or: self selected smokers vs smokers who don't opt in

##### Non-equivalent control group pretest-posttest design
one of the most useful quasi-experiments

##### Interrupted time series design
Examines data before and after manipulation, ie. passing a traffic law

##### Control series design
Interrupted time + control group

### Single case experimental designs
**Single participant**
- Participant's behavior is measured during baseline control period
- Manipulation is introduced during a treatment period
- Change in participants behavior between baseline and treatment period: evidence for effectiveness of manipulation

BF Skinner


#### Reversal designs
Demonstrates that the effect of treatment period can be undone by returning to baseline: 
**ABA design**
##### Multiple baseline design
- **Across participants:** manipulation introduced at *different points in time*
- **Across behaviors**: several different behaviors of a *single* participant are measured over time. At different times, an intervention is introduced to target *each of these behaviors.*
- **Across situations**

#### Replications in single case designs
Questionable generalizability, although multiple participants can strengthen 

### Developmental research designs
Cross sectional
- Similar to between subjects
Longitudinal 
- Similar to within subjects
Cross sectional more common because less expensive and faster
- However: more potential confounds: **cohort effects**

**Sequential method**
- blends both 
- Fewer years, and cross sectional data can be analyzed while longitudinal are still being collected
