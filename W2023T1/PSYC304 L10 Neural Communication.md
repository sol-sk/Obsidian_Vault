Healthy neuron has a resting membrane potential of between -60 and -80 mV (compared to outside of the cell)

Potential energy is measured in voltage

We were first able to measure energy in invertebrates: **squid giant axon**
	Squids have very large axons; 1mm, an electrode can be inserted with relative accuracy

#### Chemical aspect of Neuronal communication
**Sodium + potassium**
	$Na^{+}K^{+}$
	Movement of ions into and our of cells changes *potential/voltage* at membrane
	Absence of pos is neg; more ions on outside = neg inside
**Chemical gradients**
	*Force* which pushes on ions
		High concentration -> low concentration to equalize concentration
**Electrical gradients**
	Wants to equalize at 0mV
**Cell membrane**
	Tightly packed, both hydrophobic and hydrophilic
	Channels: allow passive diffusion along chemical gradient
	Pumps: push against chemical gradient
		require atp 
**Sodium potassium pump**
	Consumes 2/3 of all neuronal energy
	Embedded in cell membrane 
	Pushes 3 Na out of cell, 2 K into cell
	Sodium wants to flow in, Potassium wants to flow out, more positive outside, negative inside
**Potassium "leak" channels**
	K can move freely via these channels that are *always open*
	Na cannot move freely across membrane
		Channels are usually closed 
	Potassium wants to flow out because of chemical gradient, but electrical gradient gets more negative on inside of cell
		Chemical tries to push out, electrical tries to push in 
		This is why the equilibrium is electrically negative
