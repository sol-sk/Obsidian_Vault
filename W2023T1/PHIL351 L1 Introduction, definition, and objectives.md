### Pre-class Readings
**Cain, Chapter 1, §§1-3 
[[The Philosophy of Cognitive Science (Cain, Mark J) (Z-Library).pdf]]
	Commonsense defn of cognition (that which separates humans from inanimate): 
		thought, perception thru senses, sensation/pain, emotion, mood, meta-cognition, acting on intention, etc. 
	 ***Thinking***
		 mental process which issues in a thought, banal, complex, hypothetical, abstruse
		 *Extended in time* - each step of thinking process is chronologically related to the previous (happens before or after, step by step)
	Thought
		mental state of considering hypothesis/answer, or committed to hypothesis/answer -> *beliefs*
		Thought = **Propositional attitudes**
			attitude towards proposition 'p'
			includes belief, desires, intentions, hopes, fears, expectations, etc.
	Propositional attitudes have **semantic properties**
		Declarative sentence = a propositional attitude represented in natural language
		"Content" = meaning, or semantic property, of a propositional attitude
		Sentences' meaning is a product of the words and the arrangement of those words / Propositional attitudes' meaning is a product of constituent concepts and their arrangement 
	**Perceptual Experiences**
		Are representational in the same respect that a propositional attitude is representational: therefore, are **cognitive**
		In contrast to thinking, we do not experience the process which leads to our perceptual experience
			These processes are unconscious
		Interfaces with propositional attitudes: we update prop. att. based on percept. exp. and we act accordingly
	∴ Cognitive science should be concerned with perception and action as well as thinking
	***Science and cognition***
		Can we even study our own cognition?
			Counterargs: Dualism, Chomsky's "problems vs mysteries" (that which we have no hope of answering), commonsense answers may not be scientifically traceable
	Chomsky: utterances and meaning
		Successful communication requires understanding communicative intentions
			We must draw on information which is not specifically linguistic; body language, history of interaction, tone, etc. 
		∴ Because understanding communicative intentions relies on a wide variety of non-linguistic information, we cannot explain how we understand communicative intentions

### Lecture

##### **What is this course about?**

2 distinct philosophical projects
	**The foundations: debates about the theoretical foundations for a science of mind**
		Basic explanatory principles and constructs
		Can be more focused on concrete / theoretical 
	**The reconciliation project: debates about how (or if) a scientific perspective on the mind can be reconciled with our non-scientific ('common sense') perspectives on the mind**
		integrating 'scientific' and 'manifest' image of ourselves
		also called the "imperfect problem"
		distinctive project to cognitive research 
			e.g. in study of physics, the naive perspective is discarded once the science is learned; common sense is even counterproductive
		Eliminative materialists: we should discard 'common sense' perspectives solely in favor of scientific construction (not the most popular perspective)
	These projects may well not be independent of each other. 

A third philosophical project is rapidly emerging: 
	ensuring that the cognitive systems (AI) we build are built *ethically*

These 3 projects–**foundations, reconciliation, and ethical AI**–will be the main topics of the course. 

#### **What is cognitive science?**
The theoretical integrated interdisciplinary study of mind
At its core: the understanding of cognition as *computation/information processing*

##### Pre-history of cognitive science
17th century: scientific revolution
Teleology - The idea that things are being driven towards their {innate} goal 
Explanation of phenomena thru general principles
Newton
-> Replacement of teleology with external forces 
-> Representation of geometric relationships with algebra 
Mechanical artefacts: complex wholes can be analyzed into a set of interacting components, then formalized
	Construction of animal automata -> development of 'clockwork' models of living systems + the physical universe

**Hobbes**
	Reason: how do we think of scientific reasoning?
	'Reason is nothing but Reckoning (that is Adding and Subtracting) of the Consequences of general names agreed upon, for the marking and signifying of our thoughts, I say marking them, when we reckon by our selves, ...' (from slides)
	'By ratiocination, I mean *computation*'
		**All thinking is calculation**

**La Mettrie**
	Humans are wholly accounted for mechanically/materially: "man is a machine"
		**Can be explained**
