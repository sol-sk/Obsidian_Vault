### Lecture: Hypothalamus + Neuroendocrine cells
Slides 8-21
**Hypothalamus = main junction between brain and endocrine**
##### Neuroendocrine cells
- Have APs = neuron
- Secrete into bloodstream = hormone
- → Some hormones are also neurotransmitters! Neuroendocrine
- In Hypothalamus (HTh)
#### Hormone types: 

**Peptide**
- Large
**Amine**
- Can also have intracellular effects
**Steroid**
- Look like cholesterol 
- Fatty, non-polar → can cross plasma membrane

#### Hormone receptor types
**At the membrane**
- GPCRs
- Faster
**Intracellular** (steroids, altho they can also have GPCRs)
- Near nucleus; transcription factor
- Slower

### Hormones in behavior
Activational effects in animals but effects harder to connect 1:1 in humans
- Cortex often supersedes older controls for behavior
- Psychosocial dwarfism

#### Oxytocin
Levels track with amount of revenge: not just love chemical, also increases in-group bias and revenge against outgroups

#### Pheromones
Non-human animals: vomeronasal organ (VNO)
- Slightly separate from nasal cavity 
- Has diff receptors and pathways to detect pheromones
- Blocking VNO signals = blocking pheromone signal
Humans don't really have VNO or related genes/receptors (we do have the remnants but they're not functional)
- Menstrual synchronization; pheromonal? but this study does not *replicate* well
- Dude sweat - MHC (major histocompatibility complex): improves immune system of offspring for parents to have very diff (complementary) MHC
	- Women preferred the smell of men with complementary immune systems
	- Not certain

#### Stress hormones 
All animals, including humans, are affected behaviorally by stress hormones
**Dual pathways**
- Slow vs fast 
- HPA axis
- Sympathetic NS

**Highly interpretive**
- Giving people adrenaline and putting them in diff situations; gets interpreted as stress/excitement depending on the emotion of a confederate 

Skipping slides 28-32 & 36

#### Androgens and estrogens
Non-human animals: yes
Humans: somewhat
- Difficult to spot; 
- Menstrual cycle, natural (slight) testosterone cycle
	- People more likely to initiate sex during ovulation
Men's sexual interest only requires about 10% of standard testosterone level
Testosterone levels track aggression in animals, vicarious victory in men (in sports or political elections)

Gendered behaviors are present, but differentiating social and biological influences is difficult

Observable differences in cognitive abilities: diminishing
Men tend to be better with spatial reasoning, paper folding, darts throwing
Women tend to be better with spotting differences, fine motor skills

### Vision
#### Lecture 10 Learning objectives
1. What does it mean to say, “The brain is not a hard drive, and the eye is not a camera”? i.e. What does it mean to say that perception is active? 
2. Describe numerous examples of active perceptual processing, both in this lecture and the previous. 
3. Describe parallel processing and its relation to the visual system. 
4. Describe separate systems for processing visual information in the retina. 
	1. Pathways: mainly peripheral, rods, lower light vs daytime, cones, central 
5. Describe a receptive field, and how it varies across the visual system. 
6. Describe separate pathways for visual information from retina to thalamus to cortex. 
7. What two theories describe colour vision? Are they mutually exclusive or complementary? Do they completely describe colour perception? Describe the putative neural mechanisms for each theory, and what else might account for our perception of colour. 
8. How does the visual cortex turn basic light stimulus into perceptions? 
9. Describe separate pathways for processing information in the cortex. What do these suggest about discrete damage to visual areas?

#### DARPA Grand Challenge (2004)
240 km race btwn self-driving cars
- Visual systems incredibly difficult to model in computers: one car couldn't figure out if shadow was concave hole or convex rock and it just stopped and gave up 

#### Visible light spectrum
Visual light is useful to us, other rays aren't (for us)
Wavelengths detectable vary by species

#### Adaptation
*Consequence of constant stimulation*
Absolute values <<< Changes in dynamics and contrast
- If you stare at an object in a dark room without moving the object will start to disappear (eyes ignore constant stimuli)
Explains why we usually don't see the blood vessels in our eyes (might see them when using a microscope and light reflects)
Constant eye movement - **saccades** - prevent world from fading

#### Eye parts
Cornea: hard lens
Lens: soft lens, can stretch/relax to change angle (cillary muscles)
Retina: back of eye, contains photoreceptors
Choroid: where retina gets pigment from

Octopus have much better designed eyes than us 
- Axons and blood vessels *behind* photoreceptors
- No blind spot

#### Myopia 
The cornea and lens focus images onto retina
![[Screen Shot 2023-11-28 at 10.30.58 AM.png]]

Myopia; "football shaped" eyeball (eye is elongated)
- Light converges before it hits retina, so it's scattered by the time it reaches retina

#### Layer structure of vision
**Nissl stain**
![[Screen Shot 2023-11-28 at 10.32.52 AM.png]]
- everything in front of photoreceptors is translucent: prevent scattering as light travels
- 130 mil photoreceptors per eye
![[Screen Shot 2023-11-28 at 10.34.14 AM.png]]
- Rods and cones → bipolar cells → retinal ganglion cells (main output)
- Horizontal cells (H) + amacrine cells (A) span horz. 


Note: Graded potentials, rather than action potentials
- Axon-like, but very short: releases more or less neurotransmitter depending on signal, rather than on/off electrical impulse
- *Retinal ganglion cells do release APs*

#### Rods and Cones
![[Screen Shot 2023-11-28 at 10.37.50 AM.png]]
**Rods**
- Scotopic, highly sensitive to light, great in low light
- Rods are bigger

**Cones**
- Photopic, less sensitive to light, great in daytime 

Note: 
- Default state, w/o stim, is releasing glutamate. When light shines → hyperpolarized → *stop* producing glutamate
- **Inverted signal**
- Our photoreceptors are GPCRs; metabotropic (ish) – vision uses *slow version of receptors*
	- Prob not advantageous but it's just how it worked out

#### Function influences location
Center of visual field, most acute = fovea
	Some animals have multiple per eye
Cones highly concentrated in **center** of visual field (visual angle of 0º)
Rods most concentrated at ~15º visual angle, slowly tapering from there, and **none** at center

	Patch w/ no rods or cones = blind spot
