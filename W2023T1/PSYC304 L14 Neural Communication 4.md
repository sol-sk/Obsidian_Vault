### Norepinephrine
 - Originates in brain stem region called the locus coeruleus 
 - Causes heterosynaptic facilitation (via heteroceptors) 
 - Enhancement of memory by stress/emotion 
- Faster response times, higher attentiveness 
- Evolutionarily useful
Dysfunctional: PTSD
- Propranolol: beta (norep. receptor) blocker for heart medication
	- Therapists have had patients revisit trauma while on these meds to reduce their impact, but some ethical problems...
	- Started using post-breakup negative memories instead: propranolol therapy did reduce the negative impact of memory of ex/breakup
- Memories are consolidated into working memory, in **labile state**
	- Fragile, can be distorted
- Reconsolidation: every time we revisit a memory we can put it in this labile state

### Serotonin
- Primarily from the raphe nuclei (brain stem) 
	- raphe = "seam" 
- **Diffused across much of the brain at once, less localized**
- Precursor: tryptophan (comes from diet, ie. turkey)
	- Carbohydrates act as transporters of tryptophan into brain
	- Diets can show that low carb diets can decrease serotonin levels
- Serotonin depletion
	- Performance on Stroop task (cognitive flexibility task) is worse with less serotonin
	- Low serotonin = more aggressive (same video game punishment as 217), more impulsive, irritable, but mood doesn't appear to change
	- Study on two groups: family history of depression / no family history of depression
		- Low serotonin does appear to impact mood in those with family history of depression
#### Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors 
- aka SSRIs, e.g. Prozac (fluoxetine) 
- For depression 
- Block serotonin from being removed from the synapse: **targets serotonin transporter**
	- Serotonin is cleaned up slower, has greater effect
- Effects of SSRIs quick, improvements slow

Maybe SSRIs help, or maybe regression to the mean (depression alleviated itself)
- Meta analyses: SSRIs no better than placebo for mild to moderate depression 
- May help?
- 70% of Doctors said that they would prescribe SSRIs to (list of depression symptoms), but only 40% of doctors said they would *take* SSRIs if they were experiencing that same list of symptoms

### Hallucinogens
- Psychedelics are serotonin receptor agonists
- Radical changes to our conscious perception and thoughts, minimal effects on mood (implication?)
	- Pattern recognition
	- Mood heavily impacts trip
	- 1/3 of participants on mushrooms reported one of the most spiritually enlightening experiences
	- 1/3 (overlapping) of participants on shrooms reported one of the most anxiety provoking experiences 
- Recent reexamination of psychedelics therapeutic value
	- End of life care, PTSD, addiction

#### Acetylcholine
- Neuromuscular junciton 
	- Presynaptic: axon terminal 
	- postsynaptic: muscle
- Basal forebrain 
	- Wakefulness attention etc
- Nicotine/nicotinic receptor = acetylcholine receptor
	- Unhelpfully named after nicotine bc it goes to these (causes nic sickness)

#### Endocannabinoids
Also named after the drug it interacts with 
- Two NTs, two receptors (GPCRs)
- THC + CBD = psychoactive effects, found the molecules in system that had similar effects 
	- Artificially activate endocannabinoid receptors
- These neurotransmitters are very good at crossing membranes; not well stored in vesicles because they escape
	- Made on demand **in dendrites** bc they don't store well
- Retrograde transmission: dendrite to axon
- Metabotropic
- Receptors, when activated, *weaken* synapse: forgetting
	- Brain needs to block non valuable info: this is function of this system

#### Adenosine
- Adenosine is ATP byproduct
- Adenosine receptors across whole body + whole brain
	- All metabotropic, tends to be inhibitory: daytime sleepiness result of adenosine buildup
- Caffeine/theophylline
	- Theophylline = tea
	- Adenosine receptor antagonists
- Caffeine is only effective every once in a while: competition between tolerance and coffee-drinking habits (more coffee..)
	- Caffeine withdrawal lasts around 2-3 weeks
	- Adenosine receptors recover
	- Habitual caffeine drinkers wake up in caffeine withdrawal 
- Caffeine intoxication: adenosine receptors all over body 
Coffee (and nicotine!) is neuroprotective!

#### Endogenous opiods
- for the third time, named after the drugs
- Endorphine = endogenous morphine
- Giant peptide neurotransmitters
- G-protein coupled
- Receptors in periacqueductal grey (PAG), nucleus accumbens, and more: All the way down to spinal chord: *pain relief from neurotransmitter release*
- Neurotransmitter system that exogenous opioids like heroin mimic
- Highly addictive: fentanyl 
	- Naloxone: opioid antagonist
- Receptors are all GPCRs
