### Philosophy of Science 
Science raises philosophical questions: 
> Metaphysics – do theoretical entities actually exist?
> Ethics – what human/animal experimentation is ethical?
> Epistemology – how do we confirm a theory and assess its strength? (largest focus)

#### Guiding questions
Are there better and worse ways of doing science? 
What makes for good science? 
What is the standard by which to judge science? 
Is 'trust the science' a good motto to live by? 
Within articles: does the article make a strong case for its conclusion?

#### Answering these questions: What makes science work? 
> Critical analysis of science, aka. Philosophy of science

#### Scientific method
> "There is no scientific method. There are only scientific methods. And each of these is fragile; replaceable, in- deed destined for replacement; contested from decade to decade, from discipline to discipline, even from lab to lab."
 –Otto Neurath

How does the scientific method change?
	Introduction of new tools (e.g. the telescope), new theories (e.g. gravity), new concerns (e.g. ethics)

#### Epistemology
> The philosophical analysis of knowledge
> The means by which we develop/evaluate scientific methods

Foundational questions: 
	Is knowledge possible?
	What are the conditions that are sufficient for knowing something? Is it the same as a "justified, true belief"
	Under what conditions are sentences of the for "S knows that P true"

**What is the logic that justifies scientific inference?**
and... 
**What do we mean by "justify"?**

Justification is a normative concept: seeks to preserve that which is *morally good*
