[[PSYC304 Lecture 09 - Somatosensation.pdf]]
### Learning objectives 
1. Differentiate sensation and perception. 
2. Differentiate top-down from bottom-up sensory processes. 
3. Do we have five senses? Justify your answer with evidence at the cellular level. 
4. How do we determine whether incoming neural information reflects vision, or sound, or touch, etc.? What would happen if we wired the auditory neurons to the visual system, and vice versa? 
5. Define the four main types of somatosensory receptors in sensory cells. How do they transduce the external energy into a neural signal? How is their information carried to the brain, including their axons and the pathways? 
6. How does the brain code for intensity of a stimulus? 
7. Why does our sensation diminish with constant stimulation? Why would this be a good thing? 
8. Understand the concepts of a receptive field as well as centre-surround organization. 
9. How does the brain organize sensory information? 
10. What does it mean that the brain is plastic? How does this relate to damage or experience? 
11. In biological terms, what is attention? 
12. Why experience pain? Why not simply have the negative stimulus alter our behaviour? 
13. Define some different types of nociceptors and thermoceptors, including the receptor types and pathways into the brain. 
14. Describe some ways that pain can be managed, including their potential drawbacks.

#### Sensation vs Perception
- Sensing = detected by nervous system
- Perception = conscious detection (organize and interpret; gestalt)

##### Bottom up processing
Info is detected by **receptors** → info goes into brain → info is organized → info is **perceived**/understood

##### Top down processing
Formulate perceptual hypothesis; expectation of what you will perceive, existing mental model of world → search for stimuli that fit this construct → understand stimulus based on this construct

##### Transduction
Conversion of external energy into nervous system signals 

**Specialized receptors**: proteins 
- Hair cells (auditory receptors): potassium flows in 
- **Receptor potentials** on receiving side 
	- Very similar to PSPs, but.. 
	- *Activated by external energies*
- Often ionotropic, can also be metabotropic (visual receptors, although they work weird)
- Often don't have axons, but release neurotransmitters 

Limitations present in vertebrate eyes are result of evolution; changes happen to pre-existing systems, working with best that we have but can only build on what already exists
- Octopus eye is better designed than ours!

Restricted range; depending on species needs (cats hear higher, elephants hear lower)

How does brain decode action potentials into separate senses?
- Doctrine of specific nerve energies
	- Touch and pain are transmitted to brain separately but are similar, travel near each other
- Crossed wires: synesthesia?
- Concept of labelled lines
- Cortex will make sense of whatever info it is given (even if wires get crossed)


Receptor potentials and APs: **Threshold of excitation**
![[Screen Shot 2023-12-04 at 5.49.00 PM.png]]
- Similar to neuron → neuron communication
#### Principles of sensation
##### Intensity Coding: cells with differing thresholds
We have a high degree of sensitivity; requires specialized technology 
Multiple neurons act in parallel 
Different neurons are specialized for different levels of sensitivity: **Range fractionation**
- Low threshold neurons fire for only weak stimuli (weaker = fewer neurons fire), top out at medium stimulus → medium threshold fire, plateau → then high threshold start firing

##### Sensory Adaptation
- **Adaptation:** progressive loss of response to maintained stimulus
	- Why have adaptation: constantly receiving the same stimulus is overstimulating and not useful 
	- Tonic: slow-adapting to constant stimulus
	- Phasic: fast-adapting to constant stimulus
- Can resensitize with new stimulus

##### Receptive fields
Each neuron fires regionally specifically 
- Strength of cell firing depends on how close stimulus is to middle of receptive field
- Center surround organization
	- Touching in periphery will decrease sensitivity in center 
	- **Enhances contrast**

### Four main skin receptors
![[Screen Shot 2023-12-04 at 5.44.24 PM.png]]
##### Pacinian Corpuscle
- Detect vibration; deep in skin 
- Graded potentials; look a lot like PSPs
- With enough graded potentials; AP occurs
- No dendrites, just corpuscle with receptors
- Cluster of cell bodies in the **dorsal root ganglion**
	- "pseudounipolar" neurons
- Transduction via stretch receptors
	- Sodium flows into cell when stretches open 
	- Similar receptors in muscles (for proprioception; muscle spindles), ears

All of this info should be reviewed:
![[Screen Shot 2023-12-04 at 6.00.36 PM.png]]

#### Afferent axons from skin receptors
![[Screen Shot 2023-12-04 at 6.03.41 PM.png]]
#### Spinal cord
Touch axons: travel up spinal cord in dorsal column and goes to medulla, where the first synapse usually* occurs
- **Medulla is where touch info crosses contralaterally** (from right to left and vice versa)
- Travels to **thalamus**
![[Screen Shot 2023-12-04 at 6.11.51 PM.png]]
##### Dermatomes
- Related to diff dorsal roots
- Overlap with adjacent dermatomes
![[Screen Shot 2023-12-04 at 6.12.13 PM.png]]

#### Sensory pathways
- **Segregated pathways** (auditory separate from somatosensory etc. )
- Arrive via nerves to spinal cord or brain stem
- Most (not all: olfaction is the exception) pass thru thalamus
- Terminate in the cerebral cortex

##### Cortical organization of sensory info
Primary somatosensory cortex (S1) → (via thalamus) secondary → tertiary cortexes
- Contralateral organization
- Somatotopic organization: representing the body itself (see: Homunculus)
- Basic sensation, patterns
Secondary somatosensory cortex (S2)
- More sophisticated processing
- Complex patterns, representations can be bilateral (more prevalent in motor system)
- Much smaller
Just behind central fissure: most anterior portion of parietal lobe

#### Somatotopic organization
- Fine sensation in hands: evolutionary relevance
	- Much less sensitivity on back: can't even tell how many points we are being touched on back lol 
	- Higher density of cells, (because) more actively being used
- **Corical magnification**: disprop. representation of important areas

#### Special systems for special animals: Rat whiskers
Whiskers are for whisking! Detect closeness to edge (avoid open spaces), if they can fit in a hole
Much larger cortical magnification in **barrel cortex**, where whiskers transmit info to

##### Cortical magnification is based on use: can change → Receptive fields get larger, are flexible
- If you lose your middle finger, the part of the cortex that it mapped to will reduce to nothing → index and ring finger regions will become larger 
![[Screen Shot 2023-12-04 at 6.24.46 PM.png]]

##### Can increase due to use: If you use your index and middle finger more for relevant information, they'll get bigger
- Happens in musicians, etc. 

##### Neuroplasticity due to cortical damage
- Nearby cells will take up duties of damaged cells
- Constraint-induced therapy: need to use relevant part of cortex *a lot*: use the "bad" hand
##### Phantom limbs: a case of large-scale plasticity
- Regions with nothing to do (eg. due to limb loss) will start interpreting other signals as stim to lost limb 

Limitation of neuroplasticity: we need to store memory, etc., systems to function reliably the same

##### Cortical sensory neuron specialization
- Cortices are organized slightly differently (so somewhat specialized at that level), but **wiring** seems to be essential to sensation
- If the visual cortex was fed only with auditory information, it would *become* an auditory cortex
	- Changing destination of wiring in animals (swapping A1 and V1): they can still hear and see
- Apply direct current stimulations
- Putting parts of rat brain into robot: can integrate visual inputs and avoid walls

#### Attention
- Changing how sensory systems process info
- Top down processes
- Attended message (sensory input) is amplified to memory
	- eg. listening to conversation
- All info reaches brain but some gets extra processing and priority, not all gets committed to memory
- Posterior parietal cortex guides attention
	- Also: cingulate cortex

#### Tertiary/"Association" cortex
**Perception**
- Multimodal
- Comprises much of the brain 
- Is it truly "sensory" or "motor"? 
- Integration of body with env., memory and perception, perception and consciousness
![[Screen Shot 2023-12-05 at 9.29.42 AM.png]]

#### Synesthesia: Cross-modal stimulation
- Grapheme-color synesthesia (within vision, seeing numbers or letters as colors)
- Doesn't seem to be developed as a result of specific memories
	- Related to learning rules; eg. red is most common color, a is most common letter → a = red, b is first letter of blue → a = blue
- Evolutionary basis?
- Wolfgang Kohler: Bouba vs Kiki
	- 90%+ of people across cultures think that kiki is sharp and bouba is round

##### How to test if synesthesia is real
2/5 search: if you can see color the 2s pop out much more easily → synesthetes could, in fact, find them faster

### Pain 
*Unpleasant experience associated with tissue damage*
Form of somatosensation but has specific receptors; **free nerve endings**
Congenital insensitivity to pain: a voltage gated sodium channel mutation
- Tends to cause a significant number of injuries throughout life → pain keeps us alive
More than just removing body from source of pain: experience of pain is not necessary for this reflex
- We withdraw finger from fire reflexively
- Recuperation (letting injury heal)
- Learning → avoid injury
- Signal to others → other people can see your pain response and avoid doing it

#### Multifaceted:
**Pain perception**; McGill pain questionnaire
- Cognitive system (no pain, mild, excruciating)
- Motivational affective system (tiring, fearful)
- Sensory discriminative system (throbbing, shooting)

#### Nociceptors: Pain, temperature, itch
- Receive pain 
- Same category as thermoception (free nerve endings)
#### Thermoceptors
- TRPV1: C fibers 
	- C fibers: small, unmyelinated axons to spinal cord
	- Binds to capsaicin!
	- Ion channel
	- Sensitive to temperatures above physiological functioning 
- TRPM3: Aδ fibers
	- Faster than TRPV1
	- Detects very high levels of heat
	- Aδ fibers: myelinated axons to spinal cord
- CMR1: C fibers
	- Binds to methanol!
	- Detects cool temperatures

#### Itch
- Some itch cells have histamine receptors
- All have TRPV1
- Natriuretic polypeptide B (NPPB)
	- Large peptide neurotrans
	- Seems to be easy differentiation between temperature and itch cells
- Variety of mechanisms

#### Spinothalamic systems
APs travel via C or A fibers to **anterolateral system**
Synapses immediately in dorsal horn → crosses midline **in spinal cord** → travels to **thalamus** → projects to S1, insula, *cingulate cortex*
- Compare to touch which crosses much later in medulla

##### Phantom limb pain 
- aka **Neuropathic pain**
- After loss of hand, most of dorsal horn neuron is *still there*: can still send signals, may be hypersensitive
	- Gets interpreted by brain as pain

#### Pain isn't just physical 
- Social rejection activates **cingulate cortex**
- Painkillers can lessen the pain of social rejection
- Existential pain??

#### Pain management
- Psychogenic
	- Placebo, cognitive, hypnosis
- Pharmacological 
	- Cannabinoids: reduce inflammation
	- opiates, NSAIDS
- Stimulation
	- Acupuncture
- Surgical

##### Drugs
Analgesia
- the absence or reduction of pain
NSAIDS
- Reduces production of inflammatory prostaglandins
Opioids
- Mimic endogenous opioids for analgesia
- Act at spinal cord, descending pathways, higher brain sites

##### Periaqueductal Gray (PAG)
- Also in tegmentum 
- Opioid release →  down to raphe nucleus 
	- Releases endogenous effects
- Release end. op. → serotonin release → activates interneuron *in spinal cord* which also produces endogenous opioids 
- Stimulate PAG: profound pain relief 
**Gate theory of pain**: block signal from *coming in*
- Exogenous opioids mimic both raphe and spinal cord 

##### Placebo
- Strong effects in pain
- Weak/no effects in other modalities
- Vary according to our expectations: 1 pill is less effective than 2, less effective than injection
- Mediated by endogenous opioids
	- NAcc has lots of endopiod receptors
- More response to placebo → more response in NAcc (but this could just be general *reinforcement* reaction)
