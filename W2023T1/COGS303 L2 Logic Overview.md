##### Rodrigues "Informal Fallacies," 
pp. 52-60 in [[Introduction-to-Philosophy-Logic.pdf]]
	"...informal fallacies; that is, mistakes not exclusively related to the logical form of the argument, but including also its content." (52)
	"So, anyone could identify fallacies by paying attention to the following: 
		1. Do the premises support the conclusion, or only offer very weak support for the conclusion? 
		2. Are the premises well-supported? 
		3. Do the argument’s premises include all the important relevant information?" (53)
	3 categories of informal fallacy:
		*Relevance fallacies:* Presenting irrelevant information for a conclusion, or not presenting relevant information
		*Ambiguity fallacies:* Presenting ambiguous, non-specific, or vague premises to avoid defining a clear argument
		*Fallacies of presumption:* Premises, which are false, unreliable, or unjustified, and which do not strictly support the conclusion, are not clearly stated and are relied upon in the conclusion 
	Common informal fallacies: 
		Offensive ad hominem
			Undermine argument based on the person arguing moral character
		Circumstantial ad hominem
			Undermine argument based on person arguing circumstances (background, etc.)
		Straw man
		Appeal to power/threat of force
		Begging the question
			Assuming the truth of the conclusion in the premises
		Appeal to popular opinion
		Appeal to pity
		Appeal to ignorance
		Equivocation 
		Hasty generalization

## Lecture

> **Normative vs informative 
> Prescriptive vs descriptive
> Ought vs is**
> These distinctions come up in various contexts: 
> 	Action
> 		Laws
> 		Morality
> 	Thought
> 		Correct and incorrect reasoning/inferences
> Cultural and ethical bases for normativity: but beyond the scope of this class
### Logic Overview
**Definition?**
> Aristotle: science of demonstration (Gary paraphrases: study of proofs?)
> Frege: founder of logic, thought of them as rules for thinking
> Priest: the science of truth preservation in a language, "soundness"
> These definitions are concerned with **deduction**
> Broadly: logic = study of argumentation

**Argument**
>Set of statements
>Premises (one or more)
	Intended to give reason to accept the conclusion
	The practice of giving reasons is key to rationality
	Normatively, there is a "good" and "bad" way of doing this
   Conclusion (one)

**Evaluating arguments:**
	Form / Content
### Deductive
> **Validity: if premises are true, conclusion is true (with no counterexamples)**
> 	Valid **and** true premises: **sound**
> Monotonic: conclusions don't have to change when premises change

**Contexts in which deduction is useful** 
> Proofs in mathematics (e.g. geometry) 
> Philosophical arguments

**Contexts in which deduction is not useful**
> Ampliative reasoning–going beyond what is entailed by the premises 
> Non-monotonic reasoning–with drawing inferences in the light of new information 
> 	Legal contexts, political debates
> 	Science?


*∴ There are contexts in which deductive validity is too stringent*
### Non-Deductive
> Inductive, or abductive
> Distinct from deductive by the normative standards proposed

#### Induction
##### Enumerative Induction
> This swan is white and that swan is white: therefore, all swans are white
> 	**Enumeration generalization schema**
> 
##### Eliminative Induction
> Used to support causal claims
> JS Mill proposed methods for this style
> **Example: Food poisoning in a restaurant**
> 	Method of agreement: what did all the sick patrons have in common? 
> 	Method of inverse agreement
> 	Method of difference: what is different between a sick and non sick patron?
> Influenced the development of "controlled" experiment
> **Work backwards from effect to cause through elimination of non-possible causes**

#### Abduction
> Inference to the best explanation
> **Example:**
> 	X has happened
> 	If Y were true, it would explain why X happened
> 	Therefore, Y is probably true
> "What makes an explanation the best?"
> 	Likelihood? – **Probabilistic format**
> 	Lipton's "Lovely" definition: Simplicity and explanatory power

**Is simplicity an epistemic virtue?**
	Van Frassen: silly to assume the world is not complicated 
	Occam: simplest is best explanation 
	Guide in hypothesizing, not inference

Darwin's Origin of Species: **appeal to explanation**
	Demonstrating the ability of his theory to **explain** many phenomena

##### How do we evaluate non-deductive arguments?
**With respect to form:** 
> Do premises lend some degree of support to conclusion? 

**With respect to content:**
> Whether the premises reflect the currently available evidence


### Fallacies
#### Formal Fallacies

#### Informal Fallacies [[COGS303 L2 Logic Overview#Rodrigues "Informal Fallacies,"]]
Informal fallacies are not always fallacious: dependent on content, so context matters
