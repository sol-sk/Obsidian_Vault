#### Validity (review)
Internal validity independent from construct validity 
	Relation to conceptual variables can be weak even if your internal validity is strong (as in, IV manipulation would affect DV)

### Developmental
#### Cross-sectional
> Surveying different age groups

**Confounds:**
- Generational differences/life experiences

#### Longitudinal 
> Studying the same group across a long period of time

Avoids confound of cross-sectional study, but is expensive and time consuming and therefore risky

#### Sequential
> Integrates cross-sectional and longitudinal: use younger and older group and follow across time

Strong evidence 

## Factorial designs
> Complex (factorial) designs = 2 or more factors

Factors = any variable that you expect to be related to some outcome variable (e.g. independent variable)

> Progression of discussion of complex designs: 2 factors
> 2 manipulated factors / 1 manipulated, 1 non-manipulated factor

**Interaction:** effect of one factor on the outcome variable depends on another factor
	Factors don't have a consistent effect on outcome variable

#### Factorial Design Example: doggy design
2 way factorial design (specifically, a 2 x 2 factorial design)
- Tells half of dogs to sit, doesn't say anything to the other half
- Holds a treat for half of dogs
- **Marginal mean**: mean between each condition

Command has an effect on dogs sitting, but it is a much stronger effect when the treat is present
