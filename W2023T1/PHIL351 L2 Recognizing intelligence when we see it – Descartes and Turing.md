[Dietrich Ch.2 ](https://www.bloomsburycollections.com/monograph-detail?docid=b-9781474257084&pdfid=9781474257084.ch-002.pdf&tocid=b-9781474257084-chapter2)
> "All in all, the Turing Test is best seen as a thought experiment: a way to reveal and, like the story of Mulan, to correct our prejudices regarding intelligence. An experiment that, indeed, says more about us, and how we treat the idea of machine intelligence, than about machine intelligence in and of itself. Indeed, if anything is being tested by the Turing Test, it is humans themselves, and our preconceptions regarding the notion of machine intelligence." (p. 35)

Behaving as thinking = thinking 
Rejects specific definition of intelligence
Turing test was meant to highlight human prejudice against idea of machine intelligence (by removing ability to see/confirm that a computer is not human, and only judging by its actions)
	Not hard fast rule set
	Mulan comparison
Explaining how something works leads people away from thinking of it as intelligent (removes the mystery that people associate w intelligence)

Consciousness is separate mystery
Lady lovelace objection: can machines make mistakes? Turing says yes

## Lecture
### [[PHIL351 L1 Introduction, definition, and objectives#Pre-history of cognitive science]]
### Descartes cont. 
**"Clockwork" mechanism of the mind is the most popular metaphor/understanding**
Deeply pro-science, contributes significantly to algebra+geometry (cartesian geometry)
	**Believed in limits of science: no automaton could display intelligent language use**
	**The capacity for verbal behavior** is what distinguishes beings with minds (humans) from beings without minds (nonhumans)
		"It cannot be said that they `[animals]` speak to each other and that we cannot understand them; because since dogs and some other animals express their passions to us, they would express their thoughts also if they had any"
		Defines speech as the **ability to show thought through language**, including signs used by the deaf
	**Takeaways**
	Believed that there could certainly exist a machine which can speak, even in ways which make it appear to be feeling sensations and emotions: but it is "inconceivable" that this speaking machine would ever be able to speak in a "genuinely meaningful" way 
		**"Inconceivable" = logically impossible? What does he mean and how does he argue this?** 
	**Descartes describes intelligent behavior, but not what qualifies this behavior as intelligent**
	**What are the ethical implications of Descartes' position (moral status of nonverbal beings?)**
		"Relieves the human conscience" to categorize animals in this way (and to kill and eat them)
#### Descartes' conclusions
"A being's possessing requisite linguistic competence verifies its status as not exclusively 
mechanical."
"A being's lacking the requisite linguistic competence verifies its status as merely mechanical."
"Natural science can be used to penetrate the inner workings of everything in nature *but us*. The scientific revolution will thus never be a *complete* revolution."

#### In summary
Descartes conceptualizes the mind through his lens of *dualism* but also in the sense of man-as-machine, where the mind exists like a clockwork mechanism
Believed that **verbal behavior** separated human intelligence from non-human non-intelligence
Believed that automata would never be able to replicate intelligent verbal behavior 

#### The paradox of mechanical reason
> "Reasoning (on the computational model) is the manipulation of meaningful symbols according to rational rules (an integrated system). Hence there must be some sort of manipulator to carry out those manipulations. There seem to be two basic possibilities: either the manipulator pays attention to what the symbols and rules *mean*, or it doesn't. If it does pay attention to the meanings, then it can't be entirely mechanical because meanings (whatever exactly they are) don't exert physical forces. On the other hand, if the manipulator does not pay attention to the meanings, then the manipulations can't be instances of reasoning – because what's reasonable or not depends crucially on what the symbols mean. In a word, if a process or system is mechanical, it can't reason; if it reasons, it can't be mechanical. That's the paradox of mechanical reason."
> John Haugeland, 1985

Proposed explanation for Descartes description of mechanical reasoning as "inconceivable"

### The 'cognitive revolution'
#### Alan Turing (1912-1954)
> Founder of computer science and cryptography 
> The Enigma code in WWII
> Death by cyanide poisoning

##### Turing Test
"Can machines think"
* Judge writes to a human and to a machine, separated visually so as to only judge by the written responses
**Can read as a response to Descartes**
**Agreements:**
	Human verbal behavior provides an interesting/illuminating empirical standard for the presence of intelligence
	To satisfy this criterion would consist in being (relevantly) indistinguishable from a normal human speaker
		Both Turing and Descartes filter out irrelevant differences to the intelligence of the speaker
**Disagreements:**
	Turing wrote that competent verbal behavior is an empirically *sufficient* condition for the ascription of intelligence
	Descartes wrote that competent verbal behavior is an empirically *necessary* condition for the ascription of intelligence
		Descartes is ready to infer non-intelligence from a system's failing the test: Turing wants to defend the system from prejudicial judgement, and not assume that the test is the *only* determiner of intelligence
	Is the notion of a "thinking machine" an oxymoron? Descartes thought so, Turing did not
		Turing is motivated to replace the abstract question of "can machines think" with a more empirical sounding question of "can a machine meet these criteria"

What were Turing's intentions in proposing the imitation game as a test for intelligence? 
	Typically read as offering operational definition or an empirically sufficient condition for intelligence
		Some kinks to be ironed out: duration of test, how often the machine has to win, how many judges should there be
