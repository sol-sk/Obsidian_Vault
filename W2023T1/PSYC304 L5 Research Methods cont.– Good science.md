#### [[PSYC304 L4 Research Methodsâ€“ Bad science#Intuition]]
Problems: intuition is often wrong (i.e. assuming heavy objects fall faster)

#### Observation
>  Can be incomplete, limited ability to learn
>  ie. Moniz' lobotomies

#### Scientific skepticism 
> Question authority and intuition 
> Question senses
> Question knowledge, beliefs
> *Systematic* doubt and continual testing

Caution about extreme skepticism, weaponized 

### Good science
#### Principles of research
Disinterestedness
	Insofar as possible not concerned with results
Organized skepticism
	Evaluate research based on quality > status
Communality
	Methods and results are freely available to anyone: anyone can evaluate data or replicate exp.
Universalism 
	Systematic observations, universally agreed upon standards: more objective
Materialism
	Everything is made of matter: has material basis

#### Developing theories

### Pseudoscience

### Goals of psychological research
> Describe, predict behavior. 
> Determine causes of behavior; explain behavior. 
> Apply knowledge to solve problems. (influence/control behavior?)

### Basic vs Applied research

### Non-experimental methods
