For lit review, thesis might be something like "With respect to question X, there are two schools of thought, A and B"

### Replications (slide 16 onward)

Using bayes theorem to understand the results of replication studies: 
failed replications contraindicate the original study but do not disprove it, and successful replications reinvigorate the original but do not prove it 

### Open Science
#### Reading: [[Open Science Collaboration.pdf]]
##### Study Description
- Selected studies from 1 year, across 2 journals
- Assigned teams of researchers to replicate 
- original researchers consulted
- one key focus per study
- results: 
	- Measured according to significance, p val, effect size, researchers' subjective assessment, meta analysis of effect sizes
**Significance testing:**
- Nearly all of the original studies claimed statistically significant results; aka, results would be highly unlikely if hypothesis were false (if null hypothesis were true)
	- If all original results were correct, 89% of studies should have replicated; **actual number was 35%**
**Results by difference in p-values:** 
- How many studies came within 95% confidence interval? **47%** 
**Effect size:**
- Strength of relationship between two variables
- Effect size went down I believe 
Results by subjective assessment 
- Replicators were asked if the study had successfully replicated
- Nearly identical to the first method, significance results
- (seems to) Indicates that significance tests are highly regarded as a gold standard for research (too highly regarded?)
Results by meta-analysis

##### Sources of the problem: 
**Systemic problems**
- **Publication bias**
- **Incentive structure to publish innovative results**
- Over-reliance on statistical significance tests
Individual problems: 
- HARKing
- Outright fraud
- P-hacking

#### Publication bias
- Some journals do not publish replication studies
- What's the motivation to try a replication study if it has 0 chance of getting published? 
- "Innovation points out paths that are possible, replication points out paths that are likely. Progress relies on both."
- **Reichenbach: context of discovery vs context of justification**

### Reading: HARKing
[[Kerr1998HARking.pdf]]
**Hypothesizing after results are known**
##### Prediction vs accommodation
Debate dates back to 18th/19th c. 
Herschell and Whewell argued that theories that made novel predictions that came true could not ahve done so by chance
Mill and later Keynes opposed this view, thinking that hypothesizing was mere speculation
Contemporary Bayesians side with mill and keynes bc it includes more evidence
