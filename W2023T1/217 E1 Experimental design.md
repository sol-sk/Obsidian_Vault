## Experimental design
> Allow for causality due to higher internal validity
> 	Achieved through **experimental control** and **random assignment**

#### Independent variable
> Manipulated by researcher
> Not present in correlational design
> The "cause"
> Multiple levels/conditions
> 	*Everything but the IV should be the same across conditions*

#### Dependent variable (DV or OV)
> Outcome
> Change based on levels of IV
#### Experimental control
> Minimize **confounds**
#### Confounds
> Variable which **co-varies along with the IV**
> *Could explain all or part of the result*


#### Example
**Sleep study**
	Hypothesis:
		People who sleep longer the night before a test will perform better than those who sleep for less time
	IV:
		Amount of sleep
		Conditionsâ€“ 1/2 participants sleep 8 hours, 1/2 participants sleep 4 hours
	DV:
		Test performance
		Everyone completes the same memory test
		Compare average score of the two groups
	Confound: 
		Alarm clock use (8 hr group doesn't require alarm, 4 hr group does)
