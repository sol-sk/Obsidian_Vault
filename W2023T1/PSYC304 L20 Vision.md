### Lecture
#### Rods
- Rods create most of image (peripheral)
- Extremely sensitive
- Not sensitive to wavelength of light
- Critical for night vision
- Important for perceiving movement/changes in light stim
- Pigment gets bleached out by daytime light → enter dark room, slowly gain pigment back & we can see better
- Strong bright light at edge of periphery causes same change in neurotransmisison as dim light near center
	- Due to number of cells

* Most sensitive at 495 nanometers; rods can't tell if there is a dim blue-green light or bright yellow light 

#### Cones
- ~7 million cells 
- Less sensitive to light, but 
	- Sensitive to wavelength of light 
- Three types of cones 
	- Most mammals only have 2
- Located mostly in the fovea (explains why fovea less useful at night) 
- Critical for perceiving colour 
- Important for acuity (not cones per se…)

Wavelength and color are not 1:1 relationship 

#### Colorblindness in humans
Tritanopia: rare in humans
Achromatopsia: very rare, typically damage to occipital lobe

#### Acquired trichromacy
Possible to do gene insertion that allows animals to see new colors

#### Parallel processing, convergence
**Rods**: 
**Convergence** (multiple rods feed to individ bipolar cells, multiple of which feed into a single ganglion cell) → high sensitivity, low acuity
→ results in blurriness in periphery 

**Cones**: 
**No (probably actually a little) convergence** → high acuity, low sensitivity 
1:1:1 cone → bipolar → ganglion: we know exactly where light hits retina

#### Lateral inhibition and Mach bands
We detect *contrast* not absolute values

Each solid bar appears to have a slight gradient, appearing darker on the right and lighter on the left

**Receptive fields**: any cell in your eye is somewhat specific a region that light is coming from: receptive fields (regions of brain) communicate w specific cells

Cat studies very common in this time (1950s)

Mapping activation of ganglion cells based on where on a screen a light is coming from 
Light in periphery of receptive field *decreases* firing → "On center, off surround cell" 
- = number of cells which are "off center, on surround"

Purple: outside **receptive field**
Blue and red are "competing"→ **Lateral inhibition** is the function that creates on center/off surround or vice versa 

##### Mach bands revisited
Lateral inhibition: 
![[Screen Shot 2023-11-30 at 10.40.04 AM.png]]
Cells on left are *less* laterally inhibited because of the darker color nearer to them → they appear *lighter*
Cells on right are *more* laterally inhibited because of the lighter color (more light acting on cells) nearer to them → they appear *darker*
