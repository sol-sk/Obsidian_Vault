[[217 E1 Canons of Science (D.E.P.T.)]]
	Canons of science: 
	determinism - things are caused by other things
	empiricism - thinks are empirically verifiable (the world can be observed)
	parsimony - simplest possible explanation
	testability  - things should be falsifiable
[[217 E1 Basic definitions - Scientific Method]]
[[217 E1 Goals of Psychological Science]]
	to explain-determine cause of- behavior + thought (inc emotion)
	to predict behavior + thought 
	to be able to predictably cause certain behavior + thought
[[217 E1 "Unscientific" methods]]
	pseudoscience: unfalsifiable, misattributing cause, correlation = causation, 
	E.F.A.I.: Experience / Folk wisdom / authority / intuition
[[217 E1 What makes theories good?]]
	Falsifiability
[[217 E1 Parsimonious]]
	Requires fewer assumptions 
	Requires fewer adjustments to existing science
[[217 E1 Types of studies]]
	Observational design
	Correlation design
	Experimental design
		Between subjects 
		Within subjects
	Quasi-experimental design
[[217 E1 Correlation design]]
	r = correlation coefficient = the degree to which variation in one thing is matched by variation in another thing (**linear**)
	third variable = is there a third thing causing the variation?
	bidirectionality = what is causing what ?
	testing internal validity: 
		temporal precedence
		operationalization
		eliminate plausible alternatives
[[217 E1 Experimental design]]
	IV / DV-OV, minimize confounds thru experimental control and random assignment 
> [[217 E1 Operationism- Operational definitions]]
> 	Observable, measurable indicator for variable
> 	External and internal validity: does it map onto other research, outside world + does it accurately measure what your hypothesis is trying to study
> > [[217 E1 Operational definitions of IV - Straightforward vs Staged]]
> > 	Straightforward: present participants IV that will directly influence DV
> > 		Pros: easy to measure, simple / Cons: demand characteristics, artificiality
> > 	Staged: present participants with a situation that will indirectly illicit state
> > 		Pros: more realistic, avoid demand characteristics / Cons: less predictable outcome, difficult
> > [[217 E1 Operational definition of DV]]
> > 	Self report
> > 	Behavioral
> > 	Physiological
> > 	Manipulation check: rule out confounds or other factors that influence DV / measure whether or not the different arms of study are actually representative of manipulations in IV (and not other aspects of study)
> [[217 E1 Experimental Study Design -  Between subjects]]
> 	Between subjects: arms of study use different groups as the different arms of study, with each group getting one scenario/variation of IV
> 	*Random assignment* must ensure that other participant variables are not affecting OV
> 	Posttest design: only tests participants on OV after the IV has been presented 
> 	Pretest-posttest design: establishes a pre-IV baseline for subjects and then compares to posttest result after IV presentation 
> [[217 E1 Experimental Study Design - Within subjects]]
> 	Each subject is presented with multiple variations on IV to compare their changes with reference to themselves rather than changes with reference to another group with different IV manipulation
> 	**Concurrent measures design** 
> 		Present with Scenario A, B, C and ask participant how they would compare each scenario only after all have been presented 
> 		Pros: avoids carryover effects to a degree / Cons: doesn't allow for much complexity in DV(s), *strong demand characteristics*
> 	**Repeated measures design**
> 		Ask participant after each scenario, A, then B, then C. Can gain greater degree of insight at each stage of survey/measurement of subject
> 		Pros: participants serve as their own control (like pretest-posttest), requires fewer participants / Cons: carryover effects (fatigue, practice, contrast), demand characteristics
> 			Prevention of carryover effects through *counterbalance* which ensures each participant experiences a different order in the scenarios 
> 		**Within subject designs can detect error better with fewer participants**
