**Controlling voluntary movement (example)**
	Prefrontal cortex
		Deciding what to do 
	Premotor areas
		Mapping a "plan" of movement
	Motor cortex
		Sends signal to cause muscles to move, *efferent*
	Basal ganglia
		"skills" control; learned ability
	Pons
		Signal passes through this, among other structures at base with lots of axons
	Cerebellum
		Course correction

### Support networks
#### Blood flow

Only these 4 arteries go in: limited supply, no redundancy, no reserves
	; Anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries all serve non-overlapping areas
No energy storageâ€“ needs constant supply

Damage (Cerebrovascular disorders): extremely bad

#### Blood brain barrier

Bloodstream is: 
	Tightly packed (compared to rest of body, which has capillary pores): "tight junctions"
	Protects brain 
	Active transport for large molecules
**Astrocytes surround and protect**

**Pathogens can still access brain through gaps:** 
	Intersection between hypothalamus and pituitary, where hormones travel: less protective
	Olfactory passages: more porous

#### Meninges
**Dura mater**
> Outermost layer, very durable 

**Arachnoid membrane**
> Easy to damage, spiderweb-like

**Pia mater**
> Very thin, like plastic wrap 
#### Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)

**4 ventricles - pockets of CSF in brain** 
	CSF is produced in lateral ventricles
**Between layers of meninges**
**Purpose** 
> Nutritional 
> Almost certainly "washing" or removing metabolic waste: connection to sleep 
> Reduce impact of force, like airbag: both around brain and pockets in brain
