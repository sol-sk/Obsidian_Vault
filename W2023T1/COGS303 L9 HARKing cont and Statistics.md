### HARKing Cont
How do we prevent the bad sort of HARKing? 
- Pre-registration: Study is accepted for publication prior to the test being done: it's going to be published regardless
	- Removes some incentive to have ground-breaking innovation
	- Can't revise purpose of test

### Statistics
#### Bayesian vs Frequentists
Frequentists favor objective interpretation
- Coin flip exercise: in the long run, heads will results 50% of the time
Bayesian favor the subjective interpretation
> Includes beliefs about world

Probability = reasonable explanation


#### Significance testing
Uses deductive logic
Result of popper's schema, if Ho is rejected, it corroborated Ha, but it cannot confirm it (because nothing can)

##### Fisher
##### Neyman-Pearson
