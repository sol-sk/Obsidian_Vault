### Justice
> Fairness and sound rational in participant recruitment

> One pop should not bear all risks
> Protect disempowered and vulnerable populations 

##### 1940s-1950s Malnutrition experiment in residential schools
> Created severe health problems, including denial to dental care and deaths due to exacerbated anemia

* **No consent/assent, no awareness of study, and no voice for the vulnerable**

##### 1960s: Sixties scoop
> Viewed as social experiment on assimilation 
> Affected virtually all indigenous communities across Canada

#### Research with Indigenous Populations
Indigenous populations often bear disproportionate costs of research
> Exploitation, taking a lot and giving a little/nothing, taking credit for working with Indigenous communities

> **Special process for ethical clearance for research**


### Animal Research
**Benefits of animal research**
- Allows researchers to control genetic makeup of "participants" being studied
- Allows researchers to more easily study physiological, neurological, and genetic foundations of behavior

**Heavily regulated!**
- Ethics of animal research: 3 R's
	- Replacement 
		- Only do studies with animals if alternatives do not exist (e.g. computer simulations)
	- Refinement
		- Minimise or eliminate animal distress by modifying experimental procedures
	- Reduction
		- Adopt experimental designs that require the fewest animal subjects possible

**Animal rights groups tend to believe that:**
- Animals are just as likely as humans to experience suffering: animal research is allowed only if human subjects are also allowed to be used
- Animals have inherent value and rights, equal to those of humans: animals should not bear burden of research to benefit another species
*Demonstrates a dedication to Justice, as they see it*

## Measurements
Non-Experimental: all variables are measured
Experimental: DV is measured

Qualitative scales: 
- Nominal: when assigned numerical values are meaningless
Quantitative scales: 
- Ordinal: numbers have rudimentary meaning due to their order (best off/worst off, least/most)
- Interval: lacks a non-arbitrary 0 (degrees Celcius/Fahrenheit)
- Ratio: has an unambiguous 0 (degrees Kelvin, mass)
Validity 
Reliability
