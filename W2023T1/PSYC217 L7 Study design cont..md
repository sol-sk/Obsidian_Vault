#### Increasing internal validity
**Can the difference in the DV be attributed only to the manipulation of the IV?**
##### Random assignment
> Allows researchers to balance out influence random variables across diff. conditions, on average
> More effective the more participants: outliers balance each other out
##### Experimental control
- Covariation between variables
- IV precedes DV
- No confounds
**Practical considerations**
	Ensuring only IV changes
	Avoiding alternative explanation.: *demand characteristics, experimenter expectancy effects*
**Optimizing operational definition of IV and DV** 
	Avoiding *ceiling* and *floor effects*
	Appropriately pairing IV and DV

###### Demand characteristics
> Feature of an experiment that might inform participants of the purpose of the study
> 	Threat to internal validity
> 	Participants may try to help/hurt hypothesis
> 		Participant reactance
> 		Evaluation apprehension
> 		Stereotype threat: participant performing in conformity with how they are stereotyped

**How to avoid demand characteristics:**
	Single blind study
	Distractor/filler items (misleading)
