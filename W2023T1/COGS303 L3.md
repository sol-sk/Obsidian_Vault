### Pre class readings
#### Bertrand Russell, "On Induction"
[[russell_induction.pdf]]
> We believe that things will continue to happen as they have happened, barring evidence of interference, based on laws of nature: *is there evidence that the laws of nature are unchanging?*

**Uniformity of nature**
> "The belief in the uniformity of nature is the belief that everything that has happened or will happen is an instance of some general law to which there are no exceptions." (2)
> 	Other animals are inclined to go where they have gone before, to rely on the static state of the world as they know it

**What principle allows us to believe that future futures will follow the same laws as past futures? 

**How do we know that the same laws apply between familiar and unfamiliar fields?**

###### Principle of Induction
> (a) When thing A is repeatedly found associated with thing B, and never found dissociated from thing B, the greater the number of instances they are found together the greater the probability that both will be present if one is present
> (b) A sufficient number of cases of association will make the probability of a new association nearly a certainty, and will approach certainty without limit
> In terms of general laws:
> 	The greater number of cases of A and Bs association, the more probable it is that A will **always** be associated with B, and
> 	A sufficient number of cases will allow this **general law** to approach certainty without limit

Because induction relies on probability rather than certainty, it cannot be *disproven* by an appeal to contradicting evidence: only the law or absolute association can be shown as erroneous
Conversely, it can also not be *proven* by appeal to evidence
	There will always be unexamined cases

**Induction allows us to believe in future or unknown events**

#### Reichenbach, *Experience and Prediction*
pp. 3-16, or 2-9 of pdf [[Reichenbach1938.pdf]]

**Knowledge is a sociological fact**

###### Tasks of Epistemology
> Descriptive: 
> 	Giving a description of knowledge as it really is
>Critical:
>	The investigation of the validity and reliability of a system of knowledge
>	The analysis of science
> Advisory:
> 	The proposal of which decisions to make in science


##### The Descriptive Task
> Internal relations: utterances belonging to the content of knowledge
> 
> External relations: combine knowledge with utterances of another, non-knowledge related type
> 
> *Epistemology is only concerned with **internal** relations; sociology blends the two*

Internal structures of knowledge = system of connections in thinking: psychological science
	Epistemology is *not* trying to emulate nebulous and illogical thinking processes
	Epistemology is *creating* thinking processes in a way that follows a consistent system
		***"rational reconstruction"***

Context of discovery 
	The means of thinking which led to discovery 

Epistemology is concerned with **Context of justification**
	The means of *presenting* or *communicating* this thinking 

##### The Critical Task: the analysis of science

Volitional bifurcations: where decisions regarding conventions are not equivalent but divergent 

**Object fact**
	 facts regarding which decisions have been used in science 
**Logical fact**
	facts regarding the decisions themselves (the character being a decision rather than a statement)
		decisions can be wrong, but the fact is that they are decisions 

Logical analysis highlights the points in science which are certainly true, but must be decided on; descriptive epistemology highlights what decision is in use

**Entailed decisions**
	Decisions that are involved by one decision (ie. if you have decided to use metric, you have decided not to use feet, inches, etc.)
	Epistemology must discover the *interconnections* between decisions (which are logical fact)
	Can separate the arbitrary (such as conventionalism) from substantial knowledge 

##### The Advisory Task
> In cases where decisions presupposed by positive science are not clarified, making a proposal (but not a determination of truth) concerning a decision


#### Popper, *Conjectures and Refutations*
[[Popper excerpt from Conjectures and Refutations.pdf]]
Uses Marxism, Adlerism, and Freudian psychoanalysis as examples of theories which are *unfalsifiable*

Anecdote; Adler says that he is sure a behavior is an example of his theory in action because he "has seen many cases in which it is": the first case confirms the theory, each additional case can only continue to confirm it because there is already evidence that it is true

***Risky predictions can be wrong***
	Precision rather than vagueness

Finally re-affirming the importance of myth in guiding science, and the kernels of truth that lie within falsehoods

Proposes falsifiability as a solution to the problem of demarcation between science and pseudoscience

## Lecture

### Epistemology
> Traditionally very individualistic, modern movement towards social epistemology: Reichenbach is ahead of the curve 

### Reichenbach's approach to epistemology (review of reading)
[[Reichenbach1938.pdf]]
> Begin with knowledge as *social fact*
> **How** do we know what we know? 
> Not overly concerned with skepticism


Internal relations are not **actual** thought processes: this is psychology
	"Rational reconstruction" is an idealization

##### Descriptive vs Normative 
**Descriptive account of knowledge:** 
	Characterization of knowledge as it happens to occur
	Can be studied empirically
	**Context of discovery**
**Normative account of knowledge:** 
	Characterization of knowledge as it ought to be
	Done logically rather than empirically
	**Context of justification**

**Example: Einstein's Theory of Relativity**
Context of discovery: the (1915) daydream Einstein had that led him to develop the theory
Context of justification: the 1919 Eddington experiments that confirmed the theory

These two processes are not always *temporally* distinct, but they are *conceptually* distinct


### Popper, Conjectures and Refutations
**How do we evaluate claims made by scientists?
What type of logic is appropriate for evaluating scientific claims?**
Sir Karl Popper (1902-1994)
Austrian Jewish
Left Austria in 1930s for NZ
Post-WWII, went to London School of Econ for rest of career
Wrote influential work on political philosophy

[[Popper excerpt from Conjectures and Refutations.pdf]]
**Hypothetico-deductive schema**
1. Theory T implies observation O: T ⊃ O 
2. O 
3. ∴ T
4. Not valid
**Popper schema (compare to Hypothetico-deductive)**
1. Theory T implies observation O: T ⊃ O 
2. ~O 
3. ∴ ~T
4. Valid!

The question of demarcation
	Science is by definition falsifiable (necessary condition)
Theories must be rejected if they are falsified
	Theories must be corroborated by data, although the amount of data required to "confirm" a theory is not defined

##### Null Hypothesis Significance Testing
> Application of Popper's theory

**Example**
River forecast: 
	Doesn't meet Popper's criterion (not "risky" because it also claims the opposite could happen), same considerations apply to pandemic, climate modeling
	Still very much science!

**Problems with Popper**
We can't test theories in isolation from background assumptions
	Our theories are based on unstated assumptions, which we then take as fact when the experiment is successful (even if they are not in fact true)
Modified Popper theory:
	Theory T, with some background assumption B, implies O
1. (T^B) ⊃ O
2. ~O 
3. ∴ ~T v ~B 

#### In summary
Deductive logic is not an appropriate tool for telling us when to accept or to reject scientific theories 
	Deductive logic in non-ampliative: 
		Deductive conclusions are always entailed by premises
		**Scientific conclusions go beyond what is observed**
**Inductive logic:**
### Russell, on Induction 
[[russell_induction.pdf]]
##### Mathematical induction
1. Take base case
2. Assume principle 
3. Apply to base case

Russell believes knowledge requires certainty

**Hypothetico-deductive schema**
	Theory T implies observation O 
	O is observed
	Therefore, T is true
1. T ⊃ O 
2. O
3. ∴ T
4. Not valid!
