### Cantwell-Smith, "History"
pp. 7-21 [[The Promise Of Artificial Intelligence Reckoning And Judgment (Brian Cantwell Smith) (Z-Library).pdf]]

##### First Wave of AI (GOFAI)
First wave AI: based on symbolic representation 
Haugeland: "good old-fashioned Artificial Intelligence" (GOFAI)
	C1 essence of intelligence is thought: rational deliberation
	C2 ideal model of thought is logical inference
	C3 perception is at a lower level than thought and will not be that conceptually demanding 
	C4 ontology of the world is *formal*: discrete, well-defined, mesoscale objects exemplifying properties and standing in unambiguous relations
Tie to computation: 
	P1 the system *works* mechanically in ways explicable by science, which we can build without magic
	P2 the system's behavior and constituents support *semantic interpretation*: can be taken to be about facts and situations in the outside world
		The above two are recognized as fundamental to logical structure and "formal symbol manipulation" in computing 
		Less commonly, but still important: 
	P3 the system is *normatively* assessed or governed in terms of the semantic interpretation
		Aka: is the output true? 
	P4 in general, semantic relations to the world (including reference) are *not effective*
		Aka, cannot be done by physical or mechanical means 
		Smith says this is **the problem that intelligence is "designed" to solve**

There is no physical output to thought: it cannot be physically prevented nor detected
"Non-effectiveness of reference and semantics"

> "Representations have two criterial properties: (i) they stand in noneffective semantic relations with what is distal, with what is not immediately effectively available (what they represent); and (ii) they can nevertheless effect or be affected by physical changes within causal proximity." (16)
> 	This is what allows an intelligent system to be physically possible
###### Representational mandate
> "The proper functioning of any world-directed system—any system that is thinking about or representing or processing information about the world—must be governed by normative criteria (P3) applying to its mechanical operations (P1) that are framed in terms of situations and states of affairs in the world that the system is representing or reasoning about (P2), which situations and states of affairs will not, in the general case, be within effective (causal) reach (P4)."
> (17)
> 	-> All intelligence must be **deferential**



## Lecture

#### Review
> Behavioral markers of intelligence:
> 	goal-directedness, appropriateness, flexibility, transferability, manipulability
> Historical background for Turing machines:
> 	Formalism and Hilbert's program are showing that mathematics (arithmetic) is a purely formal system: avoid appeal to intuitions
> 		**Mathematical rules are "meaningless" and thus can be represented completely mechanically**
> 	What is an algorithm/effective methods

#### Turing Machine
> Ideal machine composed of infinitely long tape, divided into cells
> Cells have symbols which can be written and erased
> Machine head can read, erase, or move between cells
> 	Determined by "machine state"
> Non-ambiguous, syntactically governed

##### Turing proves:
**There exists a Turing machine for every recursive function 
There exists a universal Turing machine which can run all other Turing machines virtually** 

Descartes (review): "Reasoning" is inherently semantic because it relates to *meaning*, which cannot be mechanical: Paradox of mechanical reasoning appears to be **solved** by Turing

#### Implications for cognitive science: an alternative to Behaviorism?
> Mechanistic account of human psychology/cognition 

Behaviorism prohibits the consideration of internal processes: Dietrich explains this as being a result of logical positivism 
	**Logical positivism:** there exist trivially true propositions (logic, mathematics), synthetic propositions (have a meaning which can be verified ie scientific hypotheses)
	Behaviorists consider the study of intelligence- through the presumption of intelligence -circular: can't appeal to reason to explain reason
	Turing lifts paradox of mechanical reasoning: manipulation of representation, computation, no *longer presupposes intelligence because it can be done mechanically*

#### Computational theory of mind
> Intelligent behavior is caused by intelligence (rather than being = to it)
> 	Manifestation of representational activity (thinking and reasoning)

#### Cantwell-Smith cont. (Ch. 2)
Representational Mandate
Identifying minimal features in a mechanical reasoning system
	Effectiveness of physics: Physically local, mechanically detectable
	Non-effectiveness of semantics: Not mechanically detectable

**Purpose of intelligence is to ensure the right kinds of normative relations to things which cannot be physically detected** 
	Smith calls this ***deference***
