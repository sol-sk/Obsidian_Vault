### Non-experimental methods
Correlation
	When variable control isn't possible
	Third variable problem
Causality
Confounding Variable
	[[PSYC217 L6 Study design#Confounds]]
### Experimental methods
Placebo condition
	Exception: if treatment already exists
	Animal models; vehicle (aka solvent without drug)
Treatment arms
Blinded procedures
	Open label: drug is potentially harmful and patients need to know if they're on it

#### Animal Models
> Understand basic mechanisms, genetics, etc. 
> Because there are no viable alternatives, 
> Because they have high predictive value, 
> Have a number of protections in place

Can't really be used for ADHD, OCD: we know comparatively much less about these than ie. addiction

#### Human research
> Ethical considerations 
> 	Federally mandated committees review human research proposals
> 	Informed consent, which can be revoked at any time


### Statistical Analysis
>$r^2$ value
>Standard regression equation
>	$y = mx + b$
>	y = dependent variable
>	m = coefficient rate and slope of line
>	x = independent variable
>	b = y intercept

Standard error: how far the sample mean is from the population mean
Statistical significance
	comparing test measurement to control measurement, while taking sample size into account
	**p < 0.05**
		Likelihood of correct measurement 
		Chance of false positive or false negative
		p = .00001 = very very low chance of result being due to noise (but does not measure effect size)
		p threshold of .05 may be flawed:
			fMRI: each voxel (of 60k-1mil) requires statistical test: 5% false rate is 50k wrong out of 1mil!
		**p hacking**: running many comparisons and picking the ones that cross threshold
	**Cohen's d**
		Measure of magnitude of effect size

Construct validity
> how well operationalization captures what you intended to capture

Face validity: on its face, does it measure? 
Content validity: did you capture all components of variable
Concurrent and convergent validity: does your data line up with other data
Discriminant validity: no relationship between meaningless things

Internal
External validity:
	Does data apply to larger population?
