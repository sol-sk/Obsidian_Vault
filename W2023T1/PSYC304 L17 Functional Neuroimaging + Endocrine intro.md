Not directly recording voltage changes

### PET 
Using radioactive cocaine: 
- Track where it goes, see where cocaine effects brain (basal ganglia)

Using radioactive glucose: 
- Track where is using more energy

**Subtraction method** (also called: mean difference images, paired image subtraction)
- Subtract control (baseline noise) from experimental: shows *difference* between groups

> Positrons from radioactivity are released, collide w electrons in brain →   photons are produced, exit head, are detects

**Unique: Can look at specific systems, proteins, activity in parts of brain**

#### Problems with PET
Very expensive (thousands)
- Cyclotron has to continuously make radioactive molecules
Large voxels: low spatial resolution
Limit to radiation accuracy, inherently random
Temporally slow: takes 45+ minutes

**Useful for targeting specific systems**
Can see degradation of dopamine system over age
Dopamine receptors decrease by addiction
### fMRI
Oxygenated vs deoxygenated blood have different magnetic properties
##### Hemodynamic response
**Latency of 6 seconds** for blood to go to active area of brain

> Use as *indirect* measure of brain activity

**BOLD response:** Blood oxygen level dependent

fMRI is overlayed on structural MRI to see better

##### Why do blood oxygen levels change?
Astrocytes have receptors that bind to neurotransmitters to tell *blood vessel* what dendrites are doing
- "feet" on blood vessels cause them to dilate
- Astrocytes say "this region is active more blood is needed"

**Paired image subtraction also used**
- Quality of results depends on quality of controls: teapot example

### Event-related fMRI 
Common in fMRI these days
Allows you to avoid paired image subtraction
Has many of its own challenges (boredom)

Problems with interpreting fMRI studies? 
1. Spatial averaging = average is *not representative* of any one person
2. Spatial resolution = smaller voxel = higher resolution
3. Temporal resolution = takes a long time
4. Not necessarily necessity = no guarantee that recorded brain activity is *causing* behavior (correlates) 
5. Focus on increases in activity = more thinking ≠ more brain activity (**resting state functional connectivity**) 
	1. Some regions are more active at rest than during a task (Default mode network)
	2. Active "seed" area (area we are tracking): what areas are active at same time as seed? 
6. Regional hemodynamics = some regions of brain have different hemodynamic responses
7. Confounds: anxiety, boredom = scanner sucks!
8. Drugs 
9. Anticipatory hemodynamics = brain knows that you're doing something so it brings in blood *before activity occurs*
10. Reliability = replication crisis (30% retestability)
11. Statistics = huge amount of false positives 
	1. Bonferroni

#### The heavy metal brain
Measured resting-state functional connectivity of default-mode networks compared to *classical music lovers* (control group for whatever reason)
- Many poor assumptions
- Multiple methods is *critical*: not actually measuring any behavior, interpreting brain activity with little basis

### Endocrine System
#### First experiment on hormones: Berthold 1849
Roosters have comb + waddle, are more aggressive
Loss of function: remove testes *early vs later* in life
- If you remove them after comb and waddle develop, few changes
- If you remove them before, they crow less, don't develop, don't mount hens, aren't aggressive
Then: **replace testes**, putting them back in to body (altho without connections)
- Roosters that did not develop due to removal developed normally after testes were implanted
- No connections necessary: *chemical secreted* that has chemical and developmental effects
	- "secretory blood-borne chemical"

**Exocrine glands**
Sweat, saliva, tear ducts (release chemical out of body)
#### Endocrine glands
Gonad, thyroid, pituitary 
Many cells secrete chemicals
- Released primarily by glands (but also other tissues)
- Released generally (but also locally)
- Released primarily by animals (but also plants)

**Different types**:
- Neurocrine 
	- Neurotransmitters
- Endocrine 
	- Into bloodstream
- Autocrine 
	- Cell releasing message to itself (autoreceptors)
- Paracrine 
	- Local area rather than bloodstream (such as in digestion)
- Pheromone 
	- Communicate to other animals in *same species*
- Allomone
	- *Between species* eg. Flower to bee communication

#### Principles of hormone function
Contrast to nervous system: 
- Slow acting, gradual effects (hours or days)
- Behavior changes in intensity/probability rather than polarity: potentiate or amplify existing behaviors (isn't the same kind of control that nervous system has)
- Behavior and hormone release are reciprocal: behavior can affect hormones
- Multiplicity of action
- Secretion is often pulsatile and rhythmic: circadian rhythm, cortisol/melatonin release
- Hormones can interact
- Hormones need receptors: chemical messages need to be received (similar t)
