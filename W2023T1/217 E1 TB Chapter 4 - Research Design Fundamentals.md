## TB learning objectives - Research design
1. LO1 Compare and contrast non-experimental and experimental research methods. 
2. LO2 Define the term operationalization for a variable. 
3. LO3 Give examples of confounding variables and describe how to avoid them. 
4. LO4 Describe different possible relationships between variables: positive, negative, curvilinear, no relationship, and mediating. 
5. LO5 Distinguish between an independent variable and a dependent variable. 
6. LO6 Discuss how the three criteria for inferring causation are achieved (or not) in experimental and non-experimental methods. 
7. LO7 Describe why multiple methods are used for research, including the advantages and disadvantages of the basic designs.

##### operationalization
> a definition of the variable in terms of exactly what operations or techniques will be carried out in a particular study to represent that variable.

##### situational variable 
> characteristics of a situation or environment to which the participant is exposed.

###### response variable 
> the responses or behaviours of participants, such as reaction time in response to a stimulus, performance on a cognitive task, and emotional reactions. 
> *Response variables are measured in either experimental or non-experimental designs*

##### participant variable 
> a characteristic that individuals bring with them to a study, including cultural background, age, intelligence, and personality traits such as extraversion.

##### confounds 
> variables that we are not interested in, but are intertwined with our variable of interest, and can also explain our results. 

##### mediating variable 
> a psychological process that helps to explain the relationship between two other variable
### non-experimental method
> relationships are studied by measuring or observing the variables of interest. This could include asking people to describe their behaviour, directly observing behaviour, recording physiological responses, or examining publicly available information
##### correlational methods
> we examine whether the variables correlate or vary together
##### third-variable problem 
> some other variable that we haven’t measured, C, may be why we observe this association between A and B

##### determining direction of causality: temporal precedence
> what comes first in time
### experimental method 
> involves direct manipulation of one variable, control of several other variables (those not of interest), and then measurement of an outcome variable (hypothetically affected by the manipulated variable). 

***The differences between non-experimental and experimental methods have important implications for the types of conclusions we can draw from the results.***

#### Designing for causal inference: Internal validity
- The independent variable is manipulated and *then* dependent variable is then measured. Experiments allow for causal inferences in part because they incorporate **temporal precedence.**
- *Changes in one variable must be accompanied by changes in the other*: **covariance**
- Attempt to eliminate the influence of all other variables except for the IV: **eliminate plausible alternative explanations for the observed relationship**
	- **Experimental control**: every other feature of the control and experimental conditions *is held constant, except for the IV* 
	- **Random assignment**: If something cannot be held constant across conditions, we control for it by ensuring its effects are *random*, and therefore hopefully evenly distributed across conditions.

Necessary vs sufficient conditions

#### External validity
##### field experiment 
> the IV is manipulated in a natural setting out in the real world

#### Ethical + practical concerns
#### Describing + predicting behavior

#### Multiple methods
- No research method is a perfect test of a hypothesis
- Every method has some strengths and some weaknesses → the strengths of one method might well compensate for the weaknesses in another
