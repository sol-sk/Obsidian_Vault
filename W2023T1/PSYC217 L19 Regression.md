What do we need in order to predict someone's score on an outcome variable? 
- Relationship between two variables
- "point of origin"

#### Regression
##### **Extension of correlation** 
- both measure relationships among variables
##### **Important characteristics** 
- Key terms, not just variable 1 and 2: use score on one variable (**predictor**) to predict changes in another variable (**criterion**)
##### **Regression model** 
- Using a set of theoretically relevant predictors to predict a criterion variable 
- Can look at how 1 or more predictors can uniquely predict variability in criterion, amongst a set of predictors
##### **Correlation question**
- Is there a relationship between x and y
##### **Regression question**
- Can we use one's age of immigration to predict current identification with Canadian culture
##### - **Regression line: $Y= a + bX$**
- b = slope
- a = y intercept: when the predictor is 0, what is the value of the criterion? 
##### **To examine the contribution of multiple predictors: multiple regression equation**
- $Y = a + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + b_3X_3$
- $Y = 6.90 + .04(age of immigration) + .01(years in canada) + .02(height)$
	- Slope for each prediction is different
##### Multiple correlation coefficient R
- Multiple correlation R indicates the contribution of all predictors combined in predicting the criterion
- $R^2$ = proportion of variance in the Y variable which is accountable, predictable, or explained by variance on X axis

#### Partial Correlation
##### 3rd variable problem 
- Some other variable is responsible for the relationship between X & Y 
- Identify and statistically control for 3rd variable!
- 

### Summary
#### Measures of relationship
- Bivariate correlation: r
	- standardized index of how much 2 variables change w each other
- Squared correlation: r^2
	- proportion of variability shared by 2 variables
- Multiple regression
	- technique used when we want to test how well one or more predictors individually predict the criterion
- Multiple correlation: R
	- indexes how much a set of predictors when combined is related to the criterion
- Squared multiple correlation: R^2
	- Proportion of variability in criterion accounted for by set of predictors
- Partial correlation
	- correlation that removes effect of 3rd var
