## Reliability 

> True score + error of measurement = Person X's obtained score

### Test-retest reliability
> Do the scores line up? **Pearson correlation coefficient** 

Highest **positive** correlation coefficient

### Inter-rater reliability
> Evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient, amongst others
> Do people agree with each other? 

Behavioral coding
Content coding
Personality measures
Cohen's Kappa 
Coding: Prevents bias from one individual designing coding
### Internal consistency reliability
> Extent to which all items in questionnaire assess the same thing
> Evaluated using inter-item correlations (looking at correlations between each item) + Cronbach's alpha (combining inter-item correlations)


## Validity
### Construct Validity
6 different types of validity which comprise construct validity
> Does the content of the measure reflect the meaning of the construct? 
> How does this measure relate to other measures and behaviors? 

- **Face validity**: on its face, does this appear to measure our concept?
- **Content validity**: does the measure capture all the important parts of what the concept means/is (*and nothing more*)
- **Predictive validity**: predicts future, conceptually related, outcomes (do people with high scores in your measure go on to show other behaviors caused by the same high score?)
- **Concurrent validity**: related to relevant outcomes, assessed at the **same time** (do people with high scores behave in ways you expect them to behave if they were high in this construct?)
- **Convergent validity**: related to scores on other measures of the same/theoretically similar construct (high scores predict scores on theoretically related measures?)
- **Discriminant validity**: *not* related to what it shouldn't relate to 

**Example: Risk-taking measure**
4 different factors/components to risk-taking
- Thrill seeking
- Rebellious
- Reckless
- Antisocial

### External Validity
### Internal Validity
