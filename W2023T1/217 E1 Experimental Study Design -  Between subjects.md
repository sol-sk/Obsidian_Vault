### Experimental Study Design - Between subjects
Video game aggression example: 
	Testing aggressive tendencies after violent/non-violent game period = **Posttest-only design**
	Testing DV before and after IV manipulation = **Pretest-posttest design**
##### Pretest-posttest design
Example: 
	Framework: 
		Playing violent video games leads people to become more aggressive (builds on previous research)
	Hypothesis:
		After playing violent games rather than observing someone play violent games, one will be more aggressive
	Test groups before and after with aggressive trait checklist (aggressive thoughts and feelings)
	Prediction:
		Those who played the violent game would have higher aggressiveness/hostility scores than those who watched others play the violent game
	Pretest-posttest: 
		Allows researchers to see changes in scores due to IV
		Showing equivalence of groups in pretesting = more evidence to support claim that IV -> DV
