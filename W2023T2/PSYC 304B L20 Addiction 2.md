### Pre-class reading

### Lecture
#### Conditioned Withdrawal and Tolerance
- Brain gets conditioned to cues associated w/ drug taking → body compensates to prepare for more drugs

**Conditioned withdrawal**
> Go to drug context, don't take drugs
> Compensatory changes are not counteracted by drug

**Conditioned tolerance**
> Go to drug context, take drugs
> Body has prepared itself to counteract drug: tolerance


#### Principles of drug action
**Sensitization**
> When repeated exposure increases sensitivity to behavioural effects of drugs

**Amphetamine (AMPH)-induced locomotion**
- Locomotor response is much greater in px who received 5 days of AMPH than in px who gets 1 dose and then 4 days of saline![[Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 6.44.18 PM.png]]

***All drugs that have addictive potential can produce some sensitization***

#### Addiction
**Substance use disorder criteria**
1) *Habitual* drug use, despite adverse affects on social life and health
2) *Drug seeking behavior*: disproportionate amount of time spent craving and thinking about acquiring drug
3) *Physical dependence*: is there withdrawal (physical + emotional)

**Categorizing habit-forming drugs**
- Do they appear habit-forming
- Do animals self-administer drug
- Physical dependence

#### Marijuana
Low addictive potential 
- Cannabanoid receptors found all over brain (DA system, hipp., PFC, amyg, accumbens)
- Receptors discovered first, then neurotransmitter- <span style="color:#00b050">Anandamide</span> (hard to find, very fat soluble + stick to everything) 
	- Retrograde messenger
	- "Bliss"
	- Lots of intoxicating effects but we don't really know why
**Anandamide**
> Endogenous ligand, activates receptor → anan. inhibits presyn. transmitter release (floats out via diffusion ) → glutamate/GABA at presyn. terminal 

- Withdrawal symptoms are uncommon, but can occur
- Technically defined as a hallucinogen
	- Lower, social doses: incr. sense of well-being, dreamy state, altered sensory perceptions, incr. munchies (hypothal)
	- Higher doses: sensory disturbances, emotional intensification, impaired motor, cognitive, and speech processes
		- Can produce transient psychotic symptoms ie depersonalization, agitation, and paranoia

"Gateway drug!"

**Acute marijuana use**
- Affects cognitive functions + psychomotor performance 
	- Impaired performance for verbal, spatial, time estimation, and reaction-time
	- Interfere w all aspects of memory processing

**Chronic marijuana use**
- **Health effects**: basically impossible to overdose, but smoking may damage lungs, decr. T levels in men, impair immune resistance
- **Imaging studies**: some brain abnormalities
	- Associated w reduced activation in prefrontal/amyg regions in response to emotional faces–deficits in appropriately judging emotional and affective cues (?)

- THC has a number of medicinal effects (anti-nausea, analgesia, appetite stimulant, potentially anti-depressant)

#### Alcohol
- High addictive potential–oldest recreational/abused drug
- 2/3 of pop. consumes 10% become addicted
	- Biphasic action: lower doses = disinhibition, euphoria, relaxation 
	- W/ incr. amounts, slurred speech, disrupted motor. coordination, sedation, coma, death
- Depresses neural firing in multiple ways
	- Acts as a positive modulator for GABA receptors: allosteric modulator (like benzos, also not an agonist)
	- Reduces functioning of NMDA glutamate receptors
	- Blocks Ca and other ion channels in neurons 
	- Disrupts second messenger systems
		- ![[Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 7.31.23 PM.png]]
	- Low doses preferentially suppress firing of inhibitory interneurons, *disinhibt cortex*
	- Higher doses cause broader cortical inhibition
		- Alcohol increases DA release
		- <span style="color:#ffff00">Double check diagram for this</span> 

##### Hangovers and Withdrawal NOT ON EXAM
Incr. levels of *acetaldehyde* → hangover
- Headaches, nausea, cramps
- Can be sweated out
Also due to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, + **reduced opiod activity**
- Fatty/spicy foods can increase opioid release
Sleepiness due to suppression of REM
Withdrawal to alcohol: incr. sensitivity to bright light/sound, high BP, rapid heart rate, sweating, vomiting - can be offset w/ more alcohol

Lethal withdrawal sometimes

#### Nicotine
High addictive potential: from tobacco 
Stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, incr. neural activity
- Nicotinic receptors are on **DA neurons**, which underlies the addictive properties
Non-smokers: nausea, vomiting, coughing, sweating, abdominal crams, dizziness, flushing, diarrhea: way more stimulating
Smokers: less hungry, more alert, more relaxed
- tolerance to adverse effects develops while <span style="color:#ffff00">rewards</span> sensitize
Withdrawal: irritability, anxiety, restlessness, constipation, difficulty sleeping/concentrating, incr. appetite
Addictive properties of nicotine linked to administration route:
- Inhaling tobacco smoke causes rapid/pulsatile incr. 
- Nicotine patch causes gradual, sustained incr: less reinforcing

70% of people who try smoking become addicted
- Compared to 10% for alcohol/30% heroin
20% of quitting attempts are successful for less than 2 yrs

Positives of nicotine: 
- Improve attention/cognition in all subj. 
- Improves cognition in Alz./schz. px
- Decr. Parkinsons risk
