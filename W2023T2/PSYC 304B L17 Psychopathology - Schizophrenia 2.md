##### Treatment issues w Schz.
*Dopamine is involved in motor functions*

**Tardive Dyskinesia** 
- Occurs in 1/3 of px treated w classical antipsychotics

The more selective for dopamine a drug is → the worse the side effects 

##### Limitations of Dopamine Hypothesis
Antipsychs block dopamine instant, but *full* effects take 2 weeks to come
- May just take time for full effect, since there is a relatively fast decr in symptoms

Not all px respond to dopamine-blocking drugs
- 1/3 unresponsive to treatment
- If dopamine causes schz, they should always work

Dopamine blockers only alleviate psychosis
- Cog deficits and other neg. symptoms unaffected

Some drugs that reduce symptoms do not block D2 well
- <span style="color:#0070c0">Clozapine</span> (atypical antipsych)
	- Less likely to cause motor impedements
	- Much higher affinity for other receptors, like 5-HT (may be why it can improve neg symptoms)
	- Not safe for all px, can cause adverse reaction
- "Dirty" drugs best for schz. ("promiscuous" towards many receptors)

Drugs that increase dopamine can *improve* negative symptoms
- Working memory task: schz. px performed worse than controls *until given low dose amphetamine* → improved both control and px performance to **same level**

- Higher doses exacerbate symptoms

***If schz is j an increase in dopamine, why do dopamine-incr. drugs incr. cognition?*** 

Dopamine may be excessive in *striatum*, but not other parts of brain

##### Glutamate hypothesis
- Abuse of PCP, Ket, can cause psychotic symptoms and cog deficits that resemble schz. → block **NMDA-glutamate** receptors
	- Responsible for synaptic plasticity + normal functions
	- Block ion channel: glutamate can't activate receptor
- **Noncompetitive** NMDA antagonists 
	- PCP, Ket, go inside channel to physically block opening 

**Glutamate hypothesis**
- PFC, hipp use glutamate as transmitter → generation of glut. neurons in schz disrupts function

##### Animal models of schz
- Giving rats PCP induces cog deficits on PFC/working memory tasks
- BUT PCP also decreased PFC dopamine over time

##### **<span style="color:#00b050">Dopamine imbalance hypothesis</span>**
- Too much in striatum = psychosis
- Too little in PFC = negative symptoms/cognition impairments
- May explain why amphetamine (incr. dopamine) improved negative symptoms

##### PFC GABA Regulation of Cognition
- Reducing PFC GABA induces cognitive deficits resembling schz
	- Infuse low doses of bicuculline - GABA receptor blocker

##### Fear conditioning in Schz
- Highly comorbid w anxiety
- Inappropriate discriminative fear conditioning
	- More fear response to neutral stimulus than to stim conditioned with shock
- This <span style="color:#0070c0">aberrant salience attribution</span> may contribute to delusions

##### Salience Attribution: Rats
- Discrim fear conditioning: 
	- Pair one tone (CS+) with foot shock
	- Pair another tone (CS-) with no consequence
- Present neutral CS- tone: rats continue to press lever for food
- Present shock CS+ tone: rats stop pressing lever, freeze
**Does blocking GABA produce the same salience attribution as schz?** 
	→ Completely disrupted ability to associate stim: equally afraid of **both tones**: much more afraid of CS-, much less afraid of CS+

#### Integrative Hypotheses for Schz
- Decreased PFC dopamine/glutamate reduces activity, neg. sympotoms
- Noisy PFC (reduced GABA inhibition/incr. GABA) may contribute to cognitive dysfunction
- Increased subcortical dopamine transmission contributes to positive symptoms

**Takeaways:**
Schz. is not just attributable to one NT
Subtle changes over development can then alter subcortical dopamine transmission
Changes in separate brain regions underly diff symptoms
