**Confidence interval**
Our confidence in **parameter** estimates
Set by researcher, like $\alpha$
- Larger CI: more certainly contain pop. paramteres, but less practically useful, difficult to falsify

**When *t* = 1?**

**Conceptual steps to creating $CI_{x}$:
1. Determine total area under curve AUC that we're willling to be wrong
2. Split total AUC between 2 tails (for this class always 2 tail)
3. Visualize AUC/2 in upper lower tail
4. Determine val of *t* for AUC/2, using appropriate *df*

*s*/âˆšN = SE (reminder)

Sample problem: 
$s_\bar{X} * t_{.005} = 1.48$

If p val is **not** significant, CI should include 0
