##### 3a: Standard Deviation Review

##### 3b: The Normal Curve
- Symmetric
- Unimodal 
- Perfectly variable
68.2% of scores will fall within 1 SD of $\mu$
13.6% of scores will be $\mu-2\sigma$, 13.6% $\mu+2\sigma$ (27.2% will be exactly 2SD away)
2.3% of scores will be $\mu-3\sigma$, 2.3% $\mu+3\sigma$ (4.6% will be exactly 3SD away)

##### 3c: z-scores (a.k.a., standard scores)
**z score** 
$\frac{X_{i}-\mu}{\sigma}$
- how many $\sigma$s an observation is from $\mu$
z-scores *center* data: "standardizing"

##### 3d: Calculating a z-score from a Known Population
**Example: height**

##### 3e: Obtaining Percentile Ranks from z-scores
Height cont.
Can only use normal curve to obtain percentile rank when data is virtually identitcal to normal distribution
##### 3f: Comparing z-scores from different distributions
Math vs Psych grade
##### 3g: Obtaining Raw Scores from z-scores
Height cont.
