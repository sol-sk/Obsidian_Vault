### Lecture
**Background on readings**
##### "The Morale and Discipline of the Troops"
**Teaching by contraries: Positives**
- The Rebel Army | Vanguard (The Mountain | trajectory)
- Frank País (the City)
Need leadership in city / mountains

Fidel Castro 
- Castro is the *panopticon*
- Often mentioned in vague terms
- Che often calls out Fidel on failings
	- Ideological differences between them emerge soon after *Reminiscences* is published

**Teaching by contraries: Negatives**
- The Reinforcements
	- Mud as metaphor for grit: troops are clean
	- Troops are slow marching, esp. leader
- Batista's troops
	- Abandon their wounded
- Traitors: Eutimio Guerra ("Death of the Traitor")
	- Children are taken care of by the revolution: we will not desert the future of the country 
- Weak: Morán, the deserter

##### "Bitter Days"
"We lived with the feeling that we were constantly under siege" 
Asthma: suffering through

New recruits, new leader: what do we know about Fidel vs others? 

##### "The Reinforcements"
New, not yet battle hardened, compacted, prepared

##### "El Patojo"
trans. Shorty/kid
Sometimes this chapter appears as first following prologue; sometimes as last (as on marxists.org), or appendices, or even eliminated
- Spanish editions: either begins or ends the text
**El Patojo**
- Guatemalan (foreigner), dreamer, photographer, restless spirit, untrained guerrilla
	- Called upon by duty 
- Mirror to Che
	- Recommends to him "constant movement, absolute mistrust, eternal vigilance"
El Patojo dies because his troupe was not following these rules/not listening to those with experience

How do we learn from martyrs? 
- Che was captured and killed in Bolivia for same reasons El Patojo did
