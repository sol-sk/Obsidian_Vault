### Lecture
***Arlen Siu - Chinese-Nicaraguan Marxist-Feminist martyr*** 

##### The Mountain
- 119 - Tello's death 
- 126-7 - "So the mountain held fast ... been her son."

##### Mud
- Example of his unpreparedness; he becomes one with the mud 

##### Quixote
- Old man who goes crazy thinking he's a knight
- "If Che had not been a Quixote... the whole Frente was probably a Quixote"
	- You kids are going crazy reading all this theory and it is not real 
	- These books are teaching Uni students that it is possible to carry out a successful armed revolution; pipe dream
	- His role models die as a result of "dreamer's complex"
- 121
- *Fire* is published after the success of the Sandanistas, but Cabezas truly questions if revolution is even possible 

**Sickness - Cabezas' leprosy**

##### The *New Man*
Che vs Cabezas' New Man
**Che Guevara:** 
> “In this period of the building up of socialism, we can see the birth of the new man. His image is not yet finished; it could never be as the process goes hand in hand with the development of new economic structures … the important thing is that men {…} view their importance and necessity as the impetus for change {in the new socialist society}”. 

**Omar Cabezas:** 
> “The new man began to be born with fungal infections and with his feet oozing worms; the new man began to be born with loneliness and eaten alive by mosquitoes; he began to be born stinking. That’s the outer part, because inside, by dint of violent shocks day after day, the new man was being born with the freshness of the mountains. A man – it might seem incredible – but an open un-egotistical man, no longer petty – a tender man who sacrificed himself for others, who suffers when others suffer and who also laughs when others laugh”. (Fire from the Mountain)
- The *guerrilla* is already the new man 
- Homosociality & revolutionary love - very important to Cabezas' guerrillas

**Carlos Fonseca**
>  “The Sandinista is the most noble, generous, and sacrificial human being, the most likely to seek out difficult or impossible tasks {…} as the vanguard, he aspires to political and military perfection, which inspires him to carry out the most delicate missions because his triumphs will be destined to benefit only and exclusively, the people {…} The Sandinista is a revolutionary with great human morale; the most dedicated to the just cause of the people, his generosity is infinite; and above his individual interests, we find the collective interests represented by the vanguard and his political and military activity is guided by his political and ideological principles” (What is a Sandinista?, 1980)
- **Sandinista = New Man**


##### Nicaraguan Revolutionary Factions
Factionalized by class and geography
- **Proletarian Group (Jaime Wheelock Román)**
	- Marxist, unity of working class w/ poorer ones
	- City
- **Prolonged Popular War (GPP)**
	- To be like Che; Vanguard
	- Towards mountain
- **The Third Way**
	- Ortega
	- Ideological pluralism
	- Working class, peasants, indigenous, *inc. bourgeoisie* 
"Sandinista" is not a homogenous or even equal label 

##### Women in the Revolution
- Women suffered more than any other group during the Somoza Regime (1934-1979) (Randall 8). 
- For this reason, women took it upon themselves to participate in the revolution and re-structure society post-revolution. 
- Women made up 30% of the combatants in the Sandinista Revolution. 
- 60% of the volunteers in the literacy campaigns (during/post-revolution) were (bourgeois) women.
