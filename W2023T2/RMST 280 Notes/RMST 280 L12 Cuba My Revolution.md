### Lecture
*Reminiscences* wrap up 
- Practical + theoretical foundation for the guerrilla rebel + "*new man*" in socialist society
Guerrilla → New Man
1. The mountain: the ideal space of formation of the guerrilla rebel: suffering, collaboration, strategy
2. The Vanguard: a productive and "ignited" collective, guided by morale (ethical, heroic) and discipline (internal, external)
3. The Socialist State: access to the means of protection and human necessity; capacity to inform, educate, and implement change– *transitional protectorate of the people*
4. The New Man: The ideal human being that will continue to transform and adapt along with socialist society

Forming new society means changing the people in society

*Socialism and Man in Cuba* (1965)
- Che is interested in the *transitional* stage 
- Written and published in March, 1965 just one year after Che had left Cuba to "test out" his guerrilla warfare from Africa → *The African Dream*
- Model Cuban Rev. for other countries

Theoretical foundations: 
Marxism
- Dialectical materialism and class antagonism: the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles
- Revolution as the most radical expression of civil rights
Leninism
- Create the conditions necessary for the revolution *now*, use socialism as transition to communism
Marxism-Leninism
- Revolution as a two-stage process that involves the formation and recognition of the vanguard (catalyst for change), centralized “democracy,” and the dictatorship of the proletariat
Che wants to take part in the first stage of revolution, but not the second
Castro establishes dictatorship of the proletariat

Socialism (Che)
- "The protector of the proletariat"
- A transitional social state between the Overthrow of Capitalism and the Realization of Communism.
