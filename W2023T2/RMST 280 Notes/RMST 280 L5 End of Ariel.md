Enduring of a *truly great* (not only enormous, opulent, just) civilization; dependent on *spirituality*
- A city is strong and beautiful when its days are more than the unvarying repetiiotn of a single echo circling and circling in an eternal spiral; when there is something in it that rises above the crowd; when among the lamps it lights by night is the vessel that accompanies the solitary wakefulness incited by thought, the vigil that incubates the idea that at the dawn is born as the cry that summons and the strength that leads human souls." (92)
thought must reign
"gospel of delicacy/gospel of intelligence/gospel of selflessness"

Future: looking beyond tomorrow
"We are capable of progess only to the degree that we become capable of adapting our acts to conditions that are increasingly distant from us in space and time. The certainty that we are contributing to work that will survive us, work that will benefit the future, enhances our sense of human dignity, helping us to triumph over the limitations of our nature."
