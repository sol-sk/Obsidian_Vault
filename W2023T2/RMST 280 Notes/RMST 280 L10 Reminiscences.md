### Lecture
##### Prologue
> I do not wish that this fragmentary history, based on memories and a few hasty notes, should be regarded as a full account. On the contrary, I hope that those who lived through each event will further elaborate.

> I ask only that such a narrator be strictly truthful.

False modesty

Why should we trust Che writing here? 

##### Caution reading *Reminiscences*
- Fragmented first person account
- Written post-victory 
	- Dissenters were executed
- Che is the face of *transcontinental* revolution
- Che is very well read: rhetorical skill

**Emotional appeal to reader**
- But not complaining/whining

**Hero's tale**

Builds up peasant groups
- Comradery 

Revolutionary, theoretical ideals brought through practicality (not by name)

Testimonial; but very cognizant of the purpose of book, marketing, readership

*False modesty → teaching by contraries → hindsight, moral*
 - Ellipses, hyperbole
 -
