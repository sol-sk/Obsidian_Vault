#### Ariel
How to connect mind and spirit to bring most benefit to society: utilitarianism in a truer sense than american capitalist false-utilitarianism

Pessimism = paradoxical optimism bc impetus for change

Youth = reason + spirit 

**The parable of the Hospitable King**
- "His palace was the home of all his people" (45)
- his generosity extended to both the hapless and the inanimate
- Inner chamber where never was there such peace

Old Testament, Ishmael: Inclusion / exclusion, hospitality / exile
Orpheus / St. Francis of Assisi: infinite embrace / acceptance of all things

Moral of story: 
- Hospitality / egoism
- External / internal 
- Theory / right
- Leisure / work
- Beauty / vulgarity

Working for money (capitalist) versus *thinking for intellectual and societal benefit*
>  The stupefaction of the savage, when confronted with the tools and products of civilzation, is no greater than the amazement of a relatively larger number of cultivated men when they witness behavior that gives serious weight to what is beautiful in life
>  49

Knowing how to use tools is as important as thinking about those tools: thought and action are of equal importance
