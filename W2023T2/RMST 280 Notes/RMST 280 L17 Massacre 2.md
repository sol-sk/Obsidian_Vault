**Democracy**

#### PRI: The "perfect dictatorship"
![[Screenshot 2024-02-28 at 12.12.48 PM.png]]
- Constitution = marker for "democracy"
- PNR → Party of mexican rev (PMR) → Institutional revolutionary party (PMR, renamed) → Mexican Dirty war (begins mexico involvement in cold war) → NAFTA
- US installs Mexico's rulers

"I don't believe that there has been in LatAm any case of a system of dictatorship which has so efficiently recruited the intellctual milieu, bribing it with great subtlety. The perfect dictatorship is a camouflaged dictatorship."

Key groups: 
- PRI (institutional revolutionary party)
- CNH (strike committee)
- IPN (university)
- UNAM (university)
- ESIME (riot police)

Testimony of witnesses-tenants, students, organizers, police, army members, generals

Poniatowska = facilitator, interviewer, compiler

Octavio Paz = intro, leftist bckgd

##### Alegoría de una Matanza *Allegory of a Massacre*
- Political cartoonist Abel Quezada 
- Excelsior publication (left leaning in 60s) publishes this illustration; a completely black canvas
- Cost of ink 
- Palimpsest: a manuscript or piece of writing material on which the original writing has been effaced to make room for later writing but of which traces remain.
- La noche de tlaltelolco– The night, pitch black

##### Framing the testimonials
- Poniatowska frames the testimonials – p.199
	- Anaphora: repetition– "This is *their* story, woven out of *their* words, *their* struggles, *their* mistakes, *their* pain, and *their* bewilderment at the turn events took."
	- “In these pages there echo *the cries* of those Who died and *the cries* of those who lived on after them. These pages express their outrage and their protest: *the mute cry* that stuck in thousands of throats, the blind grief in thousands of horror stricken eyes on October 2, 1968, the night of Tlatelolco” 
	- Dates/names: real, historiography

#### Investigations
- Fragmentation brings together contradicting narratives; allows us to best see full story 
- Who are the victims? Who are the villains? 
- Undercover army; pretend that civilians were shooting
- Dirty War; completely unequal, both in arms and narrative; news articles
- Olimpia battalion
- Confusion; where is there consensus? 
	- Many people died, imprisoned; # unknown 
	- The flares initiated the shooting
- What was the motive? 
	- "Terror? Insecurity? Anger? Fear Of losing face? Ill-will toward youngsters who deliberately misbehave in front of visitors” (207)? "
- Railway support for students; strikes planned for day after protest
-
