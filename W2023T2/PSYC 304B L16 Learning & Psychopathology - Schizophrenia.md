#### Schizophrenia
PFC dysfunction

###### Defining Schizophrenia
- Symptoms first compiled by **Kraeplein** as *dementia praecox* (early dementia)
- Later recategorized by **Bleuler** as *schizophrenia* (split mind)
- *Family of disorders* - not just one 
- **<span style="color:#0070c0">Positive symptoms</span>** (psychosis): hallucinations (typically auditory), delusions
- **<span style="color:#0070c0">Negative symptoms</span>** (cognitive deficits): blunted emotional response, poverty of speech, social withdrawal, anhedonia, lack of insight

##### Diagnostic criteria
- at least 1 <span style="color:#0070c0">positive</span> symptom
	- Symptoms can vary *significantly*–positive symptoms can also be due to epilepsy, drug use, brain damage, tumor–if these are ruled out, schizophrenia can be considered
	- Most common symptom: *lack of insight into illness*
	- Sensory overload; lack of perceptual organization/attention to particular stimuli → information becomes part of delusion 
	- Verbal hallucinations can be inability to distinguish internal monologue from other dialogue, doesn't have to be "heard" 
- 1% of population, same prevalence cross-cultures
	- Onset typically after puberty
	- Typically does not onset after 30 in men, some women develop symptoms after menopause
	- No notable sex difference
	- Sometimes there are pre-puberty signs but not full symptoms

##### Cognitive abnormalities
- Cognitive functioning is #1 predictor of long term outcome (better function = better prognosis)
- Many impaired functions are mediated by PFC

###### Brain activation studies
Twin study: one schizophrenic twin
- Schizophrenic individuals showed less PFC activation *both* at rest *and* during wisconsin card sorting task than non-schizophrenic 
	- No other brain regions differed
	- Schizophrenic patient performance was similar to px with PFC damage

##### Genetics of Schizophrenia
- Odds increase if a relative has been diagnosed: highest concordance between identical twins or if both patients have schizophrenia → 50% chance
	- Not all genetics, otherwise it would be 100% between identical twins
- Different genetic abnormalities can cause schizophrenia; no one gene 
- Adoption studies

##### Neural Development
In utero influences: 
- Poor nutrition during pregnancy 
- Premature birth/low birth rate
- Physical or immune stressors during pregnancy 
	- Mothers who had flu during pregnancy; children more likely to be schizophrenic
Lifetime influences: 
- Early developmental insults → brain abnormalities in adulthood
- Post-puberty stressors can trigger onset
- Genetics increase sensitivity; susceptible but not immediately symptomatic
	- Cannabis? Can trigger onset if used, but requires susceptibility 
- Living in city can be risk factor

##### Neural structures
- Some px have enlarged lateral ventricles due to <span style="color:#0070c0">smaller</span> <span style="color:#0070c0">hippocampus</span> and other <span style="color:#0070c0">temporal</span> <span style="color:#0070c0">lobe</span> regions
	- Altered *organization* of hippocampal neurons in px brains
- Not brain damage per se; changes in neural organizaiton can disrupt how brain regions process info 
PFC: 
- *Pyramidal* neurons have reduced number of dendrites→ decr. processing power 
- Hypofrontality (reduced PFC function) is a characteristic negative symptom 

GABAergic interneurons:
- serve as info filter for PFC + hipp. 
- Px. have reduced GABAergic interneurons in these regions → "noisy" cortex, impairing function

##### Dopamine
Ventral midbrain produces most of dopamine
1950s: 
- Chlorpromazine–antipsychotic, causes Parkinson's symptoms in healthy individuals (makes sense bc parkinsons = low dop.)
1960s:
- Cocaine, amphetamines which increase dopamine can cause psychotic symptoms
- Chlorpromazine found to block dop. receptors
1970s: 
- Dopamine receptor subtypes discovered: antipsychotic potency correlates w blocking <span style="color:#0070c0">D2</span> receptors (D1 blockers don't help)
**<span style="color:#0070c0">Dopamine</span> <span style="color:#0070c0">hypothesis</span>:**
**Schizophrenia is caused by an abnormal incr. in dopamine transmission leading to overstimulation of D2 receptors**

Support for dopamine hypothesis:
- All drugs that are affective in treating psychosis block D2 receptors to a degree
- More D2? -  inconclusive
- More dopamine release? 
	- Study: imaging of dopamine release
	- Give amphetamine to those w schz. or controls: *more dopamine release from **striatum** in those w schz.*
	- More dopamine release correlated w positive symptoms induced by amphetamine

**But what's that extra dopamine *doing*?**
- DA neurons show incr. activity to novel/salient stim. 
	- Incr. in activity → signal brain to determine what's important/relevant
- Hyperactive DA system may tag normally irrelevant stimuli and impair filtering of irrelevant stim. → <span style="color:#0070c0">aberrant salience attribution</span> that may contribute to delusions
	- Meds reduce this aberrant salience by reducing DA activity
- Often, px. still experience hallucinations on meds but are no longer bothered by them
