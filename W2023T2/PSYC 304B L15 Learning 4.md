### Lecture
(last slide)
**"Tower of London" task**
Assesses planning ability: can you move balls in your head before trying to solve?
PFC patients need many more moves, & if complex: don't reach goal at all 

**Dinner party problem:** 
Could access episodic memory of being told what to do, but couldn't implement while executing tasks 

- PFC: coordinates efficiency, focus, inhibits distraction, as well as shifting focus (Wisconsin cards: can't stop doing old thing)
