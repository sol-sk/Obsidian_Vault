Benefits of acute stress; detriments of long term/chronic cortisol  

SNS: 
- projections from brain stim. **adrenal medulla** → adr. release
- Rapid response incr. HR, respiration, vasoconst., pupil dilate
- Blood flow incr to prep muscles for activity (oxygen, glucose)
HPA: 
- Limbic regions (sensory input) signal HTh → HTh releases CRH to pituitary → pituitary releases ACTH to bloodstream → adrenal cortex releases glucocorticoid (in humans = primarily cortisol)
- Cort: incr. glucose metab, decr. inflammation (desensitize to pain), reorg. energy use: enhance cell glucose use

Chronic stress: 
- Inability to process glucose efficiently 
- Exercise can help reduce consequences

Immune system: 
HPA suppresses immune response, takes energy
- Chronic stress reduces B and T cells
- Can be observed after
	- Severe stress: maternal separation, electric shock
	- Moderate: social 
	- Mild: exam 
- Ulcers due to reduced immune capacity–bacteria present in many ppl but chronically stressed are more susceptible 
- Experiment: rats that lose aggr. interactions (chronic social stress) lose beta cells
