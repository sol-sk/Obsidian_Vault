### Lecture

We eat to *maintain energy levels*
##### Energy
**Energy use:** 
- Basal metabolism – 60% of energy use
	- Maintains body heat, resting functions
	- Vary w/ body weight
- Active behavioural processes – 25% 
- Digestion – 15%
	- Vary by type of food
** note: textbook numbers refer to lab animals

##### Nutrients
**Basic nutrients**
- Carbs
	- 4cal per gram, all converted to glucose → primary fuel for body → stored as glycogen in liver, muscles
- Amino acids
	- 4cal per gram, from protein → basic building block for all cells
	- 20 amino acids, 9 of which need (essentials) to be from diet 
	- Can be converted to glucose
- Lipids
	- 9cal per gram, long term energy source
	- Fats → free fatty acids, alternate energy source for most cells of body 
- Vitamins and minerals
	- needed to assist in bodily functions; digestion, cell building, homeostasis, etc. 

##### Digestion
**Steps of Digestion**
1. Chewing (mastication)
2. Saliva (lubrication, *salivary amylase* → breaks down carbs, to get them to bloodstream asap)
3. Swallowing
4. Stomach (storage and breakdown, HCl, Pepsin)
	1. High protein, fat may stay in stomach for 3, 4 hours
5. Duodenum (absorption)
6. Gall bladder + pancreas
	1. Break down into nutrients, free fatty acids, aminos, glucose
7. Bile: fats
8. Remaining water and electrolytes absorbed by large intestine or pooped out
9. *6-7 hours after meal*: nutrients enter bloodstream
10. Whole process takes 18-24 hours

##### **Glucose regulation**
Pancreas: <span style="color:#ffff00">regulates</span> blood glucose lvls
- Glucagon: converts glycogen (stored carbs, in muscles) → glucose
- Insulin
Alpha cells detect low blood sugar levels, release glucagon
Beta cells detect high lvls, release insulin

**Insulin**
2 primary actions
- Promotes use of glucose as primary energy source
	- *Most cells need insulin to get glucose into cells*
- **Brain does not need insulin to use glucose, but it can *only* use glucose**
- Converts bloodborne fuels to storable forms
	- Glucose → glycogen (muscles/liver),
	- Glucose + fatty acids → body fat
	- Amino acids → protein (muscles)
Mechanisms of insulin release: 
- Brain (via vagus): *thinking* about eating → insulin release pre-feeding: **cephalic phase**
- Hormones released by gut: **digestive phase** (stomach communicating that food has arrived)
- Nutrients entering bloodstream: **absorptive phase**

##### Diabetes
*Diabetes Mellitus*: Type 1 diabetes
- Pancreas stops producing insulin, excess glucose in blood stream 
- Brain can't use it all: cells start using fatty acids bc it can't use glucose
- Leads to unsatiating eating, paradoxical weight loss
	- Brain sees lack of glucose → hunger → still no glucose

**Satiety?**
- Insulin and glucose work together for satiety but not whole picture

**Hunger?**
- Set point theory: low energy = hunger
	- Genetics, env. play role in establishing set point
- Against set point:
	- Evolutionary: eat as much as you can, so set point doesn't make sense
	- Drinking high caloric bevs. doesn't reduce eating much
	- Significant fluctuations in blood sugar or body fat are rare
	- Taste of food, social factors influence eating
- Positive incentive theory
	- We crave the good feeling that food gives!
	- Similar to sexual behavior
- No one factor is **the** motivation to eat

**What we eat**
- Conditioned taste aversion: negative association with food
- Learn to eat foods that have minerals/vitamins you need
	- Too many choices (10) was too many for the rat to tell which one had the B1 it needed, but it could between 2 foods

**When we eat**
- Pavlovian conditioning: feeding + tone 
	- Even if rat is full, hearing the associated tone triggers hunger
 Study: provide rats w/unlimited food- monitor glucose levels • Blood glucose levels remain constant through day except… • Glucose levels drop ~10% before feeding is initiated • However, it is unlikely that drop in glucose is directly responsible for feeding because: • If food taken away (no meal) = glucose levels return to previous homeostatic levels in about 10-15 min. 
 Meal  Changes in glucose levels may contribute to feelings of hunger, but does not seem to be the main controller of eating behavior
