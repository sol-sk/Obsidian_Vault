### Lecture
Critical period of devpmt: 7-15 weeks in utero 
- If T present: male development, if not, female development

#### Alternative sexual development

**Androgen insensitivity syndrome**
> No functional androgen receptors
> No effect of T during development
> Testis form but remain internal
> Mullerian duct atrophy (AMH from testes); no ovaries, Wolffian ducts (grown by T) do not develop
> Female external genitals develop
> During puberty, estrogens → secondary sex characteristics
- No period (no ovaries)
- No body hair (regulated by testosterone)
- Typically does not affect gender identity

**Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia/Androgenital Syndrome**
- Normally, fetal adrenals produce cortisol, which *inhibits T release* from adrenal glands 
- Some fetuses don’t produce enough cortisol = **more T effect on fetus**
- Wolffian and Mullerian ducts **both** grow → external genitalia are intersex
- Affects gender identity

#### Rat sexual behavior
- Sexual encounter begins with female, who ovulates every 4-5 days
1. Female displays proceptive behaviors (darting, hopping, ear wiggling)
2. Male mounts receptive female
3. *Lordosis*: Female arches back, moves tail to one side
4. *Intromit*: insertion of penis
5. Rpeat 2-4 until male ejaculates

**Sexually stereotyped behaviors**
- Females: lordosis, darting, hopping ear wiggling
- Males: mounting, etc 

These behaviors are primary reduct for determining gender-lean of brain: index changes in male/female sexual development 

#### Hormonal regulation of sexual behavior
**Organizational effects**
> changes in body/brain during development

Permanent
Exerted during *critical periods* (utero, puberty)

**Activational effects**
> behavior *after* development

Occur after puberty (adulthood)
Transient and vary with amt of hormones in bloodstream
Effects take several days to occur and to abate: steroids slow

#### Neural sexual development in rats
Development of parts of rat brain for sexual behavior occur for *days after birth*
- Makes research much easier
Sexual brain development regulated by presence or absence of T
No androgens: female neural development

**Altering male sexual behavior**
If male castrated in 1st week after birth: no male sexual behavior
- T therapy in adulthood does not reinstate male-like behaviors
- Exogenous E to adult male rat causes lordosis/female-like behavior
If rats castrated *after puberty*: T therapy will work, E therapy will not

**Altering female sexual behavior**
Giving testosterone during 1st week after birth: defeminizes + masculinzed sexual behavior
- T given again during adulthood → male sexual behavior
- *Not observed if T is **not** given during 1st week* 
Giving extra estrogen to neonatal female **also** causes male patterns of behavior in adulthood

##### The Aromatization Hypothesis
T is converted into estradiol by aromatase enzyme
Male rat fetuses release T → brain converts to **estradiol** → activation of estradiol receptors → **masculinization**

**Why don't mother's estrogens masculinize all fetuses?**
In rats:
- $a$-Fetoprotein is in blood of male and female neonates; "sponge" for estradiol 
- Does not bind to androgens → T can enter brain and be converted, activate estradiol receptors, masculinization occurs

When exogenous E is given to female rats, it overloads the a-Feto and allows E to masculinize brain 

Blocking aromatase or E receptors in neonates disrupts masculinizing effects of T

Female a-Feto knockout mice show more male behavior

DHT cannot be converted to E; has **no masculinizing effects** when given during neonatal development 

#### Neural sexual devep. in primates
SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin), not a-Feto, is responsible for blocking E to brain 
Impossible to surgically castrate fetus in utero/neonatal phase

E *or* DHT treatment in pregnant primates **can** masculinize female infant (unlike rats)
Some synthetic Es which are not blocked by SHBG can masculinize primate brain

Less distinction in behavior compared to rats
- Longer gestation
- Can't chronically treat pregnant primate w exog. hormones

##### Preoptic Area (POA) of Hypothalamus
Lesions to area disrupt sexual behavior
**SDN (sexually dimorphic nucleus) of POA larger in males than females**
T injections in female neonates → bigger nucleus
Castration of male → smaller
Selective lesions of SDN do not have major impact on sexual behavior
