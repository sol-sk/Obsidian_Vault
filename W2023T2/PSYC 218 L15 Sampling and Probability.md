### Pre-class reading
Chapter 8 [[Robert R. Pagano - Understanding Statistics in the Behavioral Sciences-Wadsworth Publishing (2012).pdf]]
### Lecture
Flipped class: [Videos](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/132566/pages/week-5-sampling-and-probability?module_item_id=6473682)

##### Why sample? 
- Save time and expense
- Ensure accuracy of measurement
- Ensure quality/durability 
Sample must be **representative** for valid generalizations to be made

#### Sampling procedures
1. **Self-selection**: volunteer participants
	1. Efficient / Often unrepresentative
2. **Quota sampling**: technique sets groups and their proportions to sample from 
	1. Less efficient, limited by ignorance of the importance/quantity of each group, biased towards prototypical example of group
3. **Random sampling**: every person has equal chance of participating
	1. Nearly impossible, very inefficient, but fully representative

**Replacement**: can the same case be selected twice? 
- Sampling with vs without replacement: with, can sample case more than once

### Probability
**Dependent successive events**
Probability of being dealt 2 kings ("Cowboys") = 4/52 * 3/51 = 12/2652 
- 3/51 bc no replacement
Probability of being dealt a matching pair = 12/2652(13) = .0588

Or, 1 (probability of being dealt any card) x 3/51 (probability of being dealt a matching card) = .0588

Probability of being dealt 2 hearts = .0588
.235
