Ch 1-2 [[Robert R. Pagano - Understanding Statistics in the Behavioral Sciences-Wadsworth Publishing (2012).pdf]]
**Methods of knowing**
> Authority
> Rationalism
> Intuition
> Scientific method; uses reasoning and intuition + *objective assessment*

Observational studies
* (1) naturalistic observation
* (2) parameter estimation
* (3) correlational studies
True experiments
- Determine causality

Types of scales

SPSS introduction

### Lecture
**Sample**
> Subset of all cases
> Described by *sample statistics*
> Example: sample mean

Serve as "best guess" for what is happening in population

**Population**
> Complete set of all cases (virtually never worked with)
> Described by *parameters*
> Example: population mean

**Descriptive statistics**
> Seek to understand what patterns exist in collected sample

**Inferential statistics**
> Seek to infer whether patterns generalize to population
> Often quantify confidence; will sample pattern show up in pop.? 

**Margin of error**: SD x constant

#### Measurement scales
**Nominal**
> Most restrictive
> eg. religion
> *count things that are alike*

**Ordinal**
> Ranked, but interval between values may not be equal 
> eg. 1st 2nd 3rd place in election
> *compare and order things*

**Interval**
> Ranked with equal intervals
> eg. days of month
> *add and subtract*

**Ratio**
> 0 is possible and meaningful
> eg. reaction time
> *calculate ratios*

**Discrete vs Continuous variables**
> Discrete: have no possible fraction values
> Continuous can have infinite fractional values (and are *always approximate*)

**Sig figs**
Report means, SD to 2 or 3 decimal places
Report correlation/regression coefficients, test-statistics, p-vals to 3 decimal places
