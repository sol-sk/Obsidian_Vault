**Did they cheat?**
Hypothesis 1 ($H_1$): 
- Assuming they have not studied, student performs no better than they did on exam 1 (20%)
Hypothesis 2 ($H_2$): 
- Student cheated

Or: is our assumption that they didn't study wrong? 

N = 20 questions
$P_{expectation} = .20$
$P_{observed} = .90$
- Student got 18 correct, but 19 and 20 correct would be even stronger evidence against $H_1$
Compute p(18) and add to p(19) & p(20): <span style="color:#0070c0">tail of distribution</span>
p(18) + p(19) + p(20)

**Will they get an A?**
N = 50 
- Textbook table only goes up to 20! **<span style="color:#0070c0">Normal distribution</span>**
Need to get 40 right
P = .70 
- Chance of getting question right >.20; student studied
What z-score corresponds to 80% score? 
$z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$
- $\mu = NP$, $\sigma = \sqrt{NPQ}$
X = 40
$\mu$ = expected score = 35
$\sigma$ = possible variability in score
z = 1.54 (6.8% chance)

**Conceptual steps for Normal Approximation**
1. Want to know p(â‰¥80%)
2. Binomial approximates z-dist
3. z-score that corresponds to 80%
4. What is area under curve for this z-score or higher?
