#### Final review
$R^2_{adj}$; correction for $R^2$, which is upwardly biased (always incr. w more predictors)

$H_0$ predicts $\mu$: $\mu_{D} = 0$ is the expectation of the null hypothesis (no difference between populations)
- D = diff. 

How does lowering $\alpha$ from .05 to .01 affect power? *Decreases*

$z_{crit}$ does not depend on sample size

F dist values are always positive

Why do we take square root of denom in t obt? bc. it's SD

Paired t-test: 
for d_z: why do we divide by $s_D$ instead of âˆšN?
- That gives us *t*
- Here, we are looking for difference btwn values
