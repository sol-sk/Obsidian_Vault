### Pre-class reading

### Lecture
- Contrast Pearson $r$ and Spearman $r_s$
- Review models in context of psych processes 
- Describe goal of statistical inference

#### Pearson v Spearman
Pearson's r assumes
- Equal intervals
- Normal distribution of X & Y
- Absence of multivariate outliers
- Linear relationship X~Y
- *If assumptions violated, model may be biased*

Spearman $r_s$ assumes: 
- *Ranked data*
- Normal distribution unnecessary
- Multivariate outliers are OKish
- Monotonic relationship X~Y, but not necessarily linear
**Advantages:**
- RObust to non-normal data (skewed) outliers
- Model non-linear
**Disadvantages**: 
- If X & Y have equal intervals, ranking loses information
- If X & Y are normally distributed, Spearman $r_s$ is less powerful (may fail to find true relationship)

**Example: spearman_demo.omv**

Shaded figure around model: *standard error of model*

If the mean can shift enough that it would flip the result, we are *unconfident*
