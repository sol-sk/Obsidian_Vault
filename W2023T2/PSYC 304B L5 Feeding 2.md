#### Hunger
Eating= stress on body
	Fluctuations in blood glucose levels = anticipatory insulin response from pancreas 
	May influence hunger, but is primarily preparatory rather than inciting hunger

Our eating behavior; high calorie foods we eat less of than low calorie, brain keeps track 

#### Satiety
##### **Sham eating experiment**

Rat esophagus disconnected from stomach: how much will it eat? 
- Familiar food; rats eat same amt as before surgery (about 10g per sitting)
- Novel food; eat 3x more food; same caloric value but brain has no measure for caloric value 
- Rats try to eat more of familiar food at 2nd, 3rd tests once they realize they don't feel full
- Eventually give up; other cues stop them from continuing to eat 

**Social: eat more when around others**
- People take "bites" together 


**Sensory Specific Satiety:** 
Humans and animals take in more calories if they are given varied (cafeteria, buffet) diet *(dessert stomach)*
- Satiety can be taste specific: new taste = more consumption 
- Encourages consumption of varied diets and to take advantage when different foods are abundant 
- Study: humans asked to rate palatability of 8 foods, then given one of foods for meal 
- When asked again to rate same 8 foods, one they just ate got lower rating: when given new meal right after, they ate more.


#### Physiology of Hunger and Satiety 
- Liver can signal brain about what’s in the bloodstream via **vagus nerve** 
- Liver receives blood from small intestine; has **detectors** for glucose and fatty acids inside some cells 

**Experiment: inject chemicals that “trick” liver to act as if glucose/fat levels are low**
- 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) = competes with glucose for absorption, but doesn’t activate glucose detectors – *liver thinks there is no glucose* → **increase in feeding**
- Methyl palmoxirate = disrupts metabolism of fatty acids 
- Inject these drugs into vein from intestine → liver = immediate increase in feeding 
	- Cut vagus nerve = abolish effect of drug injection 

- Note: brain also has receptors for glucose (but not fats) in a number of regions. 
	- Infusing 2-DG in certain brain regions also stimulates feeding

##### Body to brain 
- Body uses multiple hormones to signal brain to start/stop eating 
- Food in gut, glucose in blood can initiate signals that suppress hunger before food is fully digested 
	- From Stomach: CCK (digestion of fat + protein), bombesin, somatostatin (high protein foods)
	- From Liver: detects changes in blood glucose, direct input to brain via vagus nerve (non-hormonal) 
	- From Pancreas: Insulin 
	- From Intestines: PYY3-36 & GLP-1 
	- From Fat Cells: Leptin, gives continuous feedback on body’s energy stores 
		- Removal of fat gets rid of this satiety signal, increases hunger 
		- Fat removal surgery can trigger body to increase satiety to reestablish previous levels – easier on body to gradually change
	- Other peptides can stimulate feeding 
		- From Stomach: Ghrelin, levels remain high

**Ventromedial Hypothalamus: Satiety center?** 
- Lesion this nucleus, animals become obese 
	- Starts with massive consumption that achieves new weight (dynamic phase) then maintenance of that weight (static phase) 
	- Interpretation issues: Animals reach a new target weight (2-3x orig. body weight), but do eventually stop eating in a session 
	- Rats become *fussy eaters* 
		- Give rats less palatable food, VMH lesioned rats show minimal weight gain
	- Reinterpretation: VMH regulates **energy metabolism**, not eating. 
	- VMH lesions increase insulin levels (which increases lipogenesis (fat formation) and decreases breakdown of body fat into usable forms)
		- Increased insulin levels was *causing* increased eating
		- Neurons in VMH may not be what causes effects. These lesions also destroy axons projecting from the **paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus.** Lesions of these fibers alone *also* produce hyperphagia and obesity.

In summary: VMH lesions initially thought to disrupt satiety → VMH regulates satiety. But, VMH lesioned rats: resettled at new goal weight, became picky eaters. VMH then thought to regulate metabolism. Found VMH lesion → increased insulin, which caused increased eating. Lesions to axons from paraventricular nuclei caused same effects: VMH lesions had been destroying these projecting axons as well. 


Lateral Hypothalamus: Hunger center? 
- Lesion caused rats to stop eating (**aphagia**) 
	- Interpretation issues: force feed rats for a week, they eventually start eating again 
	- Reinterpretation: **LH lesions cause wide range of sensory and motor disturbances, including decreased appetite. Animals have problems with eating, but not lack of hunger.** 
- Control of hunger and satiety is distributed across many brain regions 
	- Other hypothalamic subregions, as well as amygdala, frontal cortex are also involved

**Feeding behavior is distributed across many regions, with redundancies**

**Arcuate Nucleus of Hypothalamus: First-pass appetite control center** 
- 5 main Satiety/Hunger hormone signals from body interact with this nucleus to regulate feeding 
	- ***How you feel/behave is based on what direction the balance is leaning between diff hormones***
- Pancreas: Insulin ($\downarrow$ feeding) 
- Fat Cells: Leptin ($\downarrow$ feeding) 
- Intestines: GLP1 & PYY3-36 ($\downarrow$ feeding) 
- Stomach: Ghrelin ($\uparrow$ feeding) 
	- If there is no digestion happening → ghrelin (empty stomach)
- These activate different types of neurons in arcurate nucleus, (defined by transmitters they use or proteins they express) 
- Neuropeptide Y (NPY) & agouti-related peptide (AgRP) 
	- Activation of these cells $\uparrow$ appetite 
	- Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) & Cocaine/Amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) 
		- Activation of these cells $\downarrow$ appetite

Image 1. Long term appetite control
- Leptin & Insulin work as long term modulators of appetite: always in bloodstream
- Activate POMC/CART neurons and inhibit AgRP/NPY neurons 
- POMC/CART neurons *inhibit* lateral hypothalamus (LH) using the transmitter $\alpha$-**melanocyte stimulating hormone** ("alpha-mush")
Image 2. Short term appetite increase during fasting
- Ghrelin released by stomach when empty, stimulates AgRP/NPY neurons that do 2 things: 
	- *Inhibits* PVN cells using the transmitter NPY 
	- *Release* AgRP in LH, and this *blocks $\alpha$-MSH inhibition* (acts as an antagonist on these receptors) → $\uparrow$ LH activity
Image 3. Short term appetite decrease 
- PYY & GLP1 released from intestines in response to meal 
	- PYY inhibits AgRP/NPY neurons, which disinhibits (i.e.; increases) PVN activity 
	- GLP 1 stimulates POMC/CART neurons, which inhibits LH activity

**Summary of feeding cycle:** 
- (stasis) $\alpha$-MSH inhibits LH → inhibits appetite
- (before meal) Ghrelin → stimulates AgRP/NPY → inhibit PVN cells, blocks $\alpha$-MSH → $\uparrow$ LH → increases appetite
- (after meal) PYY → inhibits AgRP/NPY → disinhibits/increases PVN 
- GLP 1 → stimulates POMC/CART neurons → inhibits LH 

Regions activated by **cues** associated with feeding; *Pavlovian conditioning regions*
- Prefrontal cortex 
- Amygdala 
- Both send signal to LH → $\uparrow$  increased appetite 

- **Arcuate nucleus circuitry can be bypassed by food-associated cues** 
- Rats given food + cue that predicts foods delivery 
- Present cues in sated rats, they eat more (Pavlovian conditioned feeding) →  
	- Lesions to prefrontal cortex or amygdala, or disconnection of the amygdala-LH pathway abolishes **conditioned** increases in feeding 
- NOTE: *NORMAL feeding patterns unaffected by these lesions.* 
- These lesions only disrupt cue-induced feeding
