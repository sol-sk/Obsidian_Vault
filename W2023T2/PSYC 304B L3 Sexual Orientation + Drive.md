#### Brain differences; LGBT
**Sexual Orientation** 
- Vast majority of researchers agree that sexual orientation (hetro/ homosexuality) is determined early in development, and is due to biological factors 
	- Near impossible to rule out social factors, but no firm evidence suggests this plays a major role 
- Prevalence difficult to determine, but in Western countries, typically ranges between 2-10% 
- Genetics: Males= 52% of monozygotic, 22% of dizygotic twins both homosexual. 
	- There may be a gene near the end of the X-chromosome (Xq28) that influences male sexual orientation. 
- Females = 46% monozygotic, 16% dizygotic are homosexual. 

Homosexuality has genetic predictability: identical twins more likely to both be gay than fraternal 

Length of ring finger indicates fetal androgen exposure; lesbians tend to have longer ring finger (compared to heterosexual woman), indicating male hormone exposure

Mothers taking E supp.s → daughters "more amenable" to gay encounters

Gay people more likely to be left handed

Men with more older brothers are more likely to be gay
- Women carrying male fetus may generate antibodies that change brain development

**Simon LeVay**
 A study by Simon LeVay showed region of the anterior hypothalamus (3 rd interstitial nucleus) is larger in hetero- vs homosexual males (heterosexual females closest in size to homosexual males)
- *Study done in late 80s: size difference due to AIDS?*
- Has been replicated since, so seems like no 
**Researching homosexuality: Homophobia** 
- Public funding for research requires taxpayer; many oppose this use of $ 
- (or) Using research to find "cure"

More recent imaging studies suggest some anatomical differences in brain structures in hetro- vs homosexual men and women 

Other studies have shown differences in brain connectivity between homosexual vs transgender individuals
- Trans differences: Cerebral cortex differences, relating to self/proprioception
- Gay differences: Subcortical regions (basic instincts)

#### Activational effects of hormones: Rats
##### Male sex behavior
![[Screenshot 2024-01-16 at 10.04.34 AM.png]]
Removing T effects (castration, drugs) eventually reduces sex drive (you need SOME T) 
- Effects of hormonal fluctuation take *weeks*
- Replacement T brings sex drive back to normal levels

However, relative sex drive and T levels are uncorrelated in normal males. T injections do not increase sex drives 
- (males have more than 10 times what they need); reducing T by up to 90% would not decrease sexual activity

**Guinea pig experiment**
- Rated “sexual activity” of males (ranked as Low, Medium and High Groups).
	- "studs, slugs, and duds"
- Castrated all males, then monitored sexual activity. 
- All males THEN receive same large dose of testosterone injections. (*higher than their normal level of T*)
	- The (large) test dose of T restored all males to PREVIOUS level of sex drive.
- **Conclusion: OTHER FACTORS control individual differences in sex drive** 
	- SOME T is necessary, but more T does not mean more sex drive

**Neural Regulation of Male Sex Behaviour** 
- Sufficient levels of T in bloodstream, “primes” certain brain regions to make them receptive to sexual stimuli 
- In males, T is converted to an estrogen in brain, and stimulates *mPOA, medial amygdala* thru *E receptors*
When estrogens prime these sites, they can response to sexual stimuli 
- Olfactory signals go though medial amygdala, then to mPOA 
- mPOA signals ventral midbrain → motor centers → spinal cord

*Evidence for Testosterone/Estradiol regulation of male sexual behavior* 
1) **mPOA/medial amygdala lesions disrupt sexual behaviour (but NOT sexual motivaton)** 
2) mPOA electrical stimulation initiates sexual behaviour (even in slug or dud or refractory period)
3) in **castrated males** – administration of T (or estradiol) into just the mPOA reinstates sexual behaviour → more likely to engage in mounting 

* **Androgens gets these brain regions ready to act in response to sexual stimuli. Do not cause behaviour, but are necessary for it** 
* Example of an *activational effect* of hormones on sexual behavior


##### Female sex behavior

Estrocycle (as opposed to menstrual cycle, + much shorter)
- In female rats, estradiol increases ~ 2 days before ovulation 
	- One effect is that this causes brain to make progesterone receptors 
- Progesterone then starts to increase 
- When both peak, ovulation occurs: at this point, female is fertile and shows sexually stereotyped behaviours 
- Both estrogens and progesterone increasing in this order is required for these events to occur

Hormonal fluctuations also correlate with circadian rhythm 

![[Screenshot 2024-01-16 at 10.27.05 AM.png]]
- Th**e ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) monitors changes in hormonal levels**
	- Estradiol increase → VMH neurons alter dendrites & make progesterone receptors → structural changes in VMH
	- Stimulation of progesterone receptors causes VMH cells to produce proteins necessary for lordosis 
	- Changes in VMH makes these downstream nuclei more excitable
- Eventually, signals output through spinal cord, and promote lordosis in response to stimulation from mounting

*Evidence for estradiol regulation of female sexual behavior:*
1) VMH/PAG lesions disrupt lordosis 
2) implantation of estrogens into VMH reinstates lordosis in ovarectomized females 
- This pathway is for particular motor program. Other sexual/maternal behaviours are mediated by other, more complicated brain circuits. 
- **Again, hormones do not cause behaviour, but are necessary for it.**

#### Human sexual behavior
##### Female sexual behavior
Estrogens: 
- Human female sexual motivation/ behavior may or may not be as tightly linked to estrogens released during menstrual cycle. 
	- HUMAN females are different from most other mammals in this respect 
- *Ovariectomy does not have reliable effects on sexual motivation/behavior.* 

Androgens: 
- Testosterone levels can correlate with measures of sexual motivation. 
- Following ovariectomy, replacement injections of testosterone (not estradiol), rekindles sexual motivation

**Menstrual Cycle**
![[Screenshot 2024-01-16 at 10.32.42 AM.png]]
- Women DO SHOW some changes in sexual behaviour patterns during menstrual cycle 
- Greater probability of having intercourse and achieving orgasm as ovulation approaches 
- *Other, more subtle changes in behaviour also occur during ovulation….*
Study: Stink 
- Male partners wear and get BO on t-shirt, 
- During rest of cycle: female partners prefer partner
- During ovulation: female partners prefer stranger :o 

Study: Austrian discotheques
- Do women wear more revealing clothing when they are ovulating? Apparently yes
- Positive correlation between amount of skin showing and T levels
