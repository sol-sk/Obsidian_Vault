Pinker discusses a phenomenon that is incompatible with word-chain devices (or at least not possible to capture in a simple and elegant way). This phenomenon has to do with the way the words of a sentence depend on each other. Which of the following sentences exemplify this phenomenon?
- The cat ate my favourite little goldfish.
- <span style="color:#00b050">The cat that I really like ate the goldfish.</span>
- The goldfish ate my favourite little cat.
- <span style="color:#00b050">Either the cat ate the goldfish or the goldfish ate the cat.</span>
