#### Cultural evolution
**Individual learning**
- learning without reliance on other individ. 
- trial and error, sci. discovery
**Social learning**
- learning that involves reliance on others
- imitation, explicit instruction
- <span style="color:#ffff00">Product of lots of individ. discoveries</span>
***Lifetime knowledge: both***
- Only individ; very limited 
- Only social, no progress, just same facts over and over 

Both individ and social learning are biologically costly
- big brain (instead of muscles)
- time spent learning/doing R&D (instead of gathering)
- prosociality (sharing food, helping others)
How is social learning adaptive? 

Speed of adaptation: 
- Biological adaptation relies on generational turnover
	- If environmental changes are relatively slow, biological adaptation can keep up 
	- If env. changes are too fast, can't keep up → **cultural adaptation!** (ie. changing clothes to respond to rapid weather changes)
	- If env. change is incredibly rapid, adaptation is impossible

Brain size relative to body size correlates pos. w/ social learning + indiv learning across species
- Increases in brain size relative to body size in diff mammalian lineages over 14 mill years 
- Increases in env variability (ie climate/ice age) over same period 
- but correlation ≠ causation

Now discounted theory: adaptive adv. of social learning
- indiv learning can be very costly (ie discovering what's edible)
- social learning less costly
- in a variable env the fitness advantage conferred by social learning decr as # of indiv learners falls
	- too much social learning = not enough indiv generation

Social learning becomes less and less useful over time as social knowledge incr., until point at which there aren't enough indiv.; equilibrium point where neither have advantage over other

<span style="color:#ffff00">Social learning can only increase avg fitness of a pop if it allows the accumulation of behaviors that no indiv could acquire in their lifetime</span> 
→ must have mutually reinforcing relationship w indiv learning
