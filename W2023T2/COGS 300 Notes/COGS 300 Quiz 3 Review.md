##### Question 1
The graph below shows a neural network that takes pixel intensities as its input (on the left). Each blue circle is an artificial neuron, while the connections are shown in blue. The neurons on the output layer correspond to digits (1–5). Which of the descriptors below apply to this network? There may be 1 to 3 correct descriptors – the number of points you can get for this exercise does not correlate with the number of correct answers.

##### Question 5
An experiment is run where participants are asked to rate the extent to which different images convey a positive feeling. Participants are assigned to two conditions: in condition A they rate the images while performing a positively valenced action (pushing upward on a table from below), while in condition B they rate the images while performing a negatively valenced action (pushing downward on a tabletop). Participants in condition A rate the pictures more positively than participants in condition B. The researchers use these results to argue that motor behaviours can influence attitude formation.
