**Why is cultural evo (mostly) unique to humans?** â†’ <span style="color:#00b050">"True" imitation</span>, <span style="color:#0070c0">theory of mind</span>, <span style="color:#ffff00">symbolic communication</span>

##### Imitation
Children predisposed to copy, even if they're copying wrong action -- chimps don't, so they appear to be doing better 
- scenario 1: 
	- modest degree of social learning individuals hang around others who have discovered e.g. a new means to extract food (e.g. cracking nuts); more likely to rediscover the same adaptive behaviour 
- scenario 2: 
	- true imitation individuals learn directly from other individuals, and can build atop their innovations (e.g. devise a more efficient method for cracking nuts)

##### Theory of mind
- Asking children if snoopy knows what's in the box even if he didn't see it. 
- Everybody sees what I see and thinks how I think

*4 y/o develops theory of mind*

##### Symbolic communication 
- certain concepts can only be learned by communication ie. "the vacuum of space will kill you in a matter of minutes" 

*costly cognitive capacities!*

##### Costly information hypothesis
- When maximally accurate info is costly to acquire, evolution favours the extraction of (potentially less accurate) info from other members of group 
- Content vs context biases

**Model based biases**
- Prestige & success bias 
	- Ability to rank indiv in terms of success observed in other species, but not to *selectively learn from indiv.*
	- Challenges: 
		- Teasing apart random variation from true success
		- Determining what makes him successful 
- Conformity biases
	- Majority behavior is typically more efficient
