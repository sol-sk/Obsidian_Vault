#### Emergence & Self organization 
> I view the brain not as a box with compartments that contain sadness, joy, color, texture, and all the other "objects" and categories that one might think of. Instead, I envisage it as a constantly shifting dynamic system; more like the flow of a river in which patterns emerge and disappear, than a static landscape. "Meaningful patterns," as Sherrington said, "but never abiding ones." This is an entirely different image from the brain as a computer with stored contents or subroutines to be called up by a program. In nature's pattern-forming systems, contents aren't contained anywhere but are revealed only by the dynamics. Form and content are thus inextricably connected and can't ever be separated.

Order emerges thru local interactions between parts of a system without control of an active agent

Individ rules → applied at large → pattern emerges

Moguls on ski hills formed from same motion + behavior direction repetitively; path formation
- Winding paths necessary for skiing (turns) → kickback, compression → indentation 
- No overarching control; individual skiiers control own actions but can't control formation of moguls


**Positive Feedback Loops**
- Given event makes the recurrence of that event more likely
**Negative Feedback Loop**
- Given event makes the recurrence of that event less likely 

**Combination → Predation, Population**

**Control vs order parameters**
- Each cell can decide to keep or change color based on majority rule
	- Based on ratio required to change color pattern changes
	- Parameters → patterns
- Control parameter: something that can be manipulated/change
- Order parameter: is affected by control parameter

##### Terminology of dynamic analysis
**Open non-equilibrium systems**
- Open: exchanging energy/matter/info w/ env. 
- Non-equilibrium: without external output, system collapses
- Phase transitions: config 1 → config 2

**Rayleigh-Bénard instability**
**eg. heating oil** 
- Open system 
- Heated molecules want to rise: contact with cool air causes sink → circular motion, *convection cells*
- *Preferred states*
	- Weak heat: no pattern/movement is stable state
	- Strong heat: **instability**, system wants to roll (in one direction or the other, random but does not change once started)
		- Unstable bc pattern will stop w/o continuous heat
		- *Collective effect*: pattern is property of multiple molecule interaction

*q* = order parameter (large graph: y axis, other graphs: x axis)
- Here: amplitude of convection rolls
R (or V) = control parameter 
- Once certain point is reached → bifurcation
Dot = stable states w/in landscape
**Adaptive landscapes**
