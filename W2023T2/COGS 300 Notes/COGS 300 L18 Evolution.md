**Evolution:** 
- Regards individuals & their genes– not species
##### The replicator 
**<span style="color:#00b050">Things necessary for evolution</span>**
- Molecule floating around: When it floats by the right kind of molecule & it attches, continue till full copy, break apart, do it again
- Able to make copies of itself → exponential growth 
- But...
- <span style="color:#00b050">Limited longevity</span> - perfect copies that last forever = no evolution
- <span style="color:#00b050">Finite resources</span> - w/o → no competition 
- <span style="color:#00b050">Copying w/ errors</span> → variety
- Replicator types: if one is more effective it'll out compete others

##### Evolution
- Variation introduced through copying
- Competition among different types of replicators
- Three ways to outcompete others: 
	- Faster reproduction
	- Higher longevity
	- More faithful copying: too many mutants → not reserving your replicator type 
- **Fitness**: most numerous replicators will be ones who are best at reproducing selves

Weapons: replicators can destroy other replicator types

"**Selfish**" replicators in evolution– from pov of evolution, all replicators care about is replicating themselves
- Maximize own type
- Replicators are more about type than individuals 

**Replicators vs. vehicles; genotype vs. phenotype**
- Replicators with more successful vehicles will outcompete replicators with less successful vehicles; vehicles are what are "doing the competing"
- "arms races" – positive feedback → leads to development of complex structures

**"Replicators" conceptually:** 
- Cultural ideas as replicators - religion, ideas, memes
	- Some ideas are better at replicating than others
	- suicide cults??? 

**Single celled organisms: Precambrian - Archean era**
- Cognition?: Yes, has behaviors, responds, but.. ? 
- Is a nervous system necessary for cognition? 

**Multicellular organisms: Precambrian - Proterozoic era**
- Colonies of multiple cells
- Not complex enough to have better cognition than archean

***Ediacaran*: origins of the nervous system**
- "Nerve ref(?)" - organized, distributed across the body

**Nerve nets in Cnidarians**

How is the nervous system advantageous from the POV of a replicator? 

***Cambrian/Ediacaran* origins of bilateria**
- Bilateral → CNS only exists in bilateral animals
- Simple brains!

Most parts of human-like brains already in place by *Permian* 

##### Evolution of Human Cognition
- Tricky to study
- reliance on indirect evidence
	- brain size lol 
	- allometric growth; size of brain to body ratio → can make educated guesses about cognition of species
	- products of brain: **tools** - complexity shows cognition
	- comparisons with close relatives, but parallel evolution, and closest live relatives separated from us 7 Mya

#### Heyes (2012)
##### 2 alt. views of human cogn. evolution:
- Swiss army-knife (traditional)
	- Encapsulated
	- Specialized
	- Evolved for specific purposes
- "New thinking"
	- integrated
	- domain-general
	- more complex evo. history
Which is the same kind of debate as ...
##### Language
**Pinker:** 
- innate langauge module
- separate linguistic operations
- linguistic knowledge unique
- linguistic modules evolved for specific purposes
Highlighting differences from other communication systems - MERGE (lang is result of mutation that allows for recursion and other higher level complexity)

**Tomasello:**
- non-modular, integrated, lang. relying on domain general mechanisms
- evo. in tandem with other abilities
Highlighting continuity (eg. gestural vocal systems in other mammals) - gradual evo. of language

##### Coevolutionary processes crucial to cogn. evo. 
1. Techno-social coevolution
- Loop between tool use and social organization 
- Coevolved:
	More effective tools 
	→ allows incr. social organization (to use the tools), high level specialization, division of tasks 
	→ development of more tools, refinement of existing ones ... 
	→ more effective tools etc. 

2. Gene-culture coevolution
- Non-cogn. example: lactose tolerance / milk production 

**Cultural evolution:**
- study of the evo. of cultural products such as tool use, language, art
- eg. cumulative cultural adaptation
