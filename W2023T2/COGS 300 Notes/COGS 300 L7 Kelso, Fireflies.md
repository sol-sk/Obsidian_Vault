### Lecture
Finger wagging; easier to perform symmetrical than asymmetrical movements, esp. at higher speeds
- Order parameter: phasing relationship
- Control parameter: speed

Termites
- Way more complicated nest than their intelligence level would suggest 
- Chewed mud puts pheremones into walls of nest
- Deposit mud balls in locations that have more - positive feedback loop

Fireflies
- Synchronize light flashing w/ artificial light
- Algorithm designed to describe flashing: rising, falling
	- 100-200 millisecond delay from excitation to flash, excitation resets after flash
	- Flash during excitation build: *resets* to zero in order to synchronize
	- Early reset during falling phase speeds up cycle to synchronize
