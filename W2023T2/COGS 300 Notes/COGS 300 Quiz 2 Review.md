##### Question 4
The Xs and Os in each of the following four plots are data points in a two-dimensional coordinate system that represent contrasting categories.

Let's assume you train single-layer perceptrons to accurately categorise data points as X or O based only on their coordinates. Let's also assume that you train and test the perceptrons using only the data points in the plots. Which of the four patterns are definitely **not** learnable by a single-layer perceptron? A pattern is defined as "learnable" in this context if the perceptron can categorise the data points with 100% accuracy after training.
