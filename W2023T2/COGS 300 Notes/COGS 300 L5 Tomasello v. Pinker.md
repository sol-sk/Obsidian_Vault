> First, I argue that although many people bandy about rather loosely the notion of an innate language module, ***the oniy theoretically coherent version of such a module that has ever been proposed is that of Generative Grammar***-in which resides a priori the theoretically-specific linguistic structures of Universal Grammar. This and only this is Pinker’s “language instinct.” Second, I argue that this view of language and its development, though coherent, is wrong. All of the most important lines of evidence that Pinker’s new book adduces for an innate Universal Grammar are also compatible with a less rigidly nativistic view of language acquisition in which there is a biological foundation for language, just not in the form of specific linguistic structures preformed in the human genome. Finally, I argue that there is an alternative linguistic theory, or group of theories, that should be especially attractive to cognitive developmentalists because they are much more compatible with what is known about development in other domains of human cognition. (133)

> Generative Grammar takes as its model of natural language formal languages such as mathematics and propositional logic. From this original metaphor, everything else in the theory flows. Most important, in formal languages the distinction between syntax and semantics is absolute and rigorously maintained (134)

> The issue, then, is not whether human beings are biologically prepared for language acquisition; they are. The issue is whether human beings come into the world equipped with an innate linguistic module that contains from the outset adult linguistic structures of the Generative Grammar kind. (137)

> Universality is just as consistent with a view in which human beings all over the world are faced with similar communicative problems and have similar cognitive and physical re- sources with which to solve them. Bates’ (1984a) well-known analogy is that all human beings eat mostly with their hands, but that does not mean that there is an eating-with-the-hands gene (137)

> Modularity is very often the result of developmental processes, not their cause. In this view, instead of being seen as an innate encapsulated module already containing its adult structures, language may be seen as “a new machine made out of old parts” that becomes modularized and localized in the brain as ontogeny proceeds (144)

>  If children’s analogizing is not based on abstract linguistic symbols but rather on concrete words and semantically based classes of words, then we would never expect the errors that Generative Grammarians hypothesize as “logical.” (145)

> The major opposition in language is not between syntax and semantics, but between linguistic symbols and their meanings: **signifiers and signifieds**, forms and functions, symbols and meanings. Within the signifier/form/symbol pole, we may then distinguish between different types of linguistic signs, for example, lexical, morphological, and syntactic. Within the signified/function/meaning pole we may distinguish between semantic and pragmatic functions. (149)

> For Cognitive and Functional linguists, the creativity of language comes from the tendency of human beings to create categories in their language, (150)

> All groups of human beings have certain experiences they wish to communicate to others and have evolved the ability to use conventional symbols to do so. All groups of human beings have the ability to categorize these symbols and form combinations of them, and to extract schematic patterns of those combinations involving hierarchical organization. All groups of human beings engage in certain forms of social interaction and attention directing. All groups of human beings have the same vocal-auditory channel, which requires them to communicate their experiences by expressing symbols linearly, one at a time. 
> Given these “constraints,” all groups of human beings have at their disposal some combination of four and only four linguistic devices for communicating experience: individual symbols (lexical items), markers on symbols (grammatical morphology), ordering patterns of symbols (word order), and prosodic variations of speech (e.g., stress, intonation) (Bates & MacWhinney, 1982). (150)

> None of this is to deny that language skills may become more modularized during development, as do many domains of cognition (Karmiloff- Smith, 1992). But this developmental fact does not negate the phylogenetic and ontogenetic roots of language in such things as the basic cognitive processes involved in the understanding of event structures (Nelson, 1985, 1986) and on children’s growing understanding of the intentions of adults, including their linguistic intentions (Tomasello, in press;Tomasello, Kruger, & Ratner, 1993). (151)

> At heart, Chomskyan nativism is a philosophical endeavor language is Not an Instinct 153 to discern by means of logic what is uniquely and innately human. Cogni- tive and Functional approaches are scientific endeavors aimed at under- standing how people learn and use natural languages (153)
### Lecture
(L4 cont.)
##### Chomsky Hierarchy
- Word chain devices don't have memory: will generate ungrammatical sentences bc. they don't remember previous word choice (keep track of previous dependencies)

##### Elaborating our PSS
**X-bar theory**
- Template that all phrases in any language conform to 
- Pinker says this is *innate*: language acquisition = figuring out how lang. realises these meta-rules

***Disclaimer***: Principles + parameters approach to grammar is no longer mainstream in syntax

**Innateness, weak version**: language relies on species-specific, genetically coded cognitive and physiological features that are present (though not necessarily expressed) in humans from birth
- **Descended larynx**

**Modularity**: 
- The language faculty = an “organ” whose internal representations & processes are domain-specific and is informationally encapsulated (i.e. does not need to continuously refer to other cognitive systems to operate) 
- evidence: 
	- uniqueness of structures (no parallels to phrase- structure outside of language?) 
	- double dissociations (general cognitive deficits do not necessarily affect language and vice versa) 

**Innateness, strong version**: 
- Language relies on a modular language faculty that is species-specific, genetically coded and is present (though not necessarily expressed) in humans from birth

#### Tomasello
Arguments against innateness
- universality of languages 
	- We are just all using our shared tools to fulfill shared needs
- univerally present/species-specificity ≠ genetic coding
- language universals
	- are they actually? 
	- english centric

 
 Arguments against modularity
 - domain-specific representations (chess connection)
 - double dissociation
	 - Linguistic savants: do have issues in multiple areas of language production
	 - specific language impairment: is it truly specific? 
	 - Brain localization can change w/o genetic encoding
	 - Localizaiton: Broca's, Wernicke's area: close to where auditory nerve connects to brain
