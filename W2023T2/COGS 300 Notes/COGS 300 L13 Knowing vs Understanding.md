### Lecture
What does it mean to *understand* speech? → Understanding in LLMs
- Repetition ≠ understanding
- Aid understanding through *analogy*

**Phonemes and Allophones**
- Allophone = specific realization of abstract unit (phoneme)
- /p/: can be realized in different ways in speech
	- $p^h, p, p^7$
	- pat = /$p^h$/
	- spat = /$p$/
	- Cutting off /s/ from spat sounds like bat because the p is unaspirated
- Allophones are in complementary distribution to each other
