### Lecture
**Overview of "Debunking"**
ChatGPTs existence already presents a challenge to Chomsky's ideas of language: learning a language and understanding its grammar without having any real understanding of semantics or having the generative restrictions (and strengths) that language typically has–
- i) Language should be generative of every possible sentence
- ii) within that language only and fitting within the restrictions of its grammar

### Big Ideas in Cognitive Science
#### Foundations of Cognitive Science
**Behaviorism** - early 20th c
- Psychology is an experimental science
- "Extreme" version: stimulus/reinforcement is the *sole* method of language acquisition
- This is core issue: rejects the "mind" as part of study; all psych is stim-response + conditioning (cf. linguistic structuralism)
- Mind as "middle man" between stim-behavior

Is it dead? Chomsky says it "keeps coming back" despite being refuted countless times

**Computation** → **Representation**
- Birth of computing machines: computation (~ cognition / thought) as a physically fully specified and implemented process
- Turing machine (theorized and then later implemented in the 40s)
- **Cogntition as physically implemented process**
- **Cognition as operation of computational processes on representations**
	- Negation of behaviorism, focusing on the mind between stim-behavior
- De-abstracting

Parallel development of programming languages and models of cognition

**Neural networks**
- Computations inspired by brain 
Two false starts:
- Perceptron
- Parallal distributed processing
Deep neural networks
- Do their own pattern recognition
- Multiple hidden layers
- Siri, google translate, self-driving cars, 
- ChatGPT, Dall-E
- Primarily applied, but informing theory 

**Extended mind**
Cognition is beyond brain: relies on tools
- Physical: calculator, pen + paper, etc. 
- Behavioral: language, sketching, visualization

**Cultural evolution**
- Cognitive tools and culture are the products of a long process of cultural evolution
	- Cumulative cultural evolution
- Features of cultural evolution may explain many properties of cognition that were previously attributed directly to the brain
	- Some features of language, cognition may be innate, or due to shaping by cultural evolution
