##### Question 2

##### Question 3


##### Question 6
Let's make the following assumptions relating to the proportion of social vs. individual learners in a population:

1. A learner can either be an individual learner or a social learner, but not both.
2. Social learning is more beneficial than individual learning when the proportion of individual learners is high, but less beneficial than individual learning when the proportion of individual learners is low.
3. At proportion P of social learners, the fitness benefits of social learning are the same as those of individual learning.
4. The fitness benefits of individual learning do not change as a function of the proportion of social vs. individual learners.
Which statement follows from these assumptions?
