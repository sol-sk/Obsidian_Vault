##### Iterated learning
- Errorful transmission → cultural evolution
- Stereotypically, parent to child 
- Transmission gets more stable in later generations (fewer changes)
	- Features that are harder to transmit get weeded out quickly
	- Features that are easier to transmit = *higher fitness*
- **Transmission error**: the difference between two adjacent generations at a given point in the transmission chain 
	- Transmission error != the overall amount of distortion between the first vs. last generation

##### Kirby et al (2008)
Language is far older than writing, w/ no fossilized remains → create artificial language to see how it evolves

Participants were English speakers
Word corresponds to particular shape with distinct movement pattern

Some words were not shown in training → task becomes impossible
- How do they change language when they can't fully transmit from one gen. to next

<span style="color:#0070c0">Transmission error</span> goes down w gen: <span style="color:#00b050">structure</span> (correlation between meaning & form) goes up
- Participants did not know they were "training" next person (their inputs for results to task would be fed to next)

→ Systematic underspecification: collapsing word distinctions in a systematic way (all spiralling obj. = "poi")

Next experiment; if words were repeated they would be eliminated from training set

→ compositionality: the component parts of a word are descriptive and specific (prefix = color, suffix = movement, middle syllable= shape)
