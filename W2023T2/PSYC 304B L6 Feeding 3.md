Ch 13 
### Lecture

##### Serotonin (5-HT)
- Raphe nucleus
- SSRIs/Prozac = 5-HT agonists/releasers
- Send axons to sleep, emotion regulation, feeding regions
- $\uparrow$ sero. → satiety, less feeding
	- Reduces amount of food consumed per meal, even when presented w "cafeteria" (variety)
	- Doesn't cause fewer meals (like amphetamines do)
	- Shift preference away from high fat/caloric foods 
- 5-HT inhibits release of NPY in PVN of hypoth.→ disinhibits PVN, promotes satiety
- Fenfluoromine popular weight loss drug acting thru serotonin increase

##### Anorexia nervosa
- 1% of population, mostly women
- BW less than 75% of expected weight required for diagnosis
- Anorexic individuals show larger than typical insulin spike when shown food-related stimuli; *hyperresponsive*
- Present in recorded history; even when societal norm for women was for less skinny body 
- Few effective treatments; 10% of affected die by suicide or starvation, less than 30% show long term recovery 
	- Difficult to study bc you can't make a rat anorexic

**Underlying causes**
- Positive-incentive value for food goes up during starvation
- Meals disruptive to body; over-avoidance → even stronger disruption, discomfort
	- Refeeding syndrome
- Forced meals (+ above disruption) → conditioned taste aversions  

**Biological mechanisms**
- Imaging studies allow research into anorexia
- Food related stimuli 
	- → abnormal increases in amygdala (to palatable tastes eg. choc. milk), abnormal patterns of frontal activation
- Lvls of AgRP, NPY, leptin (feeding transmitters, hormones) $\downarrow$
	- Leptin may be compensatory to weight loss
- 5-HT abnormalities (could be bc/ of depression comorbidity)

##### Obesity
Males: >25%, Females > 30% BF
1/4 canadian adults, 1/10 children 
BMI > 30 
- US twin study: env. and genetic factors equally responsible
- Larger insulin response to sight, sound, smell of food
	- Brain + pancreas have over-storing mechanisms
- Binge eating
- Metabolic differences

**Treatments**
- Exercise + diet
- Crash dieting bad
- Appetite suppressants, surgery: wiring jaw, gastric bypass/balloon
- **GLP-1 agonists: Ozempic**
	- Activates GLP-1 receptors: released by intenstines to promote satiety: fake satiety signal 
	- Ozempic developed as T2 diabetes treatment bc it helps reg. insulin lvls

##### Why is it so difficult to lose weight? (NOT ON EXAM)
- Food intake $\downarrow$ → metabolism $\downarrow$
- Most people put weight back after dieting
- Low fat diets compensated for w carbs
	- Low fat diet promoted by sugar industry
- Exercise helps but a lot of it is necessary
	- 1 lb fat = ~3500 cal
	- We eat more when active
	- Many factors can trigger hunger, irrespective of what we "need"
	- We eat a lot of sugar lately

#### Exam information 
***Only lecture slides***
Dont need to know: 
- Chapter 12: NOT responsible for ”Pheromones Guide Reproductive Behaviorand “Parental Care” section 
- Chapter 13: NOT responsible for “Temperature Regulation” of “Fluid Regulation” sections (but all of sections 13.4, 13.5, 13.6)

Tips: 
- Know your brain circuits/hormonal cascades/pathways/drug effects • The majority of questions are on topics that are covered in both textbook AND lectures 
	- ~85% of the marks can be obtained from information that was covered in both the lectures and textbook (the remainder, just from the lecture notes)
