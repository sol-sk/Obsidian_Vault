### Pre-class reading
Ch 3-4 [[Robert R. Pagano - Understanding Statistics in the Behavioral Sciences-Wadsworth Publishing (2012).pdf]]
**Frequency distribution**
- Relative: proportion of total number of scores that occurs in each interval 
- Cumulative: number of scores that fall below the upper real limit of each interval 
- Cumulative percentage: percentage of scores that fall below the upper real limit of each interval

#### Measures of central tendency
**Mean**
Properties of the mean
- sensitive to exact value of all scores in dist. 
- the sum of the deviations about the mean = 0 (the deviations above the mean are equal to the deviations below)
- sensitive to extreme scores
- sum of squared deviations of all the scores about their mean is a *minimum* (the smallest possible sum of squared deviations about any value)
- usually, the mean is the least subject to sampling variation compared ot other measures of central tendency
Overall mean
- If we know separate group means we can sum and divide by *n* to find the overall mean
**Median**
- Centermost score if n is odd, average between centermost scores if n is even
- less sensitive than mean to extreme scores
- more subject to sampling variability than mean but less than mode
**Mode**
- most frequent score in dist

**Standard deviation**
$\bar{X}$ = mean of sample 
μ = mean of population

Deviation score for sample data = $X - \bar{X}$
Deviation score for population data = $X~~–~~μ$

### Lecture
**Outliers**
- Highly atypical observations
How do we deal? 
- Use *median* instead 
- Compare mean with & without outliers → does pattern of data change
- Determine source of outlier - is it measurement error or legit? 
- In certain cases you can preemptively reject outliers as (in the case of reaction time) they may be a result of irrelevant psych. processes

Robustness/insensitivity to outliers & skew: 
- Mode > median > mean
Robustness to sampling variability
- Mean > median > mode


#### Models of variability
3 models:
1. Range 
2. Standard Deviation s, σ, std, s.d. 
3. Variance $s^2$, $σ^2$, var

**Deviation score: $X_{i} - \bar{X}$** 
eg. Trix deviation score = 12 ($X_{trix}$) - 6.8 ($\bar{X}$) 

**Summed deviation scores**: $\sum (X_{i}-\bar{X})$
