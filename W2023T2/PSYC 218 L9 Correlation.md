Calculating Pearson's r: 
- Check that relationship is linear (scatterplot)
- Variables are normally distributed
- Interval or ratio data
- Absence of extreme outliers
From z-scores: 
$r = \frac{\sum z_{x}z_{y}}{N-1}$

Most r values in psych research are 0.10-0.30

Coefficient of determination: $r^2$
r = relatedness, covariance
$r^2$ = explained variance
