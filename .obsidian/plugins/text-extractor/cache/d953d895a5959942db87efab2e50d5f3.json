Online embodiment Oﬄine embodiment Cognition depending on sensorimotor areas of the brain in tasks that do not have a strong sensorimotor component. Love Hate Slow Fast but: see Rotteveel et al. (2015) 4 Oﬄine embodiment Love Sensorimotor cortex 5 Oﬄine embodiment Love Sensorimotor cortex 6 Oﬄine embodiment Love Sensorimotor cortex 7 Oﬄine embodiment Love Sensorimotor cortex 8 Oﬄine embodiment Love Sensorimotor cortex 9 Oﬄine embodiment Love Sensorimotor cortex 10 Constitutive vs. causal embodiment Constitutive embodiment Causal embodiment Cognition interacts with the body (but the task can be achieved without that interaction). Love Hate Slow Fast Cognition crucially depends on the body. but: see Rotteveel et al. (2015) 11 Cognition crucially depends on the body. Constitutive embodiment Causal embodiment Cognition interacts with the body (but the task can be achieved without that interaction). Constitutive vs. causal embodiment 12 Embedded cognition Imagine the desk that you usually study at. What does it look like? How does it support the activities that you perform at it? 13 Embedded cognition We rely heavily on our environment to make cognitive tasks tractable! “intelligent agents do best when they travel informationally light” (Robbins & Aydede 2009, p. 11) 14 Embedded cognition A bit of an aside (but a nice illustration of how *little* information we utilise from our environment): Change blindness https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkrrVozZR2c15 Extended cognition Our environment can actually be part of our mind – cognition does not stop at the skull, and cognitive processes can take place outside the brain. The distinction between mind vs. environment is not a principled one. 16 Extended cognition image credit: https://medium.com/@wordsandsuch/prototyping-the-extended-mind-b522a145335e","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
