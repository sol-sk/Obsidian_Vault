They took 23 horses, 6 wagons and 26 camels. The expedition took a large amount of equipment, including enough food to last two years, a cedar-topped oak camp table with two chairs, rockets, ﬂags and a Chinese gong; the equipment all together weighed as much as 20 tonnes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burke_and_Wills_expedition The Burke and Wills expedition 28 June 1861 21 April 1861 20 August 1860 9 February 1861 ~3250km The expedition reached Swan Hill on 6 September and arrived in Balranald on 15 September. There, to lighten the load, they left behind their sugar, lime juice and some of their guns and ammunition. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burke_and_Wills_expedition The Burke and Wills expedition 28 June 1861 21 April 1861 20 August 1860 9 February 1861 ~3250km At Bilbarka on the Darling, Burke and his second-in-command, Landells, argued after Burke decided to dump the 60 gallons (≈270 litres) of rum that Landells had brought to feed to the camels in the belief that it prevented scurvy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burke_and_Wills_expedition The Burke and Wills expedition 28 June 1861 21 April 1861 20 August 1860 9 February 1861 ~3250km The Burke and Wills expedition nardoo damper / bush bread incorrectly prepared: high in thiaminase -> vitamin B1 deﬁciency, also known as beriberi Cultural evolution • individual learning: learning without reliance on other individuals (e.g. trial and error, scientiﬁc discovery) • social learning: learning that involves some form of reliance on others who already possess a given piece of knowledge (e.g. imitation, explicit instruction) knowledge acquired in lifespan of individual individual learning social learning both Cultural evolution • individual learning: learning without reliance on other individuals (e.g. trial and error, scientiﬁc discovery) • social learning: learning that involves some form of reliance on others who already possess a given piece of knowledge (e.g. imitation, explicit instruction) knowledge acquired in lifespan of individual individual learning social learning both social learning + individual learning allow for the accumulation of knowledge over time Cultural evolution • both individual learning and social learning are biologically costly • big & well-developed brains (instead of e.g. muscles) • time spent learning / doing R&D (instead of gathering food) • prosociality (instead of e.g. eating all the food) • how is social learning adaptive, then? Cultural evolutionenvironment / adaptation time (generations) biological adaptation suﬃcient Cultural evolutionenvironment / adaptation time (generations) biological adaptation too slow Cultural evolutionenvironment / adaptation time (generations) cultural adaptation to the rescue! Cultural evolutionenvironment / adaptation time (generations) no adaptation possible :( Cultural evolution • one suggestion: • brain size relative to body size correlates positively with social learning & individual learning across species • increases in brain size relative to body size in several mammalian lineages over last 14 million years • also: increases in environmental variability (= climate in this case) over same period • (but: correlation does not equal causation…) Cultural evolution • a (now discounted) theory of the adaptive advantage of social learning: • individual learning / discovery is potentially very costly (e.g. discovering what mushroom species are edible… ) • social learning less costly (as the price has already been paid by others) in a variable environment, the ﬁtness advantage conferred by social learning decreases as the number of individual learners falls Cultural evolution • a (now discounted) theory of the adaptive advantage of social learning: • individual learning / discovery is potentially very costly (e.g. discovering what mushroom species are edible… ) • social learning less costly (as the price has already been paid by others) social learning -> higher ﬁtness number of social learners increases Cultural evolution • a (now discounted) theory of the adaptive advantage of social learning: • individual learning / discovery is potentially very costly (e.g. discovering what mushroom species are edible… ) • social learning less costly (as the price has already been paid by others) social learning -> lower ﬁtness number of social learners decreases Cultural evolution • a (now discounted) theory of the adaptive advantage of social learning: • individual learning / discovery is potentially very costly (e.g. discovering what mushroom species are edible… ) • social learning less costly (as the price has already been paid by others) equilibrium: no population-level adaptive advantage compared to individual learning :( Cultural evolution • social learning can only increase the average ﬁtness of a population if it “allows the accumulation of behaviours that no individual learner could acquire in its lifetime” • i.e. social learning is only beneﬁcial if has a mutually reinforcing relationship with individual learning Cultural evolution • why is cultural evolution (mostly) unique to humans? • “true” imitation… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwwclyVYTkk Cultural evolution • why is cultural evolution (mostly) unique to humans? • “true” imitation… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwwclyVYTkk • scenario 1: modest degree of social learning individuals hang around others who have discovered e.g. a new means to extract food (e.g. cracking nuts); more likely to rediscover the same adaptive behaviour • scenario 2: true imitation individuals learn directly from other individuals, and can build atop their innovations (e.g. devise a more eﬃcient method for cracking nuts) Cultural evolution • why is cultural evolution (mostly) unique to humans? • Theory of Mind https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hLubgpY2_w Cultural evolution • why is cultural evolution (mostly) unique to humans? • Theory of Mind https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hLubgpY2_w • symbolic communication “The vacuum of space will kill you in a matter of minutes.” • … costly cognitive capacities! Cultural evolution • what kind of cognitive mechanisms can guide cultural evolution? • the “costly information hypothesis”: • when maximally accurate information is costly to acquire, evolution favours the extraction of (potentially less accurate) information from other members of the group through various heuristics / biases • content vs. context biases Cultural evolution WHAT WE LEARN e.g. innate linguistic abilities Cultural evolution HOW WE LEARN e.g. who should I learn from? Cultural evolution • prestige & success biases • variation in how successful individuals are in a group, some of it conditioned by culturally learnable behaviours • makes sense to learn from more successful individuals! • ability to rank individuals in terms of success also observed in other species • but not the ability to selectively learn from successful individuals Cultural evolution • prestige & success biases: challenges • teasing apart random variation (noise) vs. true success one hit wonders Justin Bieber • strategies: • learning from multiple individuals, probability of learning proportional to success • aggregate over diﬀerent instances of success: e.g. track wealth, health, etc. Cultural evolution • prestige & success biases: challenges • what makes Justin Bieber so successful? wonderful hair? ﬂawless fashion choices? intense gaze? tattoos? Cultural evolution • prestige & success biases: challenges • what makes Justin Bieber so successful? wonderful hair? ﬂawless fashion choices? intense gaze? tattoos? diﬃcult to ﬁnd traits that confer ﬁtness COPY ALL! Cultural evolution Can you think of examples where an individual is successful due to some speciﬁc trait, but other individuals copy multiple aspects of their behaviour? Cultural evolution • prestige & success biases: • success-based copying may lead to prestige hierarchies • access to successful individuals is limited • learners can maximise likelihood of access by paying deference to successful individuals • cultural evolution of overt displays of prestige hierarchies • newcomers can make use of such cues in trying to determine who to learn from Cultural evolution • conformity biases: • information about success may be diﬃcult to obtain • some strategies may only be marginally better than others • e.g. 60% chance of ﬁguring out that blowgun is slightly more eﬃcient than bow & arrow using individual learning Cultural evolution ? Cultural evolution ? Cultural evolution ? conforming to the majority in such a situation will lead to choosing the adaptively more advantageous pattern with a probability > 60% Cultural evolution • conformity biases: challenges • if all learning is based on conformity, there won’t be any innovation • best strategy: a mix of conformist learning, other forms of transmission (e.g. parent-oﬀspring) and individual learning Cultural evolution Can you think of examples where social learning biases backﬁre, leading to adaptively negative behaviours / societal issues?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
