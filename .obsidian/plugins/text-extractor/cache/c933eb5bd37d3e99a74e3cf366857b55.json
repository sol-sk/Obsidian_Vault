Figuring a maximum round trip travel time of three months, they carried twelve weeks of food and supplies. Eight weeks later they reached tidal swamps on the northern coast and began their return. After about ten weeks their supplies ran short and they began eat- ing their pack animals. After twelve weeks in the bush, Gray died of illness and exhaustion, and the group jetti- soned most of their remaining sup- plies. A month later, they arrived back in their base camp, but found that their support crew had recently de- parted, leaving only limited supplies. Still weak, the threesome packed the available supplies and headed to the nearest outpost of “civilization,” Mt. Hopeless, 240km south. In less than a month, their clothing and boots were beyond repair, their supplies were again gone, and they ate mostly camel meat. Faced with living off the land, they began foraging efforts and tried, un- successfully, to devise means to trap birds and rats. They were impressed by the bountiful bread and ﬁsh avail- able in aboriginal camps, in contrast to their own wretched condition. They attempted to glean as much as they could from the aboriginals about nar- doo, an aquatic fern bearing spores they had observed the aboriginals us- ing to make bread. Despite traveling along a creek and receiving frequent gifts of ﬁsh from the locals, they were unable to ﬁgure out how to catch them. Two months after departing from their base camp, the threesome had become entirely dependent on nardoo bread and occasional gifts of ﬁsh from the locals. Despite consum- ing what seemed to be sufﬁcient calo- ries, all three became increasingly fa- tigued and suffered from painful bowel movements. Burke and Wills soon died, poisoned and starved from eating improperly processed nardoo seeds. Unbeknown to these intrepid adventurers, nardoo seeds are toxic and highly indigestible if not properly processed. The local aboriginals, of course, possess specialized methods for detoxifying and processing these seeds. Fatigued and delusional, King wandered off into the desert where he was rescued by an aboriginal group, the Yantruwanta. He recovered and lived with the Yantruwanta for several months until a search party found him. The planning for this expedition could not have been more extensive, and these men were not unprepared British schoolboys out on holiday. However, despite their big brains, camels, specialized equipment, train- ing, and seven months of exposure to the desert environment prior to run- ning out of supplies, they failed to sur- vive in the Australian desert. This bit of history makes a simple point: Hu- mans, unlike other animals, are heavily reliant on social learning to acquire large and important portions of their behavioral repertoire.

Humans are unique in their range of environments and in the nature and diversity of their behavioral adaptations. While a variety of local genetic adaptations exist within our species, it seems certain that the same basic genetic endowment produces arctic foraging, tropical horticulture, and desert pastoralism, a constellation that represents a greater range of subsistence behavior than the rest of the Primate Order combined. The behavioral adaptations that explain the immense success of our species are cultural in the sense that they are transmitted among individuals by social learning and have accumulated over generations. Understanding how and when such culturally evolved adaptations arise requires understanding of both the evolution of the psycho- logical mechanisms that underlie human social learning and the evolutionary (popu- lation) dynamics of cultural systems. Evolutionary Anthropology 123 culture,” or generalized cost-beneﬁt calculators delivered to these men the knowledge of how to detoxify nardoo spores or how to make and use rat traps, bird snares, or ﬁshing nets from locally available materials. Unlike so- cial learning in other animals, human cultural abilities generate adaptive strategies and bodies of knowledge that accumulate over generations. Foraging, as it is known ethnographi- cally, would be impossible without technologies such as kayaks, blow- guns, bone tools, boomerangs, and bows. These technological examples embody skills and know-how that no single individual could ﬁgure out in his lifetime. Nonmaterial culture, such as seed processing techniques, tracking abilities, and medicinal plant knowledge, reveals similar locally adaptive accumulations. Interest- ingly, this adaptive information is of- ten embodied in socially learned rules, techniques, and heuristics that are applied with little or no under- standing of how or why they work. Thus, understanding a substantial amount of human adaptation requires understanding the cultural learning processes that assemble our behav- ioral repertoires over generations. This is not, however, a call to separate humans from the rest of nature. A productive approach should seat hu- mans within the broader context of mammalian and primate evolution while at the same time being able to explain how and why humans are so different in the diversity and nature of their behavioral adaptations. Our goal in this paper is to review recent devel- opments in understanding both the evolution of the psychological mecha- nisms that make cultural evolution possible and the population-level con- sequences of those individually adap- tive mechanisms. Most of the relevant work occurs within a pair of closely related approaches: gene-culture co- evolution1–5 and dual-inheritance the- ory.6,7 These approaches examine the interactions between genetic and cul- tural inheritance systems. In these models, individual phenotypes are combinations of both genetic and so- cially transmitted characters, which in turn affect the transmission rates of different alleles and cultural variants. Early models explored, among other things, how different modes of cul- tural inheritance affect rates and out- comes of cultural evolution2 and how natural selection acting on genes can produce a semi-autonomous inheri- tance system.7 Like human behavioral ecology,8 coevolutionary and dual-in- heritance theories are concerned with adaptation. Unlike human behavioral ecology, however, these theories model the proximate mechanisms that produce adaptations. Like evolu- tionary psychology, these theories share an interest in the design of cog- nition. Unlike most evolutionary psy- chology, however, dual-inheritance and gene-culture models are rigor- ously formalized, take account of so- cial learning, and explore population processes. For many questions, strictly outcome-oriented or culture- free models are sufﬁcient and insight- ful. For many others, however, taking account of cultural dynamics is essen- tial. As the Burke and Wills story illus- trates, even hunter-gatherer adapta- tion is substantially reliant upon evolved cultural knowledge and tech- nology. To understand adaptation in human societies with any time depth seems very difﬁcult without some at- tempt to account for the evolutionary dynamics that produce such adapta- tions. Throughout this paper we will use “cultural learning” and “cultural transmission/acquisition” to refer to the subset of social learning capacities that allow for cumulative cultural evo- lution. We use “culture” to refer to the information acquired by individuals via social learning. Processing nardoo and making arrow poison, for exam- ple, are cultural practices because in- dividuals learn them from other mem- bers of their social group. The mental representations that allow individuals to detoxify the fern spores or bring down large game with relatively light- weight bows and arrows do not come coded in their genes, nor are these continually relearned by each individ- ual via trial-and-error experimenta- tion or deduced solely by ﬁtness-ori- ented cost-beneﬁt analysis. Instead, such adaptations result from and em- body the cumulative effects of the ef- forts, experiments, errors, insight, and interactions of many individuals across generations. Conceptualizing culture as socially learned information stored in people’s brains opens up new sets of evolution- ary questions. We will review the re- search on ﬁve of these: How does so- cial learning in humans increase adaptability and thereby allow our species to successfully occupy such an enormous range of environments? If cultural learning mechanisms are so adaptive, why are such mechanisms seemingly rare in nature? What cog- nitive processes guide human social learning? If cultural variants do not replicate like genes, can culture evolve? How does the coevolution of genes and culture inﬂuence human psychology and the histories of hu- man societies? These ﬁve questions build a natural progression of puzzles, from the genetic origins of cultural inheritance to the dynamics of mod- ern cultural and societal evolution. WHY IS CULTURAL LEARNING ADAPTIVE? To understand the evolution of so- cial learning, theorists have developed formal models to study how temporally and spatially changing environmen- tal conditions affect the evolutionary trade-offs between capacities for in- dividual learning (for example, trial and error), social learning, and “hard- wired” behavioral responses.1,5,7,9 –15 Most of these models are very abstract and apply to a wide range of animal social learning, not just human cul- tural transmission. They show that so- cial learning is favored throughout a large intermediate range of environ- mental ﬂuctuation, especially when environments are highly autocorre- lated. The intuition behind these re- sults is that social learning allows or- ganisms to respond more quickly to environmental changes than do hard- wired responses, but only by exploit- ing a body of adaptive knowledge that is stored in the learned behavioral rep- ertoire of the population. At one ex- treme, when environments ﬂuctuate on the order of thousands of genera- tions, social learning serves no pur- pose since raw natural selection act- ing on genes can, on average, do just as well without paying for expensive social learning machinery. At the other extreme, when ﬂuctuations oc- 124 Evolutionary Anthropology ARTICLES cur on the order of single generations, there is little adaptive knowledge for social learners to exploit. However, with intermediate rates of change, on the order of tens or hundreds of gen- erations, social learning mechanisms both outpace genetic adaptation and have sufﬁcient time between environ- mental changes to accumulate a body of adaptive knowledge in the popula- tion. When viewed alongside a growing pool of empirical evidence, this theo- retical work suggests that both indi- vidual and social learning from an in- tertwined adaptive response to increasing amounts of environmental variability16,17—what Potts18 calls variability selection. First, there is new evidence that increases in brain size relative to body size are corre- lated with both social and individual learning abilities across species. In primates, brain size corrected for body size correlates most strongly with social learning abilities, but also with individual learning (“innova- tion”) and tool use, all three of which are highly intercorrelated.19 As far as we know, no similar studies exist for mammals in general, although there are similar ﬁndings for birds.20,21 Sec- ond, these data suggest that increases in brain size in the paleontological record have been partly driven by in- creases in social learning abilities. Right up to the present, the record shows that several mammalian lin- eages have undergone increases in brain size relative to body size. Fi- nally, over the same period, ice-core data show increasing degrees of cli- matic variation: Over the last fourteen million years, which is the limit of the time depth of the data, increases in climatic variability are mirrored by increases in brain ratio. This combi- nation of evidence, alongside the for- mal theory that independently impli- cates environmental variation with increases in social learning abilities, suggests that human cultural capaci- ties may be a hypertrophied subset of a larger class of learning abilities that have evolved in many species.22 Yet humans stand out in the num- ber and diversity of environments they inhabit. What is the role of social learning in human adaptability, and how have these abilities permitted a tropical primate to spread so rapidly and successfully into so many habi- tats—from the dry savannahs and tropical forests of equatorial Africa to the Arctic tundra and humid swamps of New Guinea—while most other mammals with plausibly well-devel- oped social learning abilities show comparably restricted ranges? Prior to a clever paper by Rogers,23 several researchers had argued that social learning improves human adaptabil- ity by exempting individuals from the costs of individual learning.5,7,24 The argument seems cogent enough: Time costs and potential mistakes can make individual learning quite expensive. If another individual or group of indi- viduals has already paid those costs, learning from that behavior may be considerably cheaper. Imagine the task of selecting among mushroom varieties through individual learning. Because some mushrooms are poi- sonous, the price of choosing the wrong mushroom is quite high. How- ever, an individual who learns from others which mushrooms are poison- ous spares herself those potential costs, provided that the behavior of others is adaptive. However, Rogers showed that this argument is insufﬁcient to explain the adaptive success of our cultural spe- cies. Using a very simple model, he proved that sparing individuals the costs of individual learning will not, on its own, lead to increased overall adaptability in the population—the mean ﬁtness of the population is not increased. While social learners do very well when they are rare, they do poorly when they are common. With- out any individual learners, social learners cannot track changes in the environment, and the ﬁrst individual learner entering a group of social learners always has higher ﬁtness than the others. This means that at equilibrium the mean ﬁtness of the population as a whole is the same as that in a population of purely individ- ual learners. Social learning alone does not increase adaptability. Box 1 explains this mathematical argument in more detail. Boyd and Richerson11 extended Rogers’ result to more com- plicated models in which social learn- ers can identify and preferentially copy individual learners, the environ- ment varies spatially as well as tempo- rally, imitation generates errors, and there are more than two behaviors. None of these changes alter the result that the evolution of social learning does not lead to a more ﬁt population. Cultural capacities, as represented in these models, do not raise the overall ﬁtness of the population, so they are unlikely to explain the adaptive success of our species in the last 200,000 years. In the same paper, however, Boyd and Richerson11 showed that social learning can lead to higher mean ﬁt- ness provided either that it allows the accumulation of behaviors that no in- dividual learner could acquire in its lifetime or improves the efﬁciency of individual learning. When either is the case, social learning may increase the mean ﬁtness of the population. The ﬁrst condition is in fact the question we started the paper with, and we will discuss it at length in the next section. The second condition is satisﬁed if learners use individual learning when it is cheap and reliable, and switch to social learning when individual learn- Without any individual learners, social learners cannot track changes in the environment, and the ﬁrst individual learner entering a group of social learners always has higher ﬁtness than the others. This means that at equilibrium the mean ﬁtness of the population as a whole is the same as that in a population of purely individual learners. Social learning alone does not increase adaptability. ARTICLES Evolutionary Anthropology 125 ing is expensive.7,14 We think both are at work in human cognition. However, the adaptive gains possible through the second mechanism alone seem modest in comparison to those produced by cu- mulative cultural evolution. WHY ARE CAPACITIES FOR CUMULATIVE CULTURAL TRANSMISSION RARE? Several of our colleagues are fond of the “Why not baboons?” stratagem: If an evolutionary scenario is meant to explain some unique (or at least nearly unique) feature of humans, then it must also be able to explain why baboons—and many other ani- mals— do not fall under the same evo- lutionary logic. We have seen many clever theories crumble before this in- terrogation. The story we outlined earlier is vulnerable to the same criti- cism. Although human cultural capac- ities can be seen as part of a more general pattern of adaptation for learning in variable environments, their immense adaptiveness and ap- parent uniqueness poses an evolution- ary puzzle: Why haven’t the social learning capacities that generate cu- mulative cultural adaptations repeat- edly evolved along with other individ- ual and social learning abilities in many mammalian lineages over the last fourteen million years? Thus, here we attempt to explain why human-like cultural capacities should be rare in nature, as we believe they are, despite being extremely adaptive. While an increasing amount of ﬁeld evidence suggests that other animals, particularly chimpanzees, may main- tain traditions that result from social learning,25–28 there is little reason to believe that nonhuman social learning capacities can generate cumulative adaptation.7,29,30 In contrast, accumu- lated cultural skills and knowledge are characteristics of all human societies. While the psychological mechanisms that make cumulative culture possible are unclear, there are some promising ideas. Tomasello, Kruger, and Rat- ner29 suggested that true imitation, or observational learning—the direct and accurate copying of behaviors, strategies or symbolic knowledge—is necessary for cumulative cultural evo- lution. Other kinds of social learning may lead to traditions, but not to the accumulation of adaptive informa- tion. Imagine that individuals are ca- pable of a modest amount of individ- ual learning, so that interaction with the environment slowly generates adaptive behavior. If naive individuals tend to hand around other individu- als, and some of these individuals pre- fer to hang around certain kinds of food sources, because they have indi- vidually learned how to exploit those food sources (for example, cracking nuts or termiting), then naive individ- uals would be more likely to devise a means to exploit that resource. This would be social learning, but since in- dividuals have to reinvent the details of the behavior for themselves, albeit accelerated by proximity to conspecif- ics, the behavior cannot become more complex across generations beyond a certain point. Naive individuals do not get a “head start,” and thus cannot begin where previous learners left off. If, instead, individuals acquire their behavior by directly observing and Box 1. Mathematical Argument As we explain in the text, Rogers’23 model demonstrates that social learning alone will not increase the average ﬁtness of a population of cul- tural organisms. A simple graph can make the argument much clearer. Figure (a) plots the ﬁtnesses of in- dividual learners (wl, dark line) and social learners (ws, thin line), as well as the population mean ﬁtness (w\u0001 , dotted line), for all frequencies of so- cial learning in the population ( p). When social learners are rare, they do signiﬁcantly better than individual learners, since most potential models are practicing the correct behavior. As social learning becomes more common, however, the population lags behind the environment more and more until individual learning pays just as well as social learning, at p˜ . Natural selection will stabilize the population at this equilibrium, at which both social and individual learners receive ﬁtness w˜ , which is the same as the average population ﬁtness when p \u0001 0, when there are no social learners. But if we allow the frequency of social learning to reduce the costs of individual learning, a new equilibrium arises at which the population mean ﬁtness is greater than that of a popu- lation of individual learners. Figure (b) shows the modiﬁed model in which the costs of individual learning de- crease as the frequency of social learning increases. Now the popula- tion mean ﬁtness w˜ is greater than the mean ﬁtness in a population of indi- vidual learners, w0. In order for social learning to increase adaptability, the mean ﬁtness of the population, it must also somehow increase the ﬁt- ness of individual learning. In the text, we discuss plausible mechanisms for this effect. 126 Evolutionary Anthropology ARTICLES copying the details of others’ tech- niques, then individual learning can build atop previous innovations.31 A version of this distinction that allows for more continuity with chimpanzees would be that chimps possess modest true imitative capacities, but the com- plexity of the skills and technologies they can represent and the ﬁdelity of their transmission is less than that of humans. True imitation is probably not the whole story, however, at least not in the long run. In modern humans, a suite of social learning abilities con- tributes to the maintenance and accu- mulation of culture. Simpler forms of observational learning (of physical skills, for example) likely provided a foundation for more complex kinds of social learning and inference, such as those associated with symbolic com- munication and language. Symbolic communication through proverbs, stories, and myths allows for a great deal of cultural transmission without “observation” in the usual sense.31,32 For example, !Kung hunters knew a great deal of natural history, includ- ing the fact that porcupines are mo- nogamous.33 It is hard to imagine that knowledge of this kind is preserved through observational learning alone. However, Tomasello30 argues that true imitation, rooted in a genetically evolved capacity for Theory of Mind, generates both linguistic and nonlin- guistic forms of cultural evolution, and that linguistic symbols (including grammatical structures) have gradu- ally accumulated, improved, and adapted through a cultural evolution- ary process analogous to that ob- served in the domain of material cul- ture and technology. Whatever the speciﬁc nature of the mechanisms— be they true imitation or not—it remains puzzling why they should be so rare. Boyd and Richer- son34 constructed a model of the evo- lution of cumulative cultural capaci- ties designed to explore this puzzle. In their model, a population lives in a variable environment in which there is a unique optimal adaptive value of a quantitative trait. Each generation, there is some probability that the en- vironment changes so that a new value of the trait is optimal. Individual phenotypes are a combination of ge- netic inﬂuences and cultural trans- mission. Other genes affect an indi- vidual’s reliance on imitation, but carry an incremental ﬁtness cost. All individuals engage in some individual learning, which moves their pheno- types a small amount toward the cur- rent optimum. But individuals with a substantial reliance on cultural learn- ing can acquire phenotypes much closer to the optimum, once such phe- notypes exist in the population. These phenotypes are then improved a small amount by individual learning. This process repeats every generation. Unlike the simpler social learning models discussed in the previous sec- tion, this work demonstrates that a substantial reliance on cultural learn- ing is unlikely to spread initially, but goes to ﬁxation and is stable once a critical threshold frequency is sur- mounted (Box 2). Natural selection fa- vors cultural learning only when the costs of developing and maintaining cultural learning mechanisms are smaller than the beneﬁts gained by acquiring simple behaviors that could be learned on one’s own. But, despite being difﬁcult to get started, once a reliance on cultural learning is com- mon in the population, it is easy to sustain. Provided that the environ- ment is not too variable, the rate of accumulation of adaptive behavior through cultural learning can easily pay for the cost of the psychological capacities needed to make it possible: Cultural learning mechanisms pro- vide access to the knowledge accumu- lated over generations that simple so- cial learning does not. However, because cultural capacities are not fa- vored when rare, we should not expect them to be widespread in nature. A population must traverse a ﬁtness val- ley before the frequency of true imita- tion is high enough to make it individ- ually advantageous. Because other forms of social learning are often built principally out of individual learning, and do not involve inferential recon- structions of behaviors and strategies, they do not face this dilemma— but they also cannot generate cumulative cultural adaptation. Having offered an explanation of why cumulative cultural abilities might be rare in nature, we are left with the question of why it was spe- ciﬁcally the human ancestral lineage that crossed the cultural threshold. One possibility is that ancestral hu- mans just happened to drift geneti- cally across the threshold. Random events of this kind were likely impor- tant in the evolutionary histories of many species. However, we think it is more productive to ask if there was something particular about the hu- man lineage that made it more likely than other species to cross this cul- tural threshold. Perhaps our evolving cultural capacities depended ﬁrst upon some other adaptation, which might have arisen for another reason entirely.34 Good answers here are probably a long way off, but specula- tion based on the existing information will help direct future research. WHAT COGNITIVE MECHANISMS GUIDE CULTURAL EVOLUTION? Like evolutionary psychology, dual- inheritance theory combines evolu- tionary theory with empirically While an increasing amount of ﬁeld evidence suggests that other animals, particularly chimpanzees, may maintain traditions that result from social learning, there is little reason to believe that nonhuman social learning capacities can generate cumulative adaptation. In contrast, accumulated cultural skills and knowledge are characteristics of all human societies. ARTICLES Evolutionary Anthropology 127 grounded assumptions about the en- vironments inhabited by ancestral hu- man populations to make predic- tionsa about the details of human psychology— details that often specify cognitive mechanisms people use to extract adaptive ideas, beliefs, and practices from their social environ- ments. However, the approach di- verges from mainstream evolutionary psychology in emphasizing the costly information hypothesis. This hypoth- esis focuses on the evolutionary trade- offs between acquiring accurate be- havioral information at high cost and obtaining less accurate information at low cost. When accurate information is unavailable or too costly, individu- als may exploit the information stored in the behavior and experience of other members of their social group. By exploring how the costly infor- mation hypothesis generates trade- offs in the evolution of our cognitive capacities, we can generate produc- tive theories about the details of hu- man cultural psychology. When infor- mation is costly, natural selection will favor cognitive mechanisms that al- low individuals to extract adaptive in- formation, strategies, practices, heu- ristics, and beliefs from other members of their social group at a lower cost than through alternative individual mechanisms. Human cog- nition probably contains numerous heuristics and learning biases that fa- cilitate the acquisition of useful knowledge, practices, beliefs, and be- Box 2. Cultural Learning Regions for which cultural learning has an advantage over individual learn- ing, for the Boyd and Richerson34 model. The curves show the internal unstable equilibrium of cultural learners versus individual learners and repre- sent the threshold frequency at which cultural learning becomes favored by selection. This is shown for two values of \u0001, the probability that the environ- ment changes each generation and renders a new behavior adaptive. In each case, culture learners will in- crease in the region above the curve and decrease below it. When individual learning is difﬁcult (left side of plot), cultural learning cannot invade the population be- cause too few individuals have the skilled behavior. When cultural learn- ing is rare, the only behaviors that exist in the population are those that are solely the result of individual learning (those that could be ﬁgured out by one individual in his lifetime). The cost (for example, in adding met- abolically costly brain tissue) does not easily outweigh the beneﬁt be- cause there is little adaptive informa- tion contained in the behavior of oth- ers that the animal cannot ﬁgure out on its own. It is important to keep in mind that the developmental or ﬁt- ness costs of true imitation mecha- nisms may be quite high, even though, from our human perspective, imitation itself strikes us as being quite easy. It is “easy” because our cognition is “designed for” imitation and social learning (for example, in- fants show both sophisticated imita- tive and inferential abilities, as well as a strong desire to imitate70). As we move toward slightly easier problems, cultural learning still can- not invade, but is stable once com- mon. Once cultural capacities are common, population processes will begin to assemble complex adapta- tions, and individuals who have the ability to acquire them will do sub- stantially better than those who can- not. Under these conditions, cultural learning does for genes what they cannot do directly for themselves. Looking at the far right side of the plot, where individual learning is easy, essentially everyone acquires highly adaptive behavior without paying the additional costs of cultural learning capacities, so cultural learning is rarely adaptive. In all cases, there are many more combinations of parameters for which cultural learning is stable when common, but cannot invade the pop- ulation when rare. In the case where \u0001\u0002 0.4, implying that the optimal be- havior changes in 40% of genera- tions, there is no difﬁculty of individ- ual learning for which cultural learning invades, but a wide range for which cultural learning is stable. 128 Evolutionary Anthropology ARTICLES havior (“cultural traits” or “represen- tations”). These mechanisms can be usefully modeled at the algorithmic level, much as some cognitive scien- tists investigate other kinds of infor- mation processing. Such cultural learning mecha- nisms, all of which build atop other social and cultural learning abilities, can be categorized into content bi- ases and context biases. Box 3 orga- nizes the various forms of cultural learning mechanisms. Content bi- ases, or what Boyd and Richerson7 called direct biases, exploit informa- tive cues of an idea, belief, or behav- ior itself, and thereby inﬂuence the likelihood of imitation. An equiva- lent perspective prefers to discuss cultural learning as adaptive infer- ences triggered by content biases for cues provided in the behavior of oth- ers.35 Many such biases may have evolved because they facilitate the acquisition of ﬁtness-enhancing cul- tural traits.2,4,7 Because content bi- ases are likely numerous and gener- ally conﬁned to particular domains of culture, for space considerations we have omitted any substantial dis- cussion of them here. However, in thinking about content biases, it is important to keep in mind a number of things. First, jury-rigged evolu- tionary products, like human minds, are likely to contain accidental by- products and latent structures that create biases for ﬁtness-neutral be- haviors, ideas, beliefs, and val- ues.36,37 Boyer38 detailed one kind of by-product content bias in his expla- nation for the universality of reli- gious concepts (like ghosts). Second, even content biases that arose be- cause they led to the adoption of ﬁt- ness-enhancing behavior in ancient environments may now promote the adoption of quite maladaptive prac- tices. Third, content biases may be either reliably developing products of our species-shared genetic heri- tage or they may be culture speciﬁc. People may learn valuable content cues via cultural learning or, having acquired one idea or practice via cul- tural transmission, may be more likely to acquire another because the two “ﬁt together” in some cognitive sense. Context biases, on the other hand, exploit features of potential models or the frequencies of alternative behav- iors or strategies, rather than features of the alternatives themselves, to guide social learning. There is a great deal of adaptive information embod- ied in both who holds ideas and how common the ideas are. A large amount of modeling effort has been expended in exploring the conditions under which different context biases evolve and how strong natural selec- tion would prefer they be. These mod- els derive from ﬁrst principles about how individual cognitive biases affect both individual ﬁtness (when they evolve) as well as the patterns of in- formation in the population (what they evolve). Our remaining discus- sion of psychological mechanisms fo- cuses on two categories of context bi- ases in cultural learning: success and prestige bias and conformity bias. Success and Prestige Bias If individuals vary in skills (for ex- ample, tool making), strategies (track- ing techniques), or preferences (for example, for foods) in ways that affect Box 3. Cultural Learning Mechanisms Content biases and heuristics arise from the interaction of human psy- chology and the characteristics or “cues” associated with the thing be- ing transmitted (the idea, representa- tion, or behavior). These biases affect the likelihood of a particular mental representation being transmitted be- cause of the content of the represen- tation. Content effects can take many forms. They may reﬂect the direct ac- tion of natural selection on our “pre- pared learning” abilities, such as lan- guage, folk biology, and color categories. They may also arise as by-products of cognitive evolution: Boyer’s38 approach to cultural phe- nomena like ghosts and gods is one example. Or they may emerge from a kind of more generalized cost- beneﬁt calculation: People prefer steel axes to stone axes because it is much less work to cut down trees with steel. Such biases may result for either genetically transmitted cognitive structures (as in Boyer’s argument) or culturally acquired mental representations. Context heuristics arise from the learning environment or context. Model- based biases result from cues or characteristics of the potential model (“an individual who may be imitated”) and make the ideas, men- tal representations, or behavior of their possessor more likely to trans- mit than those held by other individ- uals. Other model-based biases may include age, sex, ethnicity, and healthful appearance. Frequency bi- ases use the commonality or rarity of a behavior as a cue. ARTICLES Evolutionary Anthropology 129 ﬁtness, and at least some components of those differences can be acquired via cultural learning, then natural se- lection may favor cognitive capacities that cause individuals to learn prefer- entially from more successful individ- uals. The greater the variation in ac- quirable skills among individuals, and the more difﬁcult those skills are to acquire via individual learning, the greater the pressure to preferentially focus one’s attention on and imitate the most skilled individuals. If indi- viduals evaluate potential “cultural models” (individuals they may learn from) along dimensions associated with competence in underlying skills (such as hunting returns), and focus their social learning attention on those who are more successful, they will be more likely to acquire adaptive strategies.31 Interestingly, while the ability to rank individuals by foraging success is observed in nonhumans (for better scrounging),39 there is no evidence that individuals in these spe- cies acquire strategies from successful foragers. With the rise of cultural ca- pacities in the human lineage, natural selection needed only to connect these learning abilities with preexisting ranking capacities. A bias of this kind is a standard assumption in evolutionary game the- ory,40 where a preference for copying the strategies of successful individuals generates an evolutionary dynamic that is usually mathematically indis- tinguishable from natural selection acting on genes. However, uncertainty about the payoffs and success of other individuals complicates success-bi- ased learning. Schlag41,42 has ex- plored the exact form that such an adaptive bias should take in the pres- ence of noisy feedback about the suc- cess of other individuals, ﬁnding that a linear weighting of models by their observed payoffs may be more adap- tive than simply imitating the individ- ual with the highest observed payoff. Another solution is for individuals to use aggregate indirect measures of success, such as wealth, health, or family size, which integrate over many instances and smooth out per- ceptual and stochastic errors. This may explain the widespread observa- tion that people copy successful indi- viduals, as deﬁned by local standards. (See Henrich and Gil-White31 for a summary of the laboratory and ﬁeld evidence.) However, an additional problem created by using indirect indicators of successful strategies is that it is often very unclear which of an individual’s many traits have led to success. Are people successful because of how they tend their farms, cook their food, or make sacriﬁces to the spirits, or all three? Because of this ambiguity, hu- mans may have evolved the propen- sity to copy successful individuals across a wide range of cultural traits, only some of which may actually re- late to the individuals’ success.7,31,43 If information is costly, it turns out that this strategy will be favored by natural selection even though it may allow neutral and maladaptive traits to hitchhike along with adaptive cultural traits. In a world of costly informa- tion, cognitive adaptations do not al- ways produce adaptive behavior from the point of view of genes, even in ancestral environments. Nevertheless, the theory does allow for predictions about the conditions under which maladaptive cultural traits will spread. The evolution of a success bias may also be able to explain the formation of prestige hierarchies. Once success- biased transmission has spread through a population, highly skilled individuals will be at a premium, and social learners will need to compete for access to the most skilled individ- uals. This creates a new selection pressure on success-biased learners to pay deference to those they assess as highly skilled (those judged most likely to possess adaptive informa- tion) in exchange for preferred access and assistance in learning. Deference beneﬁts may take many forms, includ- ing coalitional support, gifts, general assistance (house-building), and car- ing for offspring.31 With the spread of deference for high skilled individuals, natural selec- tion can take advantage of these ob- servable patterns of deference to fur- ther save on information-gathering costs. Naive entrants (say immigrants or children), who lack detailed infor- mation about the relative skill of po- tential cultural models, may take ad- vantage of the existing pattern of deference by using the amounts and kinds of deference different models receive as cues of underlying skill. As- sessing differences in deference pro- vides a best guess of the skill ranking until more information can be accu- mulated. This also means that skilled individuals will prefer deference dis- plays that are easily recognized by others (in public). Thus, along with the ethological patterns dictated by the requirements for high ﬁdelity so- cial learning (proximity and atten- tion), deference displays also include diminutive body positions and socio- linguistic cues. The end point of this process gives us the psychology, soci- ology, and ethology of “prestige,” which must be distinguished from those associated with phylogeneti- cally older “dominance” processes.31 From this theory, Henrich and Gil- White31 derived twelve predictions about the interrelationships between preferential imitation or inﬂuence, deference, and other ethological pat- terns, individual characteristics (like age and sex), and memory. A review of data from psychology, economics, and ethnography turned up a sizable amount of evidence consistent with these predictions. Conformist Bias It is unlikely that success and pres- tige biases solve all costly information problems, however. What do you do when any observable differences in success and prestige among individu- als do not covary with the observable differences in behavior? For example, suppose everyone in your village uses blowguns for hunting except one reg- ular guy who uses a bow and arrow and obtains fairly average hunting re- turns. Do you adopt the bow or the blowgun? One solution for dealing with such information-poor dilemmas is to copy the behaviors, beliefs, and strategies of the majority.7,14 Termed confor- mity bias, this mechanism allows in- dividuals to aggregate information over the behavior of many individuals. Because these behaviors implicitly contain the effects of each individual’s experience and learning efforts, con- formist transmission can be the best route to adaptation in information- poor environments. To see this, sup- 130 Evolutionary Anthropology ARTICLES pose every individual is given a noisy signal (a piece of information) from the environment about what the best practice is in the current circum- stances. This information, for any one individual, might give them a 60% chance of noticing that blowguns bring back slightly larger returns than bows. Thus, using individual learning alone, individuals will adopt the more efﬁcient hunting practice with proba- bility 0.6. But, if an individual sam- ples the behavior of 10 other individ- uals, and simply adopts the majority behavior, his chances of adopting the superior blowgun technology increase to 75%. Obviously, if everyone uses only conformist transmission, no adapta- tion or cultural evolution occurs, but models of interaction among different learning mechanisms indicate that natural selection will very often favor a mix of social and individual learning with a substantial reliance on confor- mity. Extending Boyd and Richer- son’s7 original model, Henrich and Boyd14 used simulation to investigate the interaction and coevolution of ver- tical transmission (parent-offspring transmission), individual learning, and conformist transmission in spa- tially and temporally varying environ- ments. These results conﬁrm that con- formist transmission is likely to evolve under a very wide range of conditions. In fact, these results show that the range of conditions that favor con- formist transmission are wider than those for vertical transmission alone, suggesting that if advanced social learning via vertical transmission evolves at all, we should also expect to observe a substantial conformist bias. The model of the combination of conformity bias with individual learn- ing and vertical transmission leads to three predictions: 1. Individuals will prefer conformist transmission over vertical transmission, assuming it is possible to access a range of cultural models at low cost, which is often, but not always the case; 2. As the accuracy of information acquired through indi- vidual learning decreases, reliance on conformist transmission over individ- ual learning will increase; 3. Individu- als should be sensitive to substantial shifts in the relevant environments so that they decrease their reliance on conformist transmission after recent ﬂuctuations or increase it after immi- grating. Work combining these models with empirical investigations is growing. Kameda and Nakanishi44 have further extended the Henrich and Boyd14 model to predict how human psychol- ogy should respond to changes in the cost of individual learning and de- signed experiments to test their pre- dictions. By analyzing the temporal dynamics of historical cases of the dif- fusion of innovations, Henrich45 has found evidence that is consistent with a strong role for both conformity- and success-biased transmission and in- consistent with a strong role for indi- vidual learning. We imagine future work will illuminate the complex in- teractions among conformist and other social learning biases in envi- ronments in which the costs and qual- ities of information vary. IF CULTURAL VARIANTS DO NOT REPLICATE LIKE GENES, CAN CULTURE EVOLVE? So far, we have treated the inheri- tance of cultural variants as unprob- lematic. However, because much of the initial work in coevolutionary the- ory involved tools from population ge- netics and theoretical evolutionary bi- ology, there are good reasons to examine the strength of the analogy between genes and “memes.” Dawkins, in The Extended Pheno- type,46 described what he saw to be the necessary characteristics of any replicating entity: longevity, fecun- dity, and ﬁdelity. The structure of this argument has been used to support the analogy between genetic and cul- tural (or “memetic”) evolution: Cul- tural ideas can be replicators as well, and hence culture may evolve as do populations of alleles. Some cognitive and evolutionary anthropologists, however, have severely criticized the power of this analogy, arguing that cultural ideas are rarely if ever repli- cated during social learning and that culture is substantially transformed by human psychology so that ideas are rarely transmitted intact so there are no or few discrete units in cul- ture.35,38,47,48 For these reasons, they argue, cultural variants (“memes” or “representations”) have little ﬁdelity and so cannot evolve in a Darwinian sense. Essentially, if cultural inheri- tance involves continuously blending (nondiscrete) traits and mutation-like processes are powerful, memes will not fulﬁll Dawkins’ requirements for a replicator. Without a replicator, the argument goes, there can be no cul- tural evolution. These arguments should be taken seriously. If culture is not an evolving system in the Darwinian sense, then many coevolutionary theories (and, of course, substantial portions of this pa- per) require serious rethinking. Build- ing on the preceding points, Sper- ber,35 Boyer,48 and Atran47 have argued that many existing models of cultural evolution are inappropriate, transmission cannot explain the per- sistence of behavioral variation in hu- mans, and cultural evolution cannot produce adaptations. If these argu- ments are correct, the story we told earlier about culture accumulating powerful locally adapted skills and technologies is somehow mistaken. We think the arguments we re- viewed earlier are valid in this respect, however. There are good reasons to suppose that culture is an evolution- ary system, even if the three claims Obviously, if everyone uses only conformist transmission, no adaptation or cultural evolution occurs, but models of interaction among different learning mechanisms indicate that natural selection will very often favor a mix of social and individual learning with a substantial reliance on conformity. ARTICLES Evolutionary Anthropology 131 above are true. In two recent articles, Henrich and coauthors49,50 use three mathematical models and several other lines of argument to show that the objections mentioned here do not follow from their assumptions. Through these analyses, the authors demonstrate how Dawkins’ original claims about replicators and Darwin- ian evolution were wrong—replica- tors are sufﬁcient for cumulative evo- lution, but not necessary. In their ﬁrst model, Henrich and Boyd49 address two complaints: that culturally transmitted ideas are rarely if ever discrete and that inferential biases in learning (Sperber’s “strong attrac- tors”) swamp the effects of selective transmission and prevent Darwinian adaptation. This model assumes that individuals’ possess mental representa- tions (“cultural variants,” beliefs, and scripts) that are inﬂuenced by selec- tively learning from some individuals (for example, from successful individu- als). These mental representations are continuous (nondiscrete or quantita- tive), so each individual may possess a somewhat different variant of the rep- resentation. There are no “copies” of variants, only social “inﬂuence.” Fur- thermore, in learning these representa- tions, individuals use inferential pro- cesses that strongly bias the ﬁnal form of the representation. Their analysis shows that these complaints are deduc- tively invalid. If cognitive inferential in- ﬂuences are sufﬁciently strong relative to selective forces (selective learning), a continuous (quantitative) model re- duces to a discrete-trait replicator model commonly used in population models of both culture and genes. In fact, the stronger the effects of inferen- tial bias on learning, the better is the discrete trait approximation. Moreover, this means that it is the weak effects of selective transmission that determine the ﬁnal equilibrium of the system. In the second and third models, the authors construct systems that allow for large amounts of transmission error to show that accurate individual-level replication of cultural variants is not necessary for selective forces to gener- ate either cultural inertia or cumulative cultural adaptation. The second model shows how conformist transmission can act to drastically reduce the effect of transmission errors and still generate either cultural inertia or diffusion of successful variants. The third model combines all the potential problems with models of cultural evolution— continuous (nondiscrete) mental representations, incomplete trans- mission, and substantial inferential transformations—and shows not only that adaptive cultural evolution may still occur under empirically plausible conditions, but that it also predicts when such adaptive evolu- tion will not occur. Many of the insights from these for- mal models have been known for some time but, unlike Dawkins’ repli- cator argument, have not successfully spread. While Sperber, Boyer and At- ran’s criticisms apply to the informal theorizing of some memeticists,46,51,52 they are wide of the mark for much formal gene-culture coevolutionary theory. Continuous trait models go back to the very beginning of the ﬁeld. Boyd and Richerson7 argued in 1985 that there is no need to assume par- ticulate “units” in order to build evo- lutionary models, in fact showing that blending models best produce herita- ble variation exactly when transmis- sion is inaccurate. In fact, nineteen of the thirty-eight models presented in their book are continuous (nondis- crete) trait models that allow for an arbitrary amount of transmission er- ror. Similarly, Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman2 devoted one of their ﬁve chapters entirely to continuous trait models. These continuous models al- low for substantial error and other forms of nonreplication. Similar to cognitivist critics, Boyd and Richer- son also explicitly distinguish public representations from mental repre- sentations (though using different ter- minology) throughout their book, and repeatedly specify the inferential transformation between observed be- havior and representation formed. They also make explicit reference to much research in psychology on the nature of social learning and propose the following pathway for the trans- mission of cultural variants: Modeled events 3 Attention Processes 3 Re- tention Processes 3 Motor Reproduc- tion 3 Motivation Processes 3 Matching. Chapters 4 and 5 in Boyd and Richerson’s book discuss how cognitive structures—what Sperber35 would later call “attractors”— bias cultural change so that some out- comes are more likely than others, and even use some of the same exam- ples as Boyer.48 The force of arguments like those of Sperber, Atran and Boyer seems to be that cultural learning requires innate, domain-speciﬁc psychological mecha- nisms (we agree!), and therefore that most of the action is in individual psy- chologies and not in the population dy- namics. This conclusion is unfounded: An understanding of cultural evolution requires studying both the evolved cog- nitive abilities and inferential mecha- nisms that allow for cultural learning, as well as the population processes to which they give rise through social in- teraction. Culture can have heritable properties and evolve in a Darwinian sense even if it is continuous, error- prone, and individually ephemeral. HOW DOES COEVOLUTION INFLUENCE PSYCHOLOGY AND SOCIETY? A persistent debate in the social sci- ences is whether the chief causal level An understanding of cultural evolution requires studying both the evolved cognitive abilities and inferential mechanisms that allow for cultural learning, as well as the population processes to which they give rise through social interaction. Culture can have heritable properties and evolve in a Darwinian sense even if it is continuous, error- prone, and individually ephemeral. 132 Evolutionary Anthropology ARTICLES in social phenomena is the individual or the social. Instead of arguing that primary causation exists at either level, gene-culture population models take seriously and treat explicitly forces at both levels, and sometimes more. From this perspective, classic features of human cultures and soci- eties, such as culture being shared by members of self-ascribed groups, be- come results to derive, rather than a priori assumptions. These dialectical models have helped us to understand how interactions between cognition and population processes give rise to ethnically marked groups53,54 and eth- nic psychology,55 large-scale coopera- tion, prosocial psychologies, and group- beneﬁcial cultural norms.7,16,56 – 60 Rather than attempting to summarize this large literature, we focus only on one of the most recent models. The Coevolution of Ethnically Marked Groups and Ethnic Psychology In almost all ethnographically known regions and historical periods, humans have organized themselves into self-ascribed groups marked by arbitrary symbols.61 For example, in both historical and modern East Af- rica, different pastoralist groups wear differently colored clothing, which serves as ethnic markers. In one re- gion of modern Tanzania, Maasai wear red, Sukuma wear blue, and Taturu wear black. Since no other pri- mate forms such symbolically marked groups, and existing rates of mixing among such groups would quickly erode differences of this kind if they were transmitted from parent to off- spring in any fashion (culturally or ge- netically), some explanation of their formation and maintenance is needed. Prior efforts to explain ethnicity have proved theoretically unsound. First, the standard approach to ethnic actors as strategic manipulators re- quires that some other processes gen- erate and maintain ethnic groups and their markings. If ethnicity were solely the product of strategic consid- eration or a coalitional psychology,62 ethnicity would rapidly disappear as a phenomenon and there would not be anything to manipulate.54,63 A more serious idea is that ethnic markers al- low actors to select individuals with whom to cooperate.64,65 These efforts fail because, unless some process pre- vents out-group members from adopt- ing the same markers, individuals who wear the markers but do not co- operate will destroy the signal value of the symbols.66,67 So the question re- mains: How do such markers arise and what are their functions? In addressing this puzzle, McEl- reath, Boyd, and Richerson54 con- structed a model of the emergence of ethnic marking in which markers function to provide coordination (not cooperation, so there is no free-rider problem) with other individuals who share one’s norms. Coordination means that individuals are better off when they practice complementary behaviors. The familiar example of this occurs in cross-cultural commu- nication,68 where different expecta- tions in many aspects of interaction routinely lead to lower payoffs for all parties. The coaching book market for international business people attests to the severity of these problems. It is likely that the same phenomenon oc- curs in many other aspects of cultur- ally inherited behavior. Having the same norms about child rearing, bar- ter, marriage, inheritance, and con- ﬂict resolution can be crucial for suc- cessful social relations. Since the number of domains of this kind is likely large and many such rules are held unconsciously, the mutual costs of interactions between individuals with different sets of norms can be substantial. The model is sketched as follows. First, imitation of the successful and social interaction produces culturally differentiated communities. In each social group, whatever norm is ini- tially most common leads to the high- est payoffs, making it more common. Then, provided individuals are biased to interact with people who share the same arbitrary symbolic markers as themselves, symbolically marked groups that possess different cultural norms arise endogenously in the model. Furthermore, even if there is initially no genetically transmitted psychological bias to interact with other individuals who share your same marker, natural selection, oper- ating in this culturally constructed en- vironment, will favor genes that reli- ably produce this bias since individuals who prefer to interact with those with the same marker are more likely to interact with someone with the same norms as themselves, and therefore proﬁt more from social interaction. The model also makes some unex- pected predictions about the nature of ethnic marking. While the model re- quires spatial variation in norms to evolve the association between norms and markers, once markers are asso- ciated with underlying norms, and provided other processes permit a tight linkage between them, spatial variation in norms is no longer needed to maintain functional ethnic markers. Instead, the “ethnic” groups in the model merge, forming one large multiethnic community in which indi- viduals still coordinate their interac- tions based on markers delineating distinct ethnic divisions. Since mark- ers in such a situation allow individu- als to assort nearly perfectly with oth- ers who share their norms, members of smaller norm communities are not at a disadvantage relative to the nor- mative majority. Situations like this resemble in an abstract way modern multiethnic cities like Los Angeles or Detroit,69 in which many ethnic groups live intermixed but preferen- tially interact among themselves. The model makes predictions about both evolved psychological propensi- ties and sociological patterns, and ex- plicitly links them. Ethnic marking arises as a side effect of other psycho- logical mechanisms—which them- selves have solid individual-level se- lective advantages—that happen to generate behaviorally distinct groups. The strategy of using arbitrary sym- bolic markers to choose interactants then evolves because of features of the culturally evolved environment. Cul- tural transmission mechanisms may create statistically reliable regularities in the selective environments faced by genes.4,57 Thus, explaining many im- portant aspects of human psychology and behavior will require examining how genes under the inﬂuence of nat- ural selection responded to the regu- larities produced by culture. This means that understanding the behav- ior of a highly cultural species like ARTICLES Evolutionary Anthropology 133 humans will sometimes demand a cul- ture-gene coevolutionary approach. Phenotypic optimality models and models that ignore the population dy- namics of social learning certainly have their place, and have proven very useful. But satisfying answers to many important questions concerning human behavior, from the cultural microevolution of foraging adapta- tions to the coevolution of human psy- chology and cultural variation, will re- main elusive unless dual inheritance or some similar approach is taken se- riously.
