𝑁#;<. = 58 100 = .58 Example: Dice 4 What is the probability of an odd roll with 1 dice? – a priori probability = .50 – a posteriori probability = .58 • Goal of statistical inference: – What should we predict for future observations? • Odd = .50 • Odd ≠ .50 > .50? < .50? Are the dice rigged, or did we observe randomness? Example: Does advertising work? 5 What is the probability of choosing Pepsi? – a priori probability 𝑝 = #\t#$\t%!\"##$%&' &!\"##$%&'\t')'*+# = '\t()*++,-\t ) /\t()*++,-. +1 ) = .50 – a posteriori probability • Data: 100 participants, 58 choose pepsi 𝑝 = #\t𝑜𝑓\t +2,. 𝑁+2,. = 58 100 = .58 Inferential Statistics Did we observe randomness or something real? – Did the ad work or did we accidentally sample from more pepsi people? – In Psychology, we will always observe ‘random’ processes: We quantify how much is random and how much is real. 6 Descriptive Statistics Probability Theory Inference!! Was it random or real? 7 Definitions • Mutually exclusive events cannot happen at the same time – Dice cannot land on even and odd • p(A & B) = 0 • Statisticians suck: When representing 2 mutually exclusive outcomes, use P and Q 8 P = 1 - Q Definitions • Independent events have no influence on each other – 1st roll of dice does not influence 2nd roll • Correlation between dice rolls, ρ = .000 • Exhaustive sets of events describe all possible events – We know whether a dice roll is “A” or is “not A” • e.g., “even” or “not even” 910 Addition Rule • Use addition when one of several possible outcomes will occur • What is the probability of rolling an odd number or a multiple of 3? – Not mutually exclusive, both outcomes can occur at the same time! 11 p(A or B) = p(A) + p(B) – p(A and B) p(odd or multiple of 3) = p(odd) + p(multiple of 3) – p(both) Addition Rule • Use addition when one of several possible outcomes will occur • What is the probability of rolling odd number or a 6? – These are mutually exclusive events! p(A and B) = 0 12 p(A or B) = p(A) + p(B) – p(A and B) p(odd or 6) = p(odd) + p(6) Mutually exclusive Test yourself • In a seminar class containing 10 students, 7 are female, 6 are Psychology majors, and 5 are both female AND psychology majors. What is the probability that a randomly- selected student is either female OR a psychology major? 13 Multiplication Rule • Quantifies probability of successive events • What is the probability of rolling ‘snake eyes’ in craps? – What is the probability of rolling 1 and then another 1? – Important: These are independent events! 14 p(A and B) = p(A)\t× p(B|A) p(1 and 1) = p(1) × p(1|1*) When events are independent, p(1 and 1) = p(1) × p(1) Combining Rules • What is the probability of rolling ‘yo-leven’? – Definition: Sum of two dice = 11 15 Two ways to reach yo-leven: 1. p(5)\t× p(6|5) = ! \" × ! \" = ! #\" + 2. p(6) × p(5|6) = ! \" × ! \" = ! #\" = Way #1 + Way #2, or , -. + , -. = 𝟐 𝟑𝟔 or .056 Dependent Successive Events • What is the probability of being dealt “Cowboys” in poker? – Two cards that are both kings 16 N = 52 cards 4 kings p(king) = : 49 p(cowboys) = : 49 × ( 42 = 29 9649 = .0045 Dependent Successive Events • What is the probability of being dealt “pocket pairs” in poker? – Two cards that match in number 17 N = 52 cards 13 different numbers 4 cards for each number p(pairs) = 29 9649 + 29 9649 … 29 9649 (13 times) p(pairs) = 29\t×\t2( 9649 = 246 9649 = .0588 Test yourself • What is the probability of being dealt two hearts in poker? – Now, what about same suit of any suit? 18 N = 52 cards 4 different suits (hearts, spades, clubs, diamonds) 13 cards in each suit p(2 hearts) = 2( 49 × 29 42 p(2 hearts) = 2(\t×\t29 9649 = 246 9649 = .0588","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
