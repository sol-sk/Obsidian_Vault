Brain Abnormalities –Treatments–Animal models–Bipolar disorder/mania•NOTE: No lectures on anxiety disorders-you will not be tested on this•Major unipolardepression is one of the most common mood disorder, characterized by:–Unhappy mood (more an absence of happiness than increased sadness), worthlessness, guilt, desperation–Loss of interest, motivation (anergia), and appetite, blunted ability to experience pleasure (anhedonia)-or at least pursue it–Difficulty in concentration, restless agitationDepression: What is it?•An episode of depression may occur with no apparent cause (endogenous) or can be triggered by external events (reactive)−High co-morbidity of depression w/ many other medical conditions•Major costs to individual and society–Dramatically increased risk of suicide (7-15% vs ~1% general population)–Impact on relatives/friends of the individual with depression–Lost productivity costs23DSM Diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder≥5 symptoms during the same two week period that are a change from previous functioning; depressed mood and/or loss of interest/pleasure must be present−Symptom clusters vary with individuals; there are depression subtypes associated with distinct causes and pathophysiologies.−Over 200 combination of different symptoms can be diagnosed as “depression”4•Unipolar depression typically alternates with normal emotional states, with an episode lasting up to 6-9 months.―Episodes can recur through life, often increasing in frequency and intensity•Prevalence: In North America, > 10% of population may be afflicted at any one time –Considerable sex difference: women more likely to be diagnosed–In women, incidence often coincides with major hormonal changes (post partum, menopause)Epidemiological Factors in Depression –Incidence of depression has increased over the last 50 years, and age of onset has decreased (currently ~ 27 years old)–Genetic influences: Some types of depression may have a genetic influence, whereas others less soStress and Depression (I)•Depression is viewed as a stress-related disorder─Can emerge during stressful life periods•At least some forms of depression may be linked to alterations in HPA-axis and higher cortisol (CORT) levels•People with Cushing’s syndrome have high levels of glucocorticoids and are prone to depression.•Circulating CORT levels tend to be higher in depressed subjects vs other disorders or controls.A popular theory of depression is the diathesis-stress model (ie: an individual has some sort of predisposition for depression, and stress can trigger the syndrome)5•The dexamethasone suppression testcan show excessive CORT release•Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, can suppress CORT release in normal people, but not in depressed patients.6Stress and Depression (II)•Dexamethasone can “fool” the HPA axis into believing there are higher levels of CORT than normal –through negative feedback, levels drop in healthy controls•In many depressed patients, negative feedback mechanisms are disrupted.7The Monoamine Hypothesis of Depression•Three major monoamine neurotransmitters are 5-HT, noradrenalineand dopamine•1950-60s:Reserpine(drug that reduces monoamine levels) induces depression•First monoamine oxidase inhibitors (which block metabolism of monoamines and increase brain levels) alleviated depression•First tricyclic antidepressant (Imipramine, which blocks monoamine reuptake) also found effective •1980s: Fluoxetine (aka-Prozac™) a -selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) found to be effective at treating depression•All of these findings support the monoaminehypothesis:Depression is the result of abnormal reductions in brain monoamine (mostly 5-HT and noradrenaline) levelsMonoamine TransporterPostsynaptic neuronPresynaptic terminalRESERPINE(depletes vesicles)Monoamine Oxidase(chews up monoamines)XXTricyclics(blocks reuptake)•1) Antidepressants increase monoamine levels quickly, yet there is a lag in the reduction of symptoms (chronic treatment is required)•2) Not all depressed patients respond to drugs that increase monoamine levelsThere is a large placebo effect –antidepressants tend to improve symptoms vs placebo in the most severely depressed patientsSSRIs are not more effective than classic tricyclics that effect noradrenaline release as well (but have fewer side effects)•3) SSRIs associated with increased risk of suicide in children and adolescents (but causal relationship unclear).•4) In animal models, depletion of 5-HT does not cause a depressive-phenotype–Suggest that there is more to the disorder than merely a overall decrease in 5-HT levels in the brainTreatment Issues and Limitations of the Monoamine Hypothesis89Functional imaging studies have revealed:•Increased blood flow to amygdala and ventral parts of medial prefrontal cortex•Some aspects of depression may be caused by disrupted regulation of amygdala emotional processing by certain parts of PFC•Alterations in brain activation can be normalized with antidepressant treatment•Reduced hippocampal volumes also observedBrain Changes With DepressionHigher activity in ventromedial PFC•Dysfunction of prefrontal cortex may be one of the underlying mechanisms that leads to aberrant negative appraisals of life events (everything seems a lot worse than it is, persistent rumination on negative events)•Electroconvulsive shock therapy(ECT): one of the original treatments for depression─Method of action poorly understood, still used today in extreme cases.•Transcranial magnetic stimulation(TMS)also alters cortical electrical activity.•Deep Brain Stimulation(DBS) –electrode is surgically implanted in brain, very high frequency stimulation given continuously.10Other Treatments for Depression─Thought to inactivate targeted brain region –DBS in ventromedial PFC or other subcortical areas has been shown to be effective at alleviating depression in treatment resistant patients─No controlled experiments have been done11•Ketamine (non-competitive NMDA antagonist): Sub-anesthetic doses induce rapid reduction in symptoms for ~70% of treatment-resistant patients (after psychosis dissipates). —Effects last 1-3 weeks—Nasal formulation recently approved for use•Method of action not fully understood, but may be linked to increased cortical activityOther Treatments for Depression•Cognitive/Behavioural Therapy –takes a longer time, but just as effectiveas antidepressant drugs –when used in combination with other treatments, even more effective.12Animal Models of Depression•Models: certain experimental manipulations may cause some sort of “depressed” conditionin laboratory animalsLearned helplessnessanimal is exposed to a repetitive, inescapable stressful stimulus. After repeated exposure, some more sensitive animals will not escape when given opportunity. —Those that do not escape tend to have cellular/neurochemical alterations in the brain, (eg: decrease in 5-HT function).—Acute antidepressant treatment can reduce behavioral despair13Bipolar Disorder (Mania/Depression)•Lithiumis a mood-stabilizing drug used to treat bipolar disorder that has widespread actions in the brain.•Modulates 5-HT AND dopamine transmission•Interacts with the circadian clock•Lithium may enhances Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) activity that may reduce cell death associated with bipolar disorder.•Bipolar disorder is characterized by periods of depression alternating with expansive mood, or mania.•The rate of cycling varies; rapid cycling consists of four or more cycles in one year.•Some may cycle several times in one day.•Neural basis not fully understood but appears to involve abnormalities in the hippocampus, amygdala","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
