Types of neurotransmitters 2 Learning objectives 1. Name and describe the two basic types of receptors. Why have both? 2. Describe receptors by their locations. Describe the relationship between receptor location and its function. 3. Name three types of neurotransmitter clean-up. 4. Name the major groups of neurotransmitters, and some examples within each group. 5. Describe the two primary types of drug action. 6. Describe the roles of glutamate, GABA, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, endocannabinoids, adenosine, and the endogenous opioids. 7. Describe some drugs that affect these systems, including their drug action. 8. Is dopamine the pleasure molecule? Is serotonin the mood molecule? Is norepinephrine the memory molecule? Support your answers with evidence. 3 Next question: How does one neuron transmit its message to another? Introduction 4 End of the line • Axon ends in terminal boutons (“buttons”) • Bouton has vesicles (“bubbles”?) filled with neurotransmitters • Action potential depolarizes bouton à Vesicles fuse with membrane à Neurotransmitters released into synapse Introduction 5 Welcome to the synapse • Dendrite membrane has special receptors that fit, like lock and key, with the neurotransmitters • Receptors are often just (closed) channels that open when they bind with neurotransmitter! • i.e. ligand-gated ion channels Glu: glutamate, most common excitatory neurotransmitter Introduction 6 Receptor types Receptors • Ionotropic (channels) • Metabotropic (signalling proteins) 7 Receptor types • Ionotropic • AKA ligand-gated ion channels • Excitatory (depolarize) • Inhibitory (hyperpolarize) • Fast, transient effect Receptors8 Receptor types • Metabotropic • AKA G-protein- coupled receptors • Modulate cell • Modulate signals • Slow, longer lasting effect • Cause signal cascades Receptors9 Receptor locations • Postsynaptic • Presynaptic • Autoreceptors • Heteroreceptors Receptors10 Neurotransmitter clean-up • Diffusion • Enzymatic degradation • Re-uptake • Pre-synaptic • Astrocytes End of neurotransmission 11 Drug types • Agonist • Antagonist • Other • e.g. transporter blocker, reuptake inhibitor, enzyme inhibitor Receptors1213 Onto our specific neurotransmitter systems! Types of neurotransmitters 14 Glutamate • Primary excitatory neurotransmitter • Used throughout the brain • Ionotropic • AMPAR • NMDAR • Kainate • Metabotropic • mGluR • Often not a great target for drugs—why? Types of neurotransmitters 15 Drugs: Glutamate (all antagonists) • Barbiturates • Nitrous oxide • Ketamine • Ethanol • Pattern? • Agonists? Types of neurotransmitters16 GABA • aka gamma-Aminobutyric acid • Primary inhibitory neurotransmitter • Used throughout brain • Ionotropic and metabotropic • Again, often not a great target for drugs Types of neurotransmitters 17 Drugs: GABA (all agonists) • Benzodiazepines • Ethanol • Chloroform • Ether • Pattern? • Antagonists? Types of neurotransmitters 18 The amines • Dopamine • Epinephrine (Adrenaline) • Norepinephrine (Noradrenaline) • Histamine • Serotonin • All metabotropic—play a modulatory role Types of neurotransmitters 19 Motivation for… Brain Stimulation? • Olds and Milner (1954) • Dopamine: pleasure? • Dopamine projects from Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) to Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc) Types of neurotransmitters 20 Drugs: dopamine • All addictive drugs directly or indirectly increase dopamine transmission • Implication? • Amphetamine*, cocaine*, heroin, nicotine, oxycodone, ethanol, and on and on and on Types of neurotransmitters 21 Dopamine and Parkinson’s Disease • Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) • One of two major dopamine-producing regions • L-DOPA as PD treatment Types of neurotransmitters 22 Drugs: dopamine (antagonists) • Schizophrenia medications • Do individuals with schizophrenia have higher baseline pleasure? Types of neurotransmitters 23 Separating Pleasure from Motivation • Salamone (1990s) • Low effort, low reward vs. high effort, high reward • Dopamine antagonists • Decrease motivation but not pleasure • Can be systemic or directly injected into VTA or NAcc Types of neurotransmitters 24 Dopamine and reward prediction error • Schultz et al. (1990s) • Pavlovian learning • VTA (DA) neurons • Fire at first for unexpected reward • Shift their firing to stimuli that predict reward • Go silent when predicted reward not delivered (RPE) • Can be chained forward in time Dopamine25 Norepinephrine (aka noradrenaline) • Originates in brain stem region called the locus coeruleus • Causes heterosynaptic facilitation (via heteroceptors) • Enhancement of memory by stress/emotion • Evolutionarily useful Types of neurotransmitters 26 Propranolol (norepinephrine receptor antagonist) • Propranolol (norepinephrine receptor antagonist, aka noradrenergic receptor antagonist) • Potential PTSD treatment via reconsolidation • Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? Not quite, but not entirely unalike Types of neurotransmitters 27 Serotonin • Primarily from the raphe nuclei (brain stem) • Precursor: tryptophan • Serotonin depletion Types of neurotransmitters 28 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors • aka SSRIs, e.g. Prozac (fluoxetine) • For depression • Block serotonin from being removed from the synapse • Effects of SSRIs quick, improvements slow Types of neurotransmitters 29 SSRI efficacy • Meta-analyses: SSRIs no better than placebo for mild to moderate depression • May help with major depression (BUT…) Types of neurotransmitters 30 Hallucinogens Psychedelic drums like LSD, DMT, psilocybin etc. are serotonin receptor agonists! Radical changes to our conscious perception and thoughts, minimal effects on mood (implication?) Recent reexamination of psychedelics’ therapeutic value: end of life care, PTSD, addiction, and more Types of neurotransmitters 31 Acetylcholine • The neuromuscular junction • Also basal forebrain • Wakefulness, attention, etc. • Nicotine Types of neurotransmitters 32 Endocannabinoids • Two NTs, two receptors (GPCRs) • Travel from dendrite to axon, i.e. retrograde transmission • Weaken connection between two cells at a synapse • Cannabis is a cannabinoid receptor agonist Types of neurotransmitters 33 Adenosine • Remember: ATP is cellular energy • Adenosine is ATP byproduct • Adenosine receptors • Caffeine/theophylline Types of neurotransmitters 34 Endogenous opioids • aka Endorphins • Giant peptide neurotransmitters • The neurotransmitter system that exogenous opioids (e.g. heroin) mimic • Fentanyl and naloxone • Receptors are all GPCRs • Receptors found in spinal cord, periacqueductal grey (PAG), nucleus accumbens, more Types of neurotransmitters 35","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
