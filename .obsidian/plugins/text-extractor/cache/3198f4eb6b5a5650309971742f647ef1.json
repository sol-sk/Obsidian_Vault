A or B? A, because fewer links in causal chain Which explanation is more falsifiable? A or B? Violence in video games Aggressive behaviour by children Violence in video games Children are desensitised to violence Aggressive behaviour by children 5 Uri Geller 5 https://youtu.be/ycE863jRA9Q 6 Parsimony and Falsifiability ▪ Fewer conceptual relationships (assumptions) = less data required to counter a theory ▪ Fewer adjustments to established relationships in science = less data required to test adjustments ▪ We are evaluating the whole theory Parsimony Falsifiability Note to 004: Audio cuts here in recording. Watch the 003 recording instead. 7 An example study… ▪Video game violence and aggression Theory • Human behaviour is a function of exposure to environmental stimuli Hypothesis • Playing violent video games leads people to become more aggressive Conceptual variable 1 • Playing violent video games Conceptual variable 2 • Aggression 8 Essentialism and operationism 9 Essentialism ▪ There is an unchanging, underlying essence of an entity that can be defined ▪ Sense of fixedness ▪ Focus is on the meaning of words 10 Operationism ▪ Operational Definitions ▫ Observable indicator of each variable, used for the purposes of this particular study ▫ Enable reliable measurement or manipulation of each variable in your hypothesis ▫ How would you operationally define “aggression”? ▪ Might not be right or perfect, but a place to start 11 An example study… ▪ Video game violence and aggression Theory • Human behaviour is a function of exposure to environmental stimuli Hypothesis • Playing violent video games leads people to become more aggressive Conceptual variable 1 • Playing violent video games Conceptual variable 2 • Aggression 12 Video game violence & Aggression ▪ Target hypothesis: ▫ Playing violent video games leads people to become more aggressive ▪ Study’s hypothesis: ▫ Playing violent video games is associated with greater aggression 13 Video game violence & Aggression ▪ Operational definitions for this study: ▫ Playing (exposure to) violent video games ■ Frequency of playing favourite games x Rating of a game’s violence ▫ Aggression ■ Self-reported hostility ■ Scores on the Cook & Medley Hostility Scale ▪ Prediction: ▫ As one plays more violent games, the scores on the Cook & Medley Hostility Scale increase 14 Video game violence & Aggression ▪ Method: ▫ 607 8th and 9th grade students 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 10 20 30 40 50 60Trait Hostility Score (0 - 10) Exposure to Violent Video Games 15 Video game violence & Aggression ▪ Conclusion: ▫ These findings suggest that children may be affected by violent video games ▫ The results support our hypothesis that playing the violent game would result in more aggression than would playing the nonviolent game 1617 Follow-up study ▪ Change operational definition of aggression ▫ Self-report of hostility might not be accurate ▫ Use number of actual physical fights 0 1 2 3 0 10 20 30 40 50 60Physical Fight (1 = No, 2 = Yes) Exposure to Violent Video Games 18 So… ▪ Theory/Broad framework ▫ Playing violent video games leads one to exhibit greater aggression ▪ Do we have evidence of this? ▪ Do these data convince you of this? ▪ Do you see any more problems with these data?
