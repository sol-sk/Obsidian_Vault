NOT THAT SIMPLE! 6 No SRY= OVARY (from cortex) Yes SRY= Testes (from medulla) Y chromosome has SRY gene Encodes for SRY protein Shows up @ week 7 of development SRY protein causes TESTES formation NO SRY = OVARY formation Sexual Development (Gonadal) primordial undifferentiated 1 outerpart 2or has potential 2developinto whatever this iswhengenesare mostimportant 7 Female (XX) Sexual Development NO Y chromosome = NO TESTOSTERONE NO testosterone means: -Wolffian ducts shrink away -Mullerian ducts grow Forms fallopian tubes, uterus, part of vagina Starts around week 7 8 weeks 15 weeks -Forms as phenotypic female defaultprogram formontheir own noothersignaling needed 8 Male (XY) Sexual Development (1) Y chromosome means: *SRY GENE = SRY PROTEIN* Testes form and start to make: 1) Testosterone 2) Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) -AMH causes Mullerian duct to shrink -T causes Wolffian ducts to grow Occurs around week 7 testis - in 8 9 Male Sexual Development (2) •T masculinizes other structures through development -prostate gland, scrotum, penis •These effects are aided by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) •Cells in these areas have enzyme 5α-reductase = converts testosterone into DHT •Forms phenotypic male 8 weeks 15 weeks meatflower 10 Critical points •Development into phenotypic male or female controlled by PRESENCE or ABSENCE of TESTOSTERONE •NOT controlled by estrogens •Genes play a role, but presences/absence of hormones (testosterone) plays an equal or greater role in what you look like when you’re born, depending on what’s in the blood stream during this Critical Period • Sex chromosome controls sex of the gonad • GONADAL hormones determines sex of rest of the body 0 happens onitsown Tiffk","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
