Lesion studies could be used to distinguish (non- serial) cognitive subsystems whose functional distinctness may not have been apparent to us otherwise. • Two visual systems: ventral and dorsal streams (what/where, cognition/action) • Memory: long-term vs. short-term (incl. working memory), episodic vs. semantic, declarative vs. procedural, etc. Recall our question: “what is cognitive science?” Marr’s multi-level explanatory framework hints at a potential answer: the interdisciplinary endeavour of uncovering, via top-down functional analysis, the fine-grained computational structure of the (human) mind. The participating fields (psychology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience) are unified by a shared conceptual framework that allows a synoptic, multi-level account of the mind.

The language in which thinking and reasoning occurs is not a public language like English or Japanese but an internal language: a language of thought (‘Mentalese’). Indeed, public languages like English and Japanese presuppose LOT. LOT is specifically computational. 9/28/2023 Sample Footer Text 10 T H E H I S T O R Y O F T H E R E P R E S E N T A T I O N A L T H E O R Y O F M I N D ( ‘ R T M ’ ) • The idea that the mind is a representational system is not new. British empiricists of the 18th century (e.g., John Locke) hoped to explain knowledge and reasoning by positing imagistic ‘ideas’ (copies of sense experiences). • Acts of thinking and reasoning were taken to be causal sequences of associated such ideas. 9/28/2023 Sample Footer Text 11 T H E N E W - F A N G L E D R E P R E S E N T A T I O N A L T H E O R Y O F M I N D The version of RTM that Fodor defends (and that he claims to find in cognitive science) is distinguished by the claim that the mind is a digital computer, i.e., a formal symbol manipulator. Hence, he claims, the computational theory of mind (‘CTM’) is simply a new-fangled version of the old RTM. L A N G U A G E O F T H O U G H T H Y P O T H E S I S All thoughts possess two constituents: • A propositional content • The thought expressed (e.g., that it is Thursday, that it is overcast, that Vancouver is in Canada, etc.) • A propositional attitude • How the subject is thinking or cognitively related to the thought (e.g., believes, desires, hopes, fears, expects) 9/28/2023 Sample Footer Text 13 L A N G U A G E O F T H O U G H T H Y P O T H E S I S According to LOT: • The propositional content of a thought is the meaning of a LOT sentence. • The propositional attitude is the subject’s ‘computational relation’ to the LOT sentence, which we can think of as the causal or functional role that the sentence is playing in the subject’s mental economy. 9/28/2023 Sample Footer Text 14 L A N G U A G E O F T H O U G H T H Y P O T H E S I S The Language of Thought Hypothesis (LOT): S thinks that P if and only if S is cognitively related to a sentence (in S’s internal LOT) that means P. Amogh believes that grass is green if and only if Amogh stands in the belief-relation to a LOT sentence that means grass is green. 9/28/2023 Sample Footer Text 15 L A N G U A G E O F T H O U G H T H Y P O T H E S I S Jerry Fodor other LOT theorists will speak of LOT sentences being “in” the subject’s “belief box” or “desire box,” where the type of “box” a sentence is in a metaphor for how the sentence is disposed to causally interact with other LOT sentences and with behaviour. Fodor takes a cognitive process to consist in a causal succession of sentence-tokens. In the case of reasoning, these internal state-transitions obey strict syntactic rules. 9/28/2023 Sample Footer Text 16 I N T E G R A T I N G C O M M O N - S E N S E P S Y C H O L O G Y W I T H C O M P U T A T I O N A L P S Y C H O L O G Y Fodor holds that we can translate (near enough) the theoretical taxonomy of common-sense psychology into the theoretical taxonomy of computer science. Familiar mental states (propositional attitudes of belief, desire, etc.) and processes (mental acts of reasoning, planning, decision-making, etc.) are, at bottom, computational states (computational-functional relations to token sentences) and processes (causal sequences of sentences). We might see this as an attempt to theoretically ‘reduce’ personal level commonsense psychology to sub-personal computational psychology. 9/28/2023 Sample Footer Text 17 S O M E O F T H E M OT I VAT I O N S F O R L OT M O T I V A T I O N 1 : A V O I D I N G ‘ M E A N I N G H O L I S M ’ • Treats symbols as atomic units. Each word in Mentalese has a single semantic value that remains invariant across contexts. (There is no ambiguity in Mentalese). • The meaning of a complex Mentalese sentence is a systematic function of the semantic values of the constituent elements and how those elements are put together or syntactically arranged. (Mentalese has the properties that linguists call ‘constituency’ and ‘compositionality’). • The systematic recombinability of concepts allows uniformity of meaning. • Contrast: a functionalist account that attempts to explain thought exclusively in terms of causal-functional roles. 9/28/2023 Sample Footer Text 19 M O T I V A T I O N 2 : E X P L A I N I N G P R O D U C T I V I T Y A N D S Y S T E M A T I C I T Y The compositionality of Mentalese, in turn, seems to explain central features of human thinking: (i) Productivity: human thinkers have the capacity to understand a large (seemingly infinite) number of expressions without having ever encountered them before. (ii) Systematicity: if someone understands a complex expression (e.g., that Mary loves John), they will also understand different complex expressions that are obtained by recombining their constituents (e.g., that John loves Mary). (Cf. Evans’ ‘generality constraint’ on concept possession). 9/28/2023 Sample Footer Text 20 M O T I V A T I O N 3 : E X P L A I N I N G B O T H T H E C A U S A L A N D R A T I O N A L R O L E S O F T H O U G H T Fodor emphasizes that LOT is the only available theory of mind that lets us view our thoughts as both causing and justifying our behaviour. In virtue of their syntactic rules, the causal relations between LOT sentences mirror the rational (e.g., inferential) relations between the propositions that those sentences express. 9/28/2023 Sample Footer Text 21 M O T I V A T I O N 3 : E X P L A I N I N G B O T H T H E C A U S A L A N D R A T I O N A L R O L E S O F T H O U G H T Suppose someone is physically ‘wired’ in the following way. When any two sentences with the following syntactic properties are tokened in the subject’s belief box: P1: P → Q P2: P a third sentence of the following form is automatically tokened: C: Q Given this, we can predict what will happen next if the following two sentence-tokens were to occur in the subject’s belief box: P1: If the sun is out this morning, I’ll walk to class. P2: The sun is out this morning. They will, in conformity with the logical schema outlined above, token the consequent of the conditional in P1, namely: C: I’ll walk to class. 9/28/2023 Sample Footer Text 22 M O T I V A T I O N 3 : E X P L A I N I N G B O T H T H E C A U S A L A N D R A T I O N A L R O L E S O F THOUGHT Fodor’s idea: even though C is caused by purely syntactic properties of P1 and P2 (by their “shape” or “form”), the subject is nevertheless rationally justified in inferring C. This is because the transition from P1 and P2 to C obeys a valid inference rule. More generally, an individual’s thoughts will both cause and justify their actions when the syntactic relationships among their thoughts (i.e., the internal Mentalese sentences) are structurally isomorphic to the rational relationships among the propositional contents of their thoughts (i.e., the meanings of the Mentalese sentences). Exploiting such parallelisms between syntactic and semantic structure (in the manner of a Turing machine), LOT shows how everyday personal level reasoning can be fundamentally a mechanical process. 9/28/2023 Sample Footer Text 23 P E R I P H E R A L V S . C E N T R A L S Y S T E M S • Higher vs. lower cognitive processes • Controlled vs. automatic F O D O R – M O D U L A R I T Y O F M I N D ( 1 9 8 3 ) For Fodor, the key difference between central and peripheral processes is modularity. Some core features of modular systems: (i) informational encapsulation: a module’s internal operations are restricted to the incoming input, together with any internally information stored within the module (a ‘proprietary database’) (ii) speed (iii) domain-specificity – the inputs to a module are restricted to a particular subject matter (e.g., edges, faces) (iv) mandatory—once the inputs are received, the module’s algorithms operate automatically and involuntarily (see Fodor 1983, pp. 47–99). Apart from (i), Fodor was silent about whether these features are all essential, saying only that modules have “most or all” of them (p. 47).

And yet your knowledge of this fact does not seem to alter the way the lines visually appear. 9/28/2023 Sample Footer Text 26 C E N T R A L S Y S T E M S Likewise, what constitutes a processor as being non-modular is (first and foremost) informational un-encapsulation (a.k.a., cognitive penetrability), though Fodor seems that central processes are also slow, domain-general, and under intentional control. Notably, Fodor seems also to have assumed that the non-modular processes of central cognition to be sequential. (Here, he was likely influenced by the traditional concept of a computer CPU). C E N T R A L S Y S T E M S Fodor singles out ‘abduction’ (i.e., inference to the best explanation) as an example of a central, non-modular process. In abductive reasoning, we are essentially sensitive to ‘global’ properties of our total belief system – e.g., whenever we assess simplicity of an empirical hypothesis compared with other hypotheses, or how well it coheres or makes sense in light of everything else we take to be true. We are guided, throughout, by considerations of relevance. Cf. Davidson’s claims about the rational norms governing common-sense psychology.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
