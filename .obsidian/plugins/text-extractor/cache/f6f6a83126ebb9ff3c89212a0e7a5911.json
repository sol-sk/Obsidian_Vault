{"path":"W2023T1/W2023T1 Files/PSYC304-002 2023 Autumn - Syllabus.pdf","text":"University of British Columbia PSYC304-002: Brain and Behaviour (first semester of the course) Autumn 2023 Course overview: Your brain is staggeringly complex, and responsible for what you call your “self”—all your preferences, perceptions, memories, dreams, ambitions, desires, goals, emotions, and unique inferences are housed within the “pile of pudding” that accounts for a mere 2-3% of your body. And humans take great advantage of this organ, whether it’s creating works of art, lifelong friendships, space stations, or just appreciating the beauty of a sunset over the Pacific. This course is about linking the psychological background you have acquired—in essence, a study of behaviour—with the neurobiological underpinnings responsible for that behaviour. To understand our very selves, and the roots of our mind’s organization, we must start at the most fundamental unit of the nervous system: the neuron. Indeed, we will see how small changes in (for example) concentration of ions can radically alter our behaviour. From these basic building blocks of nervous system function, we will expand outward into a systems-level understanding of our basic sensory and motor systems, which will reveal evolution’s influence on our brain’s hierarchy and function. Instructor: Dr. Jay Hosking, Department of Psychology jayhosking@psych.ubc.ca Please bear in mind that my email volume is very high. When contacting me, please use your UBC email, and please note which course you are in, i.e. PSYC304-002.

Please let me know if you’re having any issues with the website! Lectures: On campus Tuesdays & Thursdays 9:30-10:50am, Swing 121 Office hours: Held virtually, booked via https://jayhosking.youcanbook.me TA office hours: Please email Daria or Cecilia for availability! Textbook: Breedlove and Watson’s Behavioural Neuroscience, Tenth Edition. Required (second semester; recommended first semester). PSYC304-002 Autumn 2023 syllabus 2 Grades breakdown: Syllabus quiz: 2% Exam 1 (midterm): 16% Exam 2 (midterm): 16% Exam 3 (“final” of first semester): 16% Total: 50% Bonus research participation: 3%* *You can only earn 3% bonus in total for research participation across the two semesters. By the end of the first half of this course you will be able to: • Explain and critically evaluate current topics and research in the field of neuroscience • Describe basic biopsychological processes at multiple levels of analysis • Use critical thinking skills through discussion and analysis of neuroscience issues • Define modern neuroscience and identify the major perspectives within it • Recognize, recall, connect, and evaluate neuroscientific concepts and theories from specific subfields (e.g., behavioural vs. cognitive) • Critically evaluate new evidence about brain and behaviour in your daily life • Understand, describe and differentiate between commonly used research methods in neuroscience, including experimental and correlational designs Land acknowledgement: UBC’s Vancouver campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded land of the Musqueam people. In 1908, UBC was built upon this land without consent from, or compensation to, the Musqueam people. I invite us all to re-examine and renew our commitments to truth and reconciliation. Note on lectures and attendance: Lectures will be held on campus and your attendance is expected, as per UBC’s “in person” designation of this course. The Department of Psychology has advised its faculty to not livestream any lectures, nor is there any requirement, expectation, or additional resources provided to record the lectures. For students who must be absent (e.g. due to illness), I will try to record lecture audio for each class, but these recordings will be sub-optimal and cannot be guaranteed. Attendance is a critical predictor of success in this course. (In fact, it’s a strong correlate of success for courses in general.) In this course, material that is taught in class will often be different from, or supplement, the readings. Moreover, lecture slides are designed to provide a framework for the lecture and any discussions. In other words, the important part of the lecture is not what is on the slides, but rather the lecture itself. If you try to rely solely on the slides for studying, you will not be successful, as much of the critical information is not explicitly written. It is therefore essential that you attend lecture. Please exercise respect and responsibility in attending our lectures, adhering to institutional policies. Please perform a daily health self-assessment before coming to campus. If you’re sick, please do not come to lecture. Please be kind, courteous, gracious, and patient with your PSYC304-002 Autumn 2023 syllabus 3 peers; some students may have health conditions, like a chronic cough, that can be misconstrued as symptoms of illness. In short, please give your fellow students the benefit of the doubt. Please understand that if I am sick or have symptoms of sickness, I will not be lecturing that day on campus. In sum, let’s take care of each other and be good to one another. Note: whom should you book office hours with? Please book office hours with one of your awesome TAs if: - You would like to review one of your exams. When reviewing your exam, you are not allowed to take notes on, or photos of, the exam. - You would like to discuss content from the course readings and/or study strategies. - You would like to discuss psychology or neuroscience more generally. Please book office hours with Dr. Hosking if: - You have an issue with course performance or progress. - You would like to discuss psychology and neuroscience more generally. Please note that questions about lecture content should be handled during lectures, on our discussion forum, or during the pre-exam review sessions, not during office hours. Note on booking office hours with Dr. Hosking: All office hours are held online, via Zoom. Please do not use email to book office hours with me. Instead, I have created a website for all office hours booking: https://jayhosking.youcanbook.me. The site will show all of my available office hours, as well as show a Zoom link for you to join. Please refrain from using office hours to ask course content-related questions—these are more valuable to all students if handled in class, on the class discussion forum, or during pre-exam review sessions (time permitting)—and leave office hours for personal/individual matters, like your own progress in the course. Finally, please do not book me for multiple timeslots in a given week; there are many students that need help, virtually all issues can be handled within the allotted time, and I will cancel any multiple bookings. Note on the course discussion forum We will be using Piazza for forum discussion this semester. Piazza is especially useful because it leverages your biggest asset in the class: your fellow students. You are amazing and exceptional individuals, and I encourage you to interact with your classmates to work on course content, get reminded on course administration, talk about interesting tangents, etc. Please note that I will be checking Piazza, but only as time permits, so think of Piazza as a student-centred discussion; it’s not an ideal place to get direct answers from me, versus talking to me after class or booking office hours. Note on email: Please bear in mind that we instructors get a lot of email and, if possible, would prefer to spend all our preparation time on making the lectures as useful, relevant, up-to-date, fun, and interesting to you as possible. Thus, please keep emails to administrative concerns (e.g. problems with the course website) if you can. For course-related content, please ask during in-class lectures, or during the pre-exam review session, or post it in the discussion forum on our course website. Finally, please use good email etiquette when contacting me— see lecture notes for more details. PSYC304-002 Autumn 2023 syllabus 4 Note on readings: We will be using the newest edition of the Behavioral Neuroscience textbook by Breedlove & Watson. Please note that this is a required textbook for semester two, with Dr. Floresco, but is only a recommended textbook for me. Here are my notes on the textbook for this semester: Material that is in the textbook but not lecture will not be tested in first semester. The purpose of the textbook is to act as a “second teacher”, a way to learn the concepts in class from a slightly different perspective, to clarify things that might not make sense from my lecture. In this sense, other textbooks may also be OK for the first semester, so feel free to ask me. (Just note you will be required to have the textbook for the second semester.) Reading the relevant chapters prior to the related lectures will likely make those lectures easier for you. Note on the possibility of course policy changes: Please bear in mind that this course’s policies are shaped by university mandates, which in themselves are shaped by provincial Public Health orders. If the current circumstances change, our policies may need to be adapted mid-semester. If this is the case, please know that I will try, wherever and however possible, to prioritize your safety and success in this course.

PSYC304-002 Autumn 2023 syllabus 5 Evaluation Note that this is for the first half of the course only, i.e. up to 50% of your grade for the entire course. 1. Exams (48%): There will be three exams, with two midterm exams written during the class time, and the “final” exam written during the exam period at a time designated by UBC administration (you must be able to write at any time during the final exam period). Midterm Exam 1 (16%) Tuesday October 10 th 9:30-10:45am Midterm Exam 2 (16%) Thursday November 9 th 9:30-10:45am “Final” Exam 3 (16%) December 11 th-22 nd (date & time TBD) Notes on the exams: • Exams are held on campus in our usual class, and you must be available to write the exam on campus at the appointed time. Exams can NOT be administered remotely. Please schedule ahead accordingly. (Accommodations with the Centre for Accessibility will of course be honoured.) • You must bring your student IDs to each exam. These will be used as proof of identification. If you do not have student ID, you must obtain it before the exams. • The exams are not cumulative, but the later material in the course clearly builds upon the earlier material. • Only materials from lecture will be tested. • Exams are “closed book”, with no referring to your notes. This may sound like it’s harder than an open-book exam, but it means that the nature of the questions I can ask you will be substantially easier. • You will not be able to write an exam if 1) you are more than 30 minutes late, or 2) another student has already submitted their exam and left the exam room— whichever occurs first. • If you are sick, do not come to the exam. Instead, contact me about accommodations. • Please empower yourself by reading about UBC’s academic concessions policies at http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0. • Specifically, if you must miss a midterm exam due to acute illness that will spontaneously resolve (e.g. the ’flu), you do not need to supply me (or any of your other instructors) with a medical note. Note that this policy does not apply to final exams (for final exams, see below). • If your unavoidable hardship is not an acute illness that will spontaneously resolve, then you may have to present me with evidence of such hardship, BUT please don’t send documentation or personal materials until I request them. • In any case, you must contact me within 48 hours of the exam if you need accommodation for that exam. If at all possible, please contact me about accommodations before the exam, not after. • Students who plan to be absent for work responsibilities, varsity athletics, family obligations, or other commitments, cannot assume they will be accommodated, and must discuss their commitments with me by September 15 th if they wish to be considered for accommodation. • Being accommodated for missing the midterm exam is at my sole discretion. PSYC304-002 Autumn 2023 syllabus 6 • If you miss a midterm exam, you must write a make-up exam with your TAs within one week of the original exam date. Please work with the TAs to determine a time for the make-up exam; you can start by sending them a screenshot of your course schedule. You will need to be flexible in the scheduling of the make-up exam: TAs are accommodating many students, only one alternative date may be offered for make-up exams, and students are expected to be accommodating to the TA’s availability. • If you miss a midterm exam, and you cannot write the exam at the appointed make-up exam time with the TAs because the unavoidable hardship persists, then an alternative concession will be made with myself and your faculty advising. • As the “final” exam is not truly a final exam, the same policy described above for make- up exams will hold for these third exams (i.e. one-week window to make up, and arrange with TAs). • All exams will include multiple-choice and short-answer questions. • Exam grades will be posted on Canvas. • You are strongly encouraged to review your exam with your TAs. When reviewing your exam, you are not allowed to take notes on, or photos of, the exam. • Grade adjustments are very uncommon but if a dispute between TAs and student occurs for grading, Jay will regrade that component of your exam—this can result in the same grade, an increase, or a decrease, depending on Jay’s judgement of your answer. Any grading disputes must be handled within 2 weeks of exam grades being released. 2. Syllabus quiz (2%): This quiz exists primarily to reduce student anxieties about how to approach complications that may arise during the semester, and provide clear information on whom to contact and how. The quiz will be posted on Canvas and must be completed by Tuesday, September 19 th at 11:59pm. Considering it’s simply a quiz of the policies listed in this syllabus document and the introductory slides, there will be no extensions for the quiz deadline. If you do not write the quiz, you do not receive the marks. 3. Research participation (up to 3% bonus across the two semesters): Text here provided by the Human Subject Pool team: As part of this course, you are invited to earn 3% extra credit. Most students will choose to earn these credits by spending three hours participating in psychology studies (worth 1% point for each hour) through the Department of Psychology’s Human Subject Pool (HSP) system. You can locate, create an account, and sign up for studies by going to https://hsp.psych.ubc.ca. Please register in the HSP system by the end of the first month of classes to have the opportunity to earn your first ½ hour credit with a brief online survey that will increase your eligibility for more studies. Once registered in the system, you will be able to browse through and select which studies you wish to participate in, sign up for an available timeslot, and confirm your accumulated credits afterward. At the end of the last day of class for the term, the subject pool is closed. At that point, you will no longer be able to receive credits. I strongly urge you to participate in and confirm your credits long before the last week of class since many studies will not offer timeslots near the end of the term and you may be locked out before allocating your credits to your desired course. Further instruction on how to use the HSP online system can be found at https://psych.ubc.ca/undergraduate/opportunities/human-subject-pool/ in the document entitled “Subject Pool Information for Participants.” PSYC304-002 Autumn 2023 syllabus 7 As an alternative to participation in psychology subject pool experiments, you may complete a library-writing project. Such projects consist of reading and summarizing 1) the research question, 2) the methods and 3) the results (in written form) of a research article from the peer reviewed journal Psychological Science. You will receive one (1) research participation credit for each article summary that meets the following requirements: · The article must have been published in the journal titled “Psychological Science” · The article must have a publication date from the year 2000 to present (i.e. papers from 2001 are acceptable; those from 1999 or earlier are not) · The article must be a research article; it cannot be a review article, a news item, a notice, or a letter to the editor, for example · The summary should be approximately 500 words in length · You must include your name, student number, course, section, instructor and email address on each summary · You must log on to the Human Subject Pool (HSP) system (http://hsp.psych.ubc.ca/) and create an account before submitting your article summaries. Your credit is assigned using the online system. Library-writing projects must be submitted no later than 10 days before the end of classes. You may obtain any or all of your research participation credits through the library option. You must submit your article and your summary to turnitin.com. If you don’t have a turnitin account already (from a previous course), you will need to create a user account in Turnitin. For the library assignment the class ID is 40264948, class name is \"HSP W1 2023-2024\" and password is \"Research\". See www.turnitin.com, and click on the “Training” link at the top of the page for detailed instructions on how to submit papers to Turnitin. Any student who is suspected of plagiarism will, at a minimum, not be granted credit, and their course instructor will be notified. Further action may be taken at a departmental or university level. HSP Online Study Credit Limit (NEW PILOT PROGRAM): We will no longer have an online credit limit. Instead, students are free to receive their HSP bonus credits from any combination of “in-lab” and “online” studies. However, “in-lab” studies will offer a bonus 0.5 credits on top of the standard 0.5 credits per 30 minutes of participation (e.g., a 1 hour “in-lab” study will award 1.5 credits, while an equivalent “online” study will award 1 credit). PSYC304-002 Autumn 2023 syllabus 8 Grading In order to reduce grade inflation and maintain equity across course sections, all psychology courses are required to comply with departmental norms for grade distributions. According to departmental norms, the mean grade in a 300-level class is 75% for a good class, 73% for an average class, and 71% for a weak class (with a standard deviation of 14%). Scaling may be used in order to comply with these norms; grades may be scaled up or down as necessary by the instructors or the department. Grades are not official until they appear on your transcript. You will receive both a percent and a letter grade for this course. At UBC, your course percentage is converted to a letter grade according to the following key: A+: 90-100% A: 85-89% A-: 80-84% B+: 76-79% B: 72-75% B-: 68-71% C+: 64-67% C: 60-63% C-: 55-59% D: 50-54% F: 0-49% Because you are earning a degree at a highly reputable post-secondary institution, the criteria for success are high. The Faculty of Arts offers the following guidelines that broadly characterize the kind of work that is generally associated with the particular grade ranges. These characteristics help put the Psychology Department grading policies into perspective. Please note that adequate performance is in the C range. A Range: Exceptional Performance. Strong evidence of original thinking; good organization in written work; capacity to analyze (i.e. break ideas down) and to synthesize (i.e. bring different ideas together in a coherent way); superior grasp of subject matter with sound critical evaluations; evidence of extensive knowledge base. B Range: Competent Performance. Evidence of grasp of subject matter; some evidence of critical capacity and analytic ability; reasonable understanding of relevant issues; evidence of familiarity with the literature. C-D Range: Adequate Performance. Understanding of the subject matter; ability to develop solutions to simple problems in the material; acceptable but uninspired work; not seriously faulty but lacking style and vigor. F Range: Inadequate Performance. Little or no evidence of understanding of the subject matter; weakness in critical and analytical skills; limited or irrelevant use of the literature. Statement on equity, diversity, and inclusion Adapted from materials supplied by Psychology’s Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion committee: Similar to the broader UBC community, the Psychology Department—and this class— seeks to build a community where students feel included and are treated equitably. This class aims to be inclusive of gender identity, gender expression, sex, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, political affiliation, religious affiliation, ability, health, and age (this is not an exhaustive list!). As is the nature of psychology courses, the lecture materials, textbook, instructor, or other students may sometimes raise sensitive and/or controversial topics. In these circumstances, we must keep discussion respectful and productive. Our classroom is a place where you should feel safe and respected. It should also be a place that is conducive to learning and PSYC304-002 Autumn 2023 syllabus 9 intellectual inquiry. Any behaviour on your part that compromises that environment will not be tolerated and you will be asked to leave. If you encounter any issues with the inclusivity of our class, please get in touch with either myself or the TA. You can also learn more about our diversity initiatives in the Department of Psychology by visiting https://psych.ubc.ca/about/equity-inclusion/. Academic integrity and avoiding misconduct The following is adapted from materials provided by the Department of Psychology and the Faculty of Arts: In the academic community—a community of which you are now a part—we deal in ideas. That’s our currency, our way of advancing knowledge. By representing our own and others’ contributions in an honest way, we are (1) respecting the rules of this academic community, and (2) showcasing how our own novel ideas are distinct from but relate to their ideas. APA style gives us a formal way to indicate where our ideas end and where others’ begin. But academic integrity goes well beyond formal citation. Welcome to the academic community! We are all expected to act honestly and ethically in all our academic activities. Make sure you understand UBC’s definitions of academic misconduct and consequences. Please ask if you’re not sure. (You might also want to check out the “Student Declaration and Responsibility” statement you agreed to when you registered.) What does academic integrity look like in this course? If at any time you are unsure if a certain type of assistance is authorized, please ask. If you have a need that is unmet by existing course materials, course structure, and/or our learning community members, please ask. In the meantime, here are some guiding principles for what academic integrity looks like: Do your own work. All individual work that you submit should be completed by you and submitted by you. All assessments, large and small, are designed to help you learn the material. It is unacceptable to use an editor (paid or unpaid) without my permission to revise, correct, or alter your work, because your submission is no longer your own work. It is unacceptable to buy/sell/swap/share assignment questions or answers on any platform. It is unacceptable to misrepresent your identity by using someone else to complete any portion of a course (e.g. a quiz question). It is unacceptable to help someone else cheat. Avoid collusion. Collusion is a form of academic integrity violation that involves working too closely together without authorization, such that the resulting submitted work gains unfair advantage over other students, because it is a measurement of the group/pair/others’ understanding rather than the individual understanding (definition adapted from OpenLearn). For example, collusion on a test includes working together to write answers or answering someone else’s question in a WhatsApp chat. There are no assignments in this course that are the product of group collaboration, so please do not collaborate on any exams, quizzes, or projects. Preparing to individually complete an assignment or test by studying together (e.g. discussing concepts, quizzing each other and giving feedback on each other’s answers during studying) doesn’t count as collusion. PSYC304-002 Autumn 2023 syllabus 10 Can I work with a classmate to co-create study notes? Yes, you can create your own original collaborative notes. Can I use my notes as a study aid while writing the exam? No, exams will be closed-book and you can’t use study aids. Can I use ChatGPT or other AI tools at all? Sort of. You can use AI tools like ChatGPT to prepare for your exam, much like working with other students. However, you can NOT use ChatGPT during the quiz, or the exam (obviously), or to write any HSP library option materials for you, or to complete any assessment materials in this course. The assessments in our course are designed to be an assessment of your learning. As such, you must complete your own work. Do not share materials provided for you to use in this course. We are working hard to provide all the materials you need to succeed in this course. In return, please respect our work and the enormous efforts that went into making this class. All assignment instructions, quiz questions and answers, discussion questions, announcements, PowerPoint slides, audio/video recordings, Canvas modules, and any other materials provided to you by myself or the TAs are for use in this course by students currently enrolled in this course. It is unacceptable to share any of these materials beyond our course, including by posting on file-sharing websites (e.g., CourseHero, GoogleDocs). Please respect our intellectual property and hard work on this. Acknowledge others’ ideas. Scholars build on the work of others, and give credit accordingly—this is a quality of strong academic work. Citing sources in both formal and informal ways will be essential, and appropriate, depending on the assignment. Learn to avoid unintentional plagiarism. Visit the Learning Commons’ guide to academic integrity to help you organize your writing as well as understand how to prevent unintentional plagiarism, which can be challenging when first learning to paraphrase. Visit http://learningcommons.ubc.ca/resource-guides/avoiding-plagiarism/. An example tip: Do not copy and paste text from other sources, including other people’s work, even in a draft. It’s easy to unintentionally misrepresent those words as your own in a later draft. Other Course Policies During your time in this course, if you encounter medical, emotional, or other personal problems that affect your attendance or academic performance, please notify me as soon as possible, as well as your Faculty Academic Advising Office. Please refer to the UBC Calendar for a discussion of academic concession. The university accommodates students with disabilities who have registered with the Centre for Accessibility office (see below). The university also accommodates students whose religious obligations conflict with attendance or scheduled exams. Please let me know in advance, by September 15 th if possible, if you will require any accommodation on these grounds. Other absences (e.g. varsity athletics, family obligations, or similar) are not part of the university policy and you should not assume they will be accommodated. Please discuss these with me by September 15 th. The Centre for Accessibility (previously Access & Diversity). UBC is committed to equal opportunity in education for all students including those with documented physical or learning PSYC304-002 Autumn 2023 syllabus 11 disabilities. If you believe you fall in this category, please visit the website for the Centre for Accessibility (https://students.ubc.ca/about/access) to take the necessary steps to ensure that you have every opportunity that you deserve to excel in your studies. Points to remember!: • Productive classroom questions are encouraged. • You are responsible for all readings and lecture materials. • Lecture slides will be available on Canvas. However, the core material is within the lecture itself, not the slides, so be sure to attend the lecture. • Lecture slides will be posted on Canvas in advance. This is done as a courtesy, and occasionally might be delayed. • Lecture audio will also be posted on Canvas. This audio will be sub-optimal and is not guaranteed, but should be there for those who cannot attend due to (e.g.) illness. • Please be aware that some of the content in this course can be challenging for those without some background in biology. I will provide additional, optional reading sources for you to pursue, should you request it.
