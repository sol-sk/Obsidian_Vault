Cognitive technology • an extremely potent cognitive technology: language • ability to create tokens representing complex relationships Equality is not the same as equity. Cognitive technology • why are languages so much like PSSs? 1. the human brain is also a PSS 2. to complement the operation of our fundamentally connectionist brains Cognitive technology • mental imagery vs. external images","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
