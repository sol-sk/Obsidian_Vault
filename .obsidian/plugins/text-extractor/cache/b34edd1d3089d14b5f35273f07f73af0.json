Keep the researcher/experimenter and participant blind to the hypothesis of the study Have a computer run the study, minimising interactions between researcher and participant 7 Interaction effects ▪ Various social components of the researcher/participant interaction may affect the results ▫ Biosocial effect ▫ Psychosocial effect ▪ Example: 8 Practical Considerations ▪ How to design study to maximize chances of detecting effect if it’s there? ▪ Optimizing our operational definitions of the IV and the DV ▫ Avoiding ceiling and floor effects ▫ Appropriate pairing of IV and DV 9Ceiling vs. Floor Effects: not all DVs are created equal 10 Ceiling effect Too easy Everybody does very well Very little variability Hard to see effect of IV 11 Floor effect Too difficult Everybody does very poorly Very little variability Hard to see effect of IV 12 Example Study: 13 Strength of IV Sensitivity of DV Strong Weak Tough SensitiveWeak 14 Strength of IVs and Sensitivity of DVs IV (Manipulation) DV (Measurement Instrument or the construct itself) Good shot at creating a big change in DV Resistant to change Good at making fine distinctions in DVs, but usually can’t create big effects Changes easily 15 Strength of IVs and Sensitivity of DVs IV (Manipulation) DV (Measurement Instrument or the construct itself) Charitability manipulation: Your ticket just won you $1 million! Willingness to donate $1 million Charitability manipulation: Imagine some guy winning $1 million. Feeling charitable 16 Strength of IVs and Sensitivity of DVs IV (Manipulation) DV (Measurement Instrument or the construct itself) Immersive manipulation: Play series of particularly violent missions Willingness to stab someone Thought manipulation: Think about playing Atari Boxing Killing ants 17 Practical Considerations ▪ How do we design the study to maximize the chances that we’ll be able to ▫ Conclude that the IV caused changes in the DV? ■ Experimental control, including ruling out potential alternative explanations (e.g., expectancy effects, demand characteristics) ▫ Detect an effect if it’s there? ■ Optimize our operational definitions 18 Learning objectives ▪ By the end of next class, you should be able to ▫ Discuss different types of IVs and DVs commonly used in research ▫ Create different types of DVs to evaluate a claim ▫ Understand the different types of between- and within-subjects designs ▫ Understand the advantages and disadvantages associated with within-subjects designs ▫ Manage disadvantages of within-subjects designs ▫ Describe the relationship between strength of IV/sensitivity of DV and experimental designs 19 Key Terms OD of IV manipulation Straightforward Staged OD of outcome variable Self-report Behavioural Physiological Quantitative variables 20 Manipulating the IV: Straightforward Manipulation ▪ Simple and easy ▪ Present participants with something that will influence DV ▪ Examples: ▫ Music  Mood ▫ Movies  Heart rate 21 Manipulating the IV: Staged Manipulation ▪ Try to indirectly elicit a state ▪ Make participants feel like they’re in the situation ▪ Example: ▫ Using confederates to make participants feel excluded ▫ Diffusion of responsibility studies","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
