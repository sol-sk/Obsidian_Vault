Warm-up Assembly Groups Mock Assembly B. “I knew that when the great guiding spirit cleaves humanity into two antagonistic halves, I would be with the people.” A. “Famished, we decided to cast off the little shame that stubbornly remained, and to sort ourselves out at the local hospital. This time it was Alberto who was overcome with a strange timidity, and I had to find the right words to intone the following diplomatic speech: “Doctor” — we found one in the hospital — “I am a medical student, my companion is a biochemist. We are both from Argentina and we are hungry. We would like to eat.” C. “The two days I’d planned stretched like elastic into eight and with the bittersweet taste of goodbye mingling with my inveterate bad breath I finally felt myself lifted definitively away on the winds of adventure toward worlds I envisaged would be stranger than they were, into situations I imagined would be much more normal than they turned out to be.” D. “On top of her asthma, she had a heart condition. It is at times like this, when a doctor is conscious of his complete powerlessness, that he longs for change: a change to prevent the injustice of a system in which only a month ago this poor woman was still earning her living as a waitress, wheezing and panting but facing life with dignity.” Warm-up: Quote ordering & analysis! Using your knowledge of The Motorcycle Diaries, talk with your peers to decide on the order that these four quotes appear in the text. Together, try to contextualize these quotes. Then, briefly analyze each one. What do they reveal to us about Che and his physical journey, but also his self-journey? GROUP 1 Madison Wilde Rohtab Danny Castillo Rae Hu Mathew Assembly Groups!

Inspired, he recalls the words of Venezuelan poet Miguel Otero Silva (see left). Read the poem together. Take a moment to further contextualize this poem within The Motorcycle Diaries, if necessary. Then, discuss the following questions: 1) To begin, what images stand out to you? What literary devices do you notice in Otero Silva’s poem? 2) What is Ernesto’s purpose of reciting the words of this poem? Who is his audience? How does he view himself at this point in his journey? 3) What is Alberto’s reaction to this “lovesick pause”? Does this dynamic continue to define their relationship throughout their journey? 4) Recall how you initially read/reacted to Che in this chapter. Now that we have read the entire journey, do you view this early chapter (or Che) differently? I heard splashing on the boat her bare feet And sensed in our faces the hungry dusk My heart swaying between her and the street, the road I don’t know where I found the strength to free myself from her eyes to slip from her arms She stayed, crying through rain and glass clouded with grief and tears She stayed, unable to cry Wait!
