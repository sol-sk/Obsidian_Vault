Activating these receptors inhibit GABA neurons, disinhibits dopamine neurons-DAInhibitory GABA neuronOpioids work here to inhibit GABA neuron4•Withdrawal: 6-12 hrs after last dose, restlessness. watery eyes, nose, sweating followed by a fitful sleep for several hours–Opioids depress CNS function; opioid withdrawal is rebound hyperactivity.–The symptoms are typically worst on the 2nd-3rd day and disappear by the 7th day•Long-term health consequences: Main risks of the I.V. user is risk of O.D. (either due to using street drugs of unknown potency or conditioned tolerance effects) and use of second-hand needlesOpiates(II)•Other health consequences of long-term use are relatively minor: constipation, pupil constriction, menstrual irregularity, reduced libido•Recent work suggest that long-term cognitive deficits are associated with chronic heroin abuse5•High addictive potentialPsychostimulants (Cocaine, Amphetamines)–Psychological effects: increased self-confidence, alertness, energy, makes people friendly and talkative–Physiological effects: motor activation (fidgety), appetite, need for sleep, arousal, cardiovascular tone•Addicts typically abuse in “sprees”; binges where high levels of intake are maintained for 1-3 days–Sprees end when $$$ runs out or toxicity develops•Withdrawal: “the crash” -fatigue, increased appetite, depression, anhedonia, anxiety, irritability, sometimes agitation or extreme suspicion. Also accompanied by increase drug craving.–Withdrawal symptoms tend to be more prominent with amphetamines (particularly methamphetamine) vs cocaine–Many times, physicalwithdrawal symptoms are not as visibly apparent at they are for other drugs 6Actions of Cocaine and AmphetaminesNormal DA transmission: DA is released by presynaptic terminal, but is quickly taken back by the DA transporterCocaine: blocks the DA transporter, so DA that has been released stays out a lot longerAmphetamines: Reverses the DA transporter, so more DA is released and stays out a lot longer-Both work on multiple monoamine systems (NE, 5-HT), but reinforcing effects mediated via by actions on DADopamine TransporterDACocaine works hereDAAmphetamines work hereDAX7Psychostimulant Toxicity•Numerous adverse consequences with long-term use–Psychosis, seizures, brain damage to monoamine system, strokes, heart attacks•Brain damage may be the result of strokes (vasoconstriction via noradrenaline release) or DA-induced toxicity (too much of a good thing)•Many stimulant abusers display deficits in cognitive functions mediated by the PFC, which can persist for years after drug abstinence.8Psychostimulants-Therapeutic Effects•At lower doses (ie: those used for recreational use)psychostimulants like d-amphetamine (Adderall™) or methylphenidate (Ritalin™) have therapeutic benefits •Powerful stimulant: promotes wakefulness–Amphetamine given to WW II military personnel to reduce their need for sleep –Still prescribed in for some type of sleep disorders like narcolepsy –One key side effect = reduces R.E.M. sleep•Cognitive enhancer: enhances multiple forms of cognitionAttention, working memory, memory encoding―Enhances cognitive function in healthy human subjects and in certain psychiatric disorders (ADHD, schizophrenia)―Many of these effects are though to be mediated by enhancing DA and noradrenaline activity in the prefrontal cortex―However, enhancement of these functions comes at the sacrifice of other functions (e.g.; creative thought)9Theories of Drug Addiction (I)•Physical Dependence Model:Drug taking is driven by desire to reduce withdrawal symptoms–Problems: Addicts often relapse when withdrawal symptoms have passed; some drugs do not have severe withdrawal symptoms (i.e.: cocaine)–Detoxified addicts (drugs eliminated from system) still remain addicted–Treatments used to curb withdrawal (e.g. nicotine patch) are not 100% effective–Note: some emotional effects of drug withdrawal (depressed mood, reduced motivation, irritability) may persist for some time after physicalwithdrawal symptoms have ceased-this may contributeto persistence of addiction. 10•Positive Reward Model: addicts take drugs for the pleasurable feelings–Problem: addicts can continue to seek/take drugs even if they are no longer giving as good a “rush” they have felt in the past (i.e.: tolerance to the hedonic effects have occurred)–Some drugs (eg; nicotine) do not give as much of a euphoric rush as other drugs (eg: heroin) but can be just as addictiveTheories of Drug Addiction (II)11Drug infusion pumpDopamine and Animal Models of Drug Reward•REDUCING DA TRANSMISSION reduces/ abolishesself administration for most drugs‒Blocking DA receptors also disruptsformation of conditioned place preference for drugs•Responding for drugs of abuse is associated with DA release in the accumbens•DA release is also increased by consumption of natural rewards and/or presentation of reward-associated cues–However, magnitude of DA release by drugs of abuse can be greater/prolonged than that induced by natural rewardsDopamine response for foodSo, drugs of abuse activate the brain’s natural reward learning pathways, but to a much greater degree12Dopamine and Drugs of Abuse-what it’s not•So, rewards are pleasurable, rewards increase dopamine release, so dopamine is pleasure?•Note that “Reward” has 2 components–“Liking” = pleasurable, hedonic effects of rewards –“Wanting” = craving, willingness to work for rewardsStudy:Blockade of dopamine receptors in humans does not alter subjective ratings of drug euphoria•It is now relatively well-accepted (by mostscientists) that dopamine is not involvedin the pleasurable effects of drugs of abuse (or natural rewards)DOPAMINE BlockerControl Mean “Euphoric” ratingDopamine antagonism does not affect reported euphoria induced by amphetamine•Dopamine more involved in the preparatory/approach behaviours associated with rewards and conditioned stimuli, NOT their pleasurable effects—Endogenous opioids (e.g.: endorphins) play a role in pleasurable aspects of rewardsSo, dopamine helps get you to the good things in life (wanting), but doesn’t seem to be involved in you liking them13Pavlovian Approach(Autoshaping): Cue comes on, predicts food delivery 10 s laterFood ALWAYS delivered, regardless of whether animal interacts with leverOver training, animals start to approach/ press/bite lever while waiting for food to be delivered –cue becomes attractive, elicits approachTick…Tick…Tick…654321# cue contacts during CSBlocking NAcDA receptorsreduce approach to cue (but DOES NOT disrupt approach/consumption of food reward)Dopamine and Approach Towards Reward-Related StimuliControlBlocking DA in NAcSo, dopamine promotes behaviors directed towards reward-related stimuli","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
