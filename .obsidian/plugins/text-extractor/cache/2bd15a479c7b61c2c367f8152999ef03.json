The foundations of modern cognitive science Behaviourism • ﬁrst half of 20th century • psychology as an experimental science • my generation of cognitive scientists: Anyone knows what behaviourists actually said / did? I mean no one ever taught us anything about them… The foundations of modern cognitive science Behaviourism • ﬁrst half of 20th century • psychology as an experimental science • previous generation of cognitive scientists: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrQ0LfqxABM The foundations of modern cognitive science https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrQ0LfqxABM Behaviourism • ﬁrst half of 20th century • psychology as an experimental science • previous generation of cognitive scientists: The foundations of modern cognitive science Behaviourism • main issue: stimulus–behaviour with no middle man (i.e. mind!) • (side note: similar issue in linguistic structuralism) psychological processes representations hidden layers The foundations of modern cognitive science Computation • the birth of computing machines: computation (≈ cognition / thought) as a physically fully speciﬁed & implemented process • the Turing Machine (“a-machine”) • ﬁrst physically implemented electronic computers in 1940s/1950s Representation and Computation Representation and Computation • viewing cognition as the operation of computational processes on representations • 1950s onwards • focus on the middle-man between stimulus and behaviour – the mind • (+ a lot of pooh-poohing of behaviourism) Representation and Computation Representation and Computation • viewing cognition as the operation of computational processes on representations • parallel development of: • modern computers & programming Ls • models of cognition mind = ? computer Neural networks Neural networks • fully implemented computational devices inspired by the brain • also around the 1950s! brain computer Neural networks Neural networks • fully implemented computational devices inspired by the brain Neural networks Neural networks • fully implemented computational devices inspired by the brain • two prominent false(ish) starts • 1950s (the so-called perceptron) • 1980s (parallel distributed processing) Neural networks Deep Neural Networks • cleverly designed neural networks with multiple hidden layers can discover patterns in data without explicit guidance • starting around the 2000s Neural networks Deep Neural Networks • cleverly designed neural networks with multiple hidden layers can discover patterns in data without explicit guidance • many practical applications (cf. AI) • Siri on iPhones • Google Translate • self-driving cars • ChatGPT, Dall-E Neural networks Deep Neural Networks • cleverly designed neural networks with multiple hidden layers can discover patterns in data without explicit guidance • strong applied skew, but beginning to inform theoretical research in cognitive science more and more Mind ≠ Brain Extended Mind • cognition is not limited to the human brain and relies on many diﬀerent external (or sometimes internal) cognitive tools • physical: calculator, pen & paper, ﬁling systems, computers, mobile devices • behavioural: language, making drafts/ sketches, visualisation, etc. Mind ≠ Brain Cultural evolution • cognitive tools and culture are the products of a long process of cultural evolution • features of cultural evolution may explain many properties of cognition that were previously attributed directly to the brain","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
