Keeps your metabolism guessing•Our current environment is “pathological”, not our weight problems–Many times, radical lifestyle change is needed to lose weight•Lots of confusion and conflicting advice.•Shocking lackof properly conducted scientific experiments for many of these diets, especially long term.•Macronutrients–“standard” advice is 50% carbs, 30% fat, 20% protein–by calories–low fat vs. low carbohydrateFor your benefit-not on exam10Psych 304-1stMidterm Term 2: February 1st, 2024–Lectures will following Tuesday resume after reading break, starting with Ch. 14 (Sleep)•40 Marks for the entire exam –80 min to complete•24 multiple choice, 1 mark each, testing on 2 chapters(Ch.12, sex; Ch.13, homeostasis feeding)–12 question from each chapter; 4 choices (a-d)–Questions will be presented in order of lectures–Some questions will be straightforward (covered in video/live lectures and text)–Others: Tricky (more obscure stuff; integrating 2-3 bits of information, trickier distractors)–Any question that has boldor italicized fonts, PAY ATTENTION! This may be a key word/term that will influence how you interpret the question and pick your answer.11Multiple Choice (continued)–There is only one correct answer (some may seem like they have more than one correct answer-these have particularly tricky distractors).–No questions were made up where the answers cannot be found (or figured out) with information given in the lectures (and sometimes textbook)–ALL of the m/c questions come from material that were covered at least in part in the lectures (ie: no questions come exclusively from the textbook). –~5 multiple choice questions test on content exclusivelyfrom the lectures.–READ EVERY QUESTION CAREFULLY–BRING PENCILS!!!! BRING ERASERS!!!!!12What the midterm will look like•Written Portion-16 marks–Short Answers (2) (8 marks each)–This section will have one question each asking about content from 2 chapters (Ch.12, Sex; Ch.13, Homeostasis-feeding) –ONE QUESTION may have more than one correct answer (i.e. there are multiple points you can make that will get you to full marks).–The number of points a question is worth is roughly the number of points you should list to obtain full marks (e.g.: if it’s a 8 mark question, you should write down 8-9 points you know about the topic). –Point form is acceptable–Diagrams are fine, as long as they are labeled clearly–Anything from the lecture slides is fair game1313What you will (not) be responsible for (a non-exhaustive list)•Chapter 12:NOT responsible for ”Pheromones Guide Reproductive Behaviorand“Parental Care” section •Chapter 13:NOT responsible for “Temperature Regulation” of “Fluid Regulation” sections (but all of sections 13.4, 13.5, 13.6)14What happens on exam day•The exam invigilator will be giving the exam (your instructor will show up about 15 min into it). •PLEASE FILL IN YOUR NAME AND STUDENT NUMBER (and write it down too in the boxes provided).•IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to ask the TA/instructor for clarification on an exam question•Read the exam over before starting. If there are any questions, save them for your instructor.•Your Scantronsheet and your multiple choice booklet MUST BE TURNED IN at the end of the exam. 15•If you miss the exam, you mustlet your instructors ANDTAs know as soon as possible to see if we can arrange a make-up exam.–If you cannot make up this exam, I will discuss how your final mark will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis•There is a zero tolerance policy on cheating–Exams not turned in IN class will not be graded; it is your responsibility to make sure that the TA receives your exam–The Dept. of Psychology has instituted cheating detection software for m/c exams.–PLEASE keep your eyes on your own papers, and don’t show off your papers to others…. Missing the Exam/Cheating16Study hints/exam tips•Know your brain circuits/hormonal cascades/pathways/drug effects•The majority of questions are on topics that are covered in both textbook AND lectures–~85% of the marks can be obtained from information that was covered in both the lectures and textbook (the remainder, just from the lecture notes)•DO NOT LEAVE ANY QUESTIONS BLANK–If you don’t know a multiple choice answer, guess–If you don’t know a short answer, write down SOMETHING, you may get part marks","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
