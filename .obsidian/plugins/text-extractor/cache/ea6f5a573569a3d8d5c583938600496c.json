At bycheung.teaching@gmail.com 3 Learning objectives By the end of this class, you’ll be able to ▫ Describe different ways in which questionnaires are administered ▫ Understand the role of the EAR ▫ Define probability and non-probability sampling ▫ Understand and apply probability and non-probability sampling techniques ▫ Recognise generalisability issues with regards to probability and non-probability sampling techniques ▫ Explain different ways of doing studies beyond relying on single studies 4 Alternative ways of doing research ▪ Special designs in which qualitative research is often found 5 Alternative ways of doing research 6 Alternative ways of measuring ▪ So far… 7 Questionnaires – How? ▪ Administered in person: ▫ Characteristic of most research in psychology ▫ Easy and inexpensive to administer ▫ More easily control “test-taking” environment ▫ Requires easy access to target sample 8 Questionnaires – How? ▪ Mailed surveys ▫ Allows researchers to reach samples to which they do not have easy access ▫ More expensive than paper questionnaire ▫ Logistically more difficult, esp. regarding compensation ▫ No control over “test-taking” environment 9 Questionnaires – How? ▪ Internet-based ▫ Access to massive sample size, frees researchers from many physical constraints ▫ Extremely inexpensive ▫ No control over “test-taking” environment ▫ Difficult to verify authenticity and demographics 10 Questionnaires – How? With mailed and internet surveys, lack of control in environment often translates into more noise in people scores (i.e. larger variances) How does this affect power? And how can we, as researchers, compensate for this? 11 Questionnaires – How? ▪ What may be some issues with asking participants questions about what they felt and thought about previously? ▪ Or asking them about why they feel a certain way? ▪ Memories may be biased! ▫ Current mood may bias memories of previous week ▪ People don’t often have access to subconscious mental processes 12 Questionnaires – How? ▪ On-line (not online) measures ▫ Take measures/record data in real time, or as things happen ▫ Done using special programs or instruments (e.g. smartphone apps, EAR) ▫ EAR = Electronically Activated Recorder ■ Small clip-on microphone and digital sound recorder ■ At every pre-set interval, EAR records 30 seconds of ambient sound 13 Questionnaires – How? ▪ Over 6 years, Mehl et al. (2007) asked people to wear an EAR for about a week ▪ Purpose: Do women really talk more than men? Gender Average words spoken per day Women (n = 210) 16,215 Men (n = 186) 15,669 14 Questionnaires – How? ▪ t-test! ▫ tobt = 0.68 ▫ tcrit = 1.97 ▪ Verdict? Gender Average words spoken per day Women (n = 210) 16,215 Men (n = 186) 15,669 15 Recruitment – Sampling techniques 16 Recruitment – Sampling techniques ▪ Two broad categories of sampling techniques: ▫ Probability sampling ■ Participants are randomly drawn ■ Likely representative of population ■ High generalisability ▫ Non-probability sampling ■ Participants not drawn at random ■ Easy and convenient ■ Low generalisability 17 Probability sampling ▪ Simple random sampling ▫ Everyone in a population has equal chance of being chosen UBC PSYC 217-003/004/010 Marleigh Atrina Aditi Abbi 18 Probability sampling ▪ Cluster sampling ▫ If “clusters” exist within a population, randomly sample clusters rather than individual members UBC PSYC 217-003/004/010 Ni/Irene’s Lab groups Thalia/Bronwen ’s Lab groups Ruoning/Vasileia’s Lab groups Malina/Zahra’s Lab groups 19 Probability sampling ▪ Stratified random sampling ▫ Identify subgroups within population ▫ Identify proportion of people in population belonging to subgroups ▫ Randomly draw samples from subgroups to reflect proportion in population UBC PSYC 217- 003/004/010 European-descent students 10% Indigenous students 10% West/Central Asian- descent students 20% East/South/Southeast Asian-descent students 58% South American- descent students 1% African-descent students 1% 20 Random assignment vs. Random sampling ▪ Random assignment: ▫ Every participant has equal chance of being in any experimental condition in a study ■ Allows for high internal validity ▪ Random sampling (Random selection): ▫ Every person in the population has equal chance of being chosen to participate in the study ■ Allows for high external validity (generalisability) 21 Random assignment vs. Random sampling Random Assignment to Condition? Yes No Random Selection from Population? Yes No Internal validity ↑ External validity ↑ Internal validity ↓ External validity ↑ Internal validity ↑ External validity ↓ Internal validity ↓ External validity ↓ 22 True randomness? Whole population People you can find People who say yes People who follow through","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
