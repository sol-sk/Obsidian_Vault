What does it mean to say, “The brain is not a hard drive, and the eye is not a camera”? i.e. What does it mean to say that perception is active? 2. Describe numerous examples of active perceptual processing, both in this lecture and the previous. 3. Describe parallel processing and its relation to the visual system. 4. Describe separate systems for processing visual information in the retina. 5. Describe a receptive field, and how it varies across the visual system. 6. Describe separate pathways for visual information from retina to thalamus to cortex. 7. What two theories describe colour vision? Are they mutually exclusive or complementary? Do they completely describe colour perception? Describe the putative neural mechanisms for each theory, and what else might account for our perception of colour. 8. How does the visual cortex turn basic light stimulus into perceptions? 9. Describe separate pathways for processing information in the cortex. What do these suggest about discrete damage to visual areas? 3 DARPA Grand Challenge 2004 Intro 4 Where are we today? Intro 5 A selective, active process Intro 6 A selective, active process Intro 7 Reminder: vision has a restricted range Based on evolutionary usefulness Varies by species As ever, has a biological basis Intro Adaptation – A consequence of constant stimulation – Influences how the world is perceived in a personally useful way – Explains why we (usually) don’t see the blood vessels in our eyes – Thus, we need constant eye movement (saccades) to prevent the world from fading Intro 9 The retina A messy path to travel 10The retina Reminder: a less messy path to travel 11 The cornea and lens focus images on retina The retina 12The retina A well organized structure • Many translucent layers • ~130 million photoreceptors • Photoreceptors convert light into neural activityLight 13The retina A well organized structureLight Note 1: graded potentials 14The retina Specialized function 15The retina Specialized function Rods (scotopic) • Long, thin, cylindrical • Highly sensitive to light Cones (photopic) • Short, thick, tapered • Less sensitive to light Note 2: signal causes hyperpolarization via GPCRs 16The retina Function influences localization 17The retina Rods • ~120 million cells • Very sensitive to light • Not sensitive to wavelength of light • Located everywhere except fovea • Critical for vision at night (convergence) • Explains why colour vision is poor in low light • Easily “bleached” during the day • Important for perceiving movement 18The retina Cones • ~7 million cells • Less sensitive to light, but • Sensitive to wavelength of light • Three types of cones • Located mostly in the fovea (explains why fovea less useful at night) • Critical for perceiving colour • Important for acuity (not cones per se…) 19 Rods and cones have different sensitivities of wavelength The retina 20The retina Most mammals have dichromatic colour vision 21The retina Colour blindness in humans 22 Protanopia DeuteranopiaTrichromatic colour vision Tritanopia Achromatopsia The retina Acquired trichromacy • Brain can make sense of new information • Therapeutic (and science fiction!) implications 23 The retina Parallel processing, convergence 24The retina Pro’s and con’s + High sensitivity – Low acuity 25The retina Pro’s and con’s + High acuity – Low sensitivity WHY HAVE BOTH? 26 Lateral inhibition and Mach bands We are built to detect contrast, not to sense absolute values Receptive fields 27Receptive fields Relative, not absolute values • Centre-surround organization • Contrast enhancement 28Receptive fields How to measure receptive fields 29Receptive fields ON and OFF channels 30Receptive fields ON and OFF channels via lateral inhibition 31 Lateral Inhibition in the Retina Receptive fields 32 A messy path to travel 2: the revenge Pathways 33 Optic nerve, chiasm, tract Pathways 34 Cutting the optic chiasm Pathways 35 The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) Pathways 36 Specialized processing continues Pathways Handy mnemonic: P is for perception M is for motion 37 Welcome to V1, the primary visual cortex Visual Cortex 38 aka Brodmann Area 17 Striate cortex Retinotopic map Visual Cortex 39 Cortical magnification, again Simple cells Visual Cortex https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOHayh06LJ4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VdFf3egwfg 40 Ocular Dominance Columns Visual Cortex 41 Orientation Columns Visual Cortex 42 Colour perception: not simply wavelength Visual Cortex 43 Colour constancy Theories of colour • Colour processing occurs in two stages. – 1. Young-Helmholtz trichromatic theory Visual Cortex (well, this one is in the retina) 44 Theories of colour (part 1) • Colour processing occurs in two stages. – 2. Hering’s opponent process theory Visual Cortex (this one’s really cortex) 45 Theories of colour • Colour processing occurs in two stages. – 2. Hering’s opponent process theory Visual Cortex (this one’s really cortex) These two theories alone are still insufficient (i.e. a lot of colour perception is top-down) 46 Reminder: Perception is heavily influenced by top-down processes Visual Cortex 47 Perceptual constancy Reminder: Perception is heavily influenced by top-down processes Visual Cortex 48 Specialized processing continues! Visual Cortex 49 Parallel processing Visual Cortex 50 Specialized processing continues! Visual Cortex 51 Cortical damage may not affect all vision Visual Cortex Monkeys Patient D.F. 52 Is the Halle Berry neuron a visual neuron? Other visual processing 53 Non-conscious vision? Other visual processing Loss of vision ≠ loss of circadian rhythm Can’t consciously see (V1 damage) but can guess stimuli with higher-than-chance accuracy and navigate a room full of obstacles — “Blindsight” 54Summary Visual system: great model for the CNS • Active, not passive • Relative, not absolute • Parallel processing • Convergence and divergence • Contralateral, -topic organization 55","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
