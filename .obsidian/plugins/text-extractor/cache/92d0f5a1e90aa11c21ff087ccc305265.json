Calculate sample mean (ഥ𝑿) 2. Subtract mean from Xi for deviation scores 3. Square deviation scores 4. Sum squared deviation scores (SS) 5. Divide by N (or N-1) for variance (s2) 6. Square root for standard deviation (s) 2 Pop Quiz What is it? 3 Σ𝑋 𝑁 Σ(𝑋i – ത𝑋)2 Pop Quiz Say it! 4 Σ σ ത𝑋 β μ α Normal Curve The normal curve is like…[the smell of pine trees on the first warm day of spring] – Symmetric (not skewed) – Unimodal – Perfectly variable – Asymptotic tails – Known! 5 Area Under the Curve 6 InflectionInflection z-scores show how many σ‘s an observation is from μ 7 X1 0 𝑧 = 𝑋𝑖 − μ σ z-scores z-scores are a transformation – ത𝑋 has been subtracted from each obs. • ത𝑋/μ is now equal to 0 • Process known as “centering” the data – Each obs. divided by standard deviation • σ is now equal to 1 • Known as “standardizing” the data • Standard scores are comparable to each other – They now share the same ത𝑋 and σ 8 Calculating z-scores from a known pop. • μF = 162cm; σF = 7.1cm • μM = 175cm; σM = 7.4cm 9 𝑧 = 𝑋𝑖 − μ σ 𝑧 = 166 − 175 7.4 Where XAR = 166cm μM = 175cm σM = 7.4cm 𝑧 = −9 7.4 𝑧 = −1.22 How much area is under the curve?
