Some common issues: ■ Poorly worded questions (e.g. double-barrelled question, double negatives) ■ Effect of uncontrolled variables (e.g. environmental variables, distractions) ■ Small sample size ■ Between- versus Within-subject designs (Think: what are some sources of error in our DVs, which result in a lot of variability?) 𝑡𝑡 = �𝑋𝑋1− �𝑋𝑋2 𝑠𝑠1 2 𝑛𝑛1 + 𝑠𝑠2 2 𝑛𝑛2 3 Determining if two means are significantly different from each other ▪ 1. Find “t obtained” value ▫ Use formula to convert the mean difference and standard deviation into a t value ▪ 2. Refer to sampling distribution of t values ▫ Find “critical t” value for that df and alpha ▫ From the table (Appendix C, Table C.2) ▫ Don’t need to find this for 217 ▪ 3. Make a decision ▫ Is our statistic value sufficiently rare to consider it significant? ▫ Is absolute value of |tobt |> |tcrit|? ■ If yes, reject the null hypothesis ■ If no, retain the null hypothesis 4 Step 2: Refer to a sampling distribution for comparison ▪ t distribution is actually a family of distributions ▫ Corresponds to sample size – each sample size has a different t distribution ▫ Distribution of each possible t value if the null hypothesis is true, at each sample size H0 sampling distribution All possible t values 5 Step 2: Refer to a sampling distribution for comparison ▪ To locate the appropriate sampling distribution: ▫ Degrees of freedom (df) = N – 2 (total sample minus number of groups) ■ df is dependent on sample size, and more = better ▪ To locate the appropriate tcrit: ▫ Alpha level (α) ■ Stated as probability (0.00 to 1.00) – conventionally 0.05 ■ How likely are we to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis? ■ How likely are we to say that means are significantly different, but it’s actually due to chance? ■ If the null hypothesis is true, how likely are we to mistakenly say that the null hypothesis is not true? ▫ If |tobt| > |tcrit|, then we reject the null hypothesis 6 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 -1.96 N = ∞ 1.96 When alpha = .05, two tailed... 2.5% 2.5% .025 +.025 = .05 = α If tobt = 2.50, do we reject H0?

Otherwise, just looking at this picture itself will be confusing. 7 Reviewing inferential tests ▪ 𝑡𝑡obt > 𝑡𝑡crit , then reject null hypothesis ▫ This rule primarily works for non-directional research hypothesis (i.e. two-tailed tests) ▫ What about one-tailed tests? -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 1.65 -2.50 -1.90-3.00 8 t test and F test Obtained t ▪ Interval or Ratio DV ▪ Nominal IV ▫ Comparison between 2 levels of IV ▪ Calculation is a: ▫ Signal to Noise Ratio Obtained F ▪ Interval or Ratio DV ▪ Nominal IV ▫ Comparison between >2 levels of IV ▪ Calculation is a: ▫ Signal to Noise Ratio Under one particular condition, F = t2 9 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 N = 6 df = ? 2.80 2.78 ∵ tobt > tcrit ∴ reject null hypothesis α (two-tailed) = .05 p < .05 2.5%2.5% 10 Statistically Significant ▪ Statistically significant: ▫ Result is unlikely to be due to chance ▫ It is unlikely that the difference between the two groups has a t of 0 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 2.80 11 Inferential Statistics Overview ▪ Null & Research Hypotheses ▪ Sampling distribution ▪ t-test logic ▪ Statistically significant ▪ Type 1 and Type 2 errors ▪ Apply your understanding 12 Errors in Judgment ▪ 2 types of errors that we can make in making such decisions ▫ Type 1 error: ■ H0 is true in the population, but we rejected H0 ▫ Type 2 error: ■ H0 is not true in the population, but we retained it 13 Errors in Judgment What’s true in the Population? H0 is true H0 is not true Your Decision based on Sample Reject H0 Retain H0 Correct Decision Correct Decision Wrong Decision Wrong Decision 14 Errors in Judgment What’s true in the Population?
