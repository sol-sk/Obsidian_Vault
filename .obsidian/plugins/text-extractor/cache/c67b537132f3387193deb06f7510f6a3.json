Drop in blood glucose is preceded by increased insulin, so drop may have been actively produced (not a decline in “energy reserves”).3Factors that influence satiety(I)Previous experience about nutritive value of certain foods influences satiety•Sham eating experiment: Food is chewed, swallowed, passes out of the body (not digested). Rats given either normal lab chow (which they are used to) or novel food•With normal lab chow, rats start off eating same amount as before surgery. Give rats a novelfood-they eat more.Not until 4thmeal that rats are eating 3 times as much as normal. Even then they stop feeding.4Factors that influence satiety(II)Social Influences:Humansand animals eat more in groups vs alone–Study:When two individuals eat together, they tend to take “bites” together, eat similar amounts of foodSensory Specific Satiety: Humans and animals take in more calories if they are given varied (cafeteria, buffet) diet–Satiety can be taste specific: new taste = more consumption–Encourages consumption of varied diets and to take advantage when different foods are abundant–Study: humans asked to rate palatability of 8 foods, then given one of foods for meal–When asked again to rate same 8 foods, one they just ate got lower rating: when given new meal right after, they ate more.5Physiology of Hunger and SatietyVagus nerve (sends signals directly to brain)brainLiver can signal brain about what’s in the bloodstream via vagusnerve–Liver receives blood from small intestine; has detectorsfor glucose and fatty acids inside some cellsExperiment: inject chemicals that “trick” liver to act as if glucose/fat levels are low–2-deoxyglucose (2-DG)= competes with glucose for absorption, but doesn’t activate glucose detectors–Methyl palmoxirate= disrupts metabolism of fatty acids•Inject these drugs into vein from intestine liver = immediate increase in feeding•Cut vagusnerve = abolish effect of drug injection•Note: brain also has receptors for glucose (but not fats) in a number of regions. –Infusing 2-DG in certain brain regions also stimulates feeding 6Satiety/Hunger Signals: Body to Brain•Body uses multiple hormones to signal brain to start/stop eating•Food in gut, glucose in blood can initiate signals that suppress hungerbefore food is fully digested–From Stomach: CCK, bombesin, somatostatin –From Liver: detects changes in blood glucose, direct input to brain via vagusnerve (non-hormonal)–From Pancreas: Insulin–From Intestines: PYY3-36&GLP-1–From Fat Cells: Leptin, gives continuous feedback on body’s energy stores•Removal of fat gets rid of this satiety signal, increases hunger •Other peptides can stimulate feeding–From Stomach: Ghrelin, levels remain high during fasting, drop during meal (short term)7??Neural Basis of Hunger and Satiety(I)–Reinterpretation: VMH regulates energy metabolism, not eating.–VMH lesions increase insulin levels (which increases lipogenesis(fat formation) and decreases breakdown of body fat into usable forms)•Ventromedial Hypothalamus: Satiety center?–Lesion this nucleus, animals become obese–Starts with massive consumption that achieves new weight (dynamic phase) then maintenance of that weight (static phase) –Interpretation issues: Animals reach a new target weight, but do eventually stop eating in a session–Rats become “finicky” eaters: give rats less palatable food, VMH lesioned rats show minimal weight gain8VMH lesionsVMHBrainstem nucleiParaventricular nucleiPVN axons pass through VMHVMH lesionElectrolytic lesion of VMH destroys neurons in this nucleus ANDaxons running throughPVN lesion•Destroy PVN or axons = same obesity and hyperphagiaas VMH lesions–Neurons in VMH may not be what causes effects. These lesions also destroy axons projecting from theparaventricular nucleiof the hypothalamus. Lesions of these fibers alone also produce hyperphagiaand obesity.9•Lateral Hypothalamus: Hunger center?–Lesion caused rats to stop eating (aphagia)–Interpretation issues: force feed rats for a week, they eventually start eating again–Reinterpretation: LH lesions cause wide range of sensory and motor disturbances, including decreased appetite. Animals have problems with eating, but not lack of hunger.????•Control of hunger and satietyis distributed across many brain regions–Other hypothalamic subregions, as well as amygdala, frontal cortex are also involvedNeural Basis of Hunger and Satiety(II)10Neural Basis of Hunger and Satiety(III)•ArcuateNucleus of Hypothalamus: First-pass appetite control center–5 main Satiety/Hunger hormone signals from body interact with this nucleus to regulate feeding–Pancreas: Insulin(feeding)Fat Cells: Leptin (feeding)–Intestines: GLP1& PYY3-36(feeding)Stomach: Ghrelin(feeding)–These activate different types of neurons in arcuratenucleus, (defined by transmitters they use or proteins they express)•Neuropeptide Y (NPY) & agouti-related peptide (AgRP)–Activation of these cells appetite •Pro-opiomelanocortin(POMC) & Cocaine/Amphetamine regulated transcript (CART)–Activation of these cells appetite 11AgRP/NPY neuron (appetite)POMC/CART neuron (appetite)Arcuate NucleusLHPVN+Leptin/insulin-LH appetite stimulating functionLeptin & Insulin work as long term modulators of appetite•Activate POMC/CART neurons and inhibit AgRP/NPY neurons•POMC/CART neurons inhibit lateral hypothalamus (LH) using the transmitter -melanocyte stimulating hormone-MSHArcuate Neural Circuitry and Appetite(I)(Long-term appetite control)12AgRP/NPY neuron (appetite)POMC/CART neuron (appetite)Arcuate NucleusLHPVN+GhrelinLH appetite stimulating functionNPYArcuate Neural Circuitry and Appetite(II)PVN appetite inhibiting functionAgRP-AgRP blocks actions of -MSHGhrelin released by stomach when empty, stimulates AgRP/NPY neurons that do 2 things:•Inhibits PVN cells using the transmitter NPY •Release AgRPin LH, and this blocks-MSH inhibition (acts as an antagonist on these receptors), leading to increased LH activity(Short term appetite increaseduring fasting)13AgRP/NPY neuron (appetite)POMC/CART neuron (appetite)Arcuate NucleusLHPVNLH appetite stimulating functionArcuate Neural Circuitry and Appetite(III)PVN appetite inhibiting functionPYY & GLP1 released from intestines in response to meal •PYYinhibits AgRP/NPY neurons, which disinhibits (i.e.; increases) PVN activity •GLP 1 stimulates POMC/CART neurons, which inhibits LH activity(Short term appetite decreaseafter meal)+GLP1-PYY14Bypassing the Hypothalamic Feeding CircuitArcuate nucleus circuitry can be bypassed by food-associated cues•Rats given food + cue that predicts foods delivery•Present cues in sated rats, they eat more (Pavlovian conditioned feeding), but…•Lesions to prefrontal cortex or amygdala, or disconnection of theamygdala-LH pathway abolishes conditionedincreases in feeding•NOTE: NORMALfeeding patterns unaffectedby these lesions. •These lesions only disrupt cue-induced feedingPrefrontal cortexamygdalaLHThese regions are activated by cues associated with feedingIncreased appetite/feedingAmygdala-LH disconnectionFeeding induced by cue++15Neurochemistry of Hunger and SatietySerotonin (5-HT): a major brain satiety signal•5-HT agonists or releasers (e.g. Prozac) in humans and animals can:-Increased 5-HT activity shifts food preference awayfrom fatty foods-5-HT acts as short term satiety signals associated with meal consumptionBrain regions: 5-HT inhibits release of NPY in the PVNof hypothalamus, which then disinhibits PVN neurons to promote satietyfeeding, even with cafeteria dietsamount of food consumed per meal but notnumber of meals per day","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
