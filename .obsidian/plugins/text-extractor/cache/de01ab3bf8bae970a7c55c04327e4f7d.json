What are you being asked to believe? 2. What evidence is being given as support for this belief? 3. Are you being given all the evidence for and against this belief? 4. Is there more than one way to interpret the evidence for this belief? What are alternatives? 5. What additional evidence would help to evaluate these alternatives? 6. What conclusions are most reasonable? 13 What makes theories good? Supported by data Falsifiable Parsimonious 14 What makes theories good ▪ Falsifiability is ability for one to show a theory to be wrong ▫ There can exist data that are inconsistent with a theory Theory A True False TRUTH/REALITY EVIDENCE NEEDED 151617 Falsifiability Greater video game violence causes increased expressed aggression If true… Greater video game violence causes greater expressed aggression If false… Greater video game violence lowers OR doesn’t change expressed aggression Greater video game violence is related to expressed aggression If true… Greater video game violence associated with increase OR decrease in expressed aggression If false… Greater video game violence is not related to expressed aggression TRUTH/REALITY SEEK EVIDENCETHEORY/CLAIM Correlational/ Non-experimental Experimental 18 Falsifiability ▪ Falsifiability can also be considered as a matter of degree ▪ Flip a coin 10 times ▪ Make 4 predictions of the coin when it first lands ▪ Which prediction is unfalsifiable? 1. More heads than tails 2. Heads every time, until someone looks, then “?” 3. H T T T H T H H T H 4. Heads ≠ Tails 19 Falsifiability ▪ Which prediction is the most falsifiable? 1. More heads than tails 2. 3. H T T T H T H H T H 4. Heads ≠ Tails 20 Falsifiability ▪ Which prediction is less falsifiable? 1. More heads than tails 2. 3. 4. Heads ≠ Tails 21 Good vs. Bad ▪ Make predictions that exposes themselves to falsification ▪ Make specific predictions = Strong support ▪ Make predictions that are difficult to falsify ▪ Make general predictions = weak support Good Hypotheses Bad Hypotheses","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
