Where’s the rush!Step 1: train rats to administer drug (cues can be presented with drug infusion)Step 2: Take rat thru extinction (lever press no longer delivers drug or cues, rats stop responding)Step 3: On test day, lever pressing still PROVIDESNO DRUG, but, reinstatement of lever pressing can be induced by…•A drug prime –or-•A stressor (eg; footshock) –or-•Drug-associated cuesSo, a drug “taste”, cues associated with drug, or stress can1)Increase accumbens DA release and 2)Trigger drug-seeking behaviour•Blocking DA transmission REDUCES all types of reinstatement of drug-seeking7Dopamine and Addiction? Putting It All Together•1) Addictive drugs dramatically increase mesolimbic DA levels–DA does not appear to mediate the hedonic effects of natural/drug rewards (liking), but plays a major role in associative learning and preparatory/approach behaviours (ie: wanting)•2) Drug-induced increases in DA “trick” your brain into thinking something important is going on, so it starts to make associations with environmental cues/actions linked with drug-taking•3) Reward-associated cues increase DA release in regions like the accumbens–This DA release can trigger the same behaviours that got you the rewards in the first place (drug-seeking)•4) Prolonged drug use leads a hyperactive (sensitized) DA system–Increased DA transmission can amplify the effects that drug-related cues exert over behaviour8Dopamine and addiction-an aberrant form of learning•Incentive-Sensitization Hypothesis:cues associated with drug taking take over behaviour –Initial drug taking driven by pleasurable effects–Over time, tolerance develops to hedonic effects (likingthe drug less), however, effects on the dopamine system and the learning about drug-related cues become sensitized–Drug-related cues (external, contextual, internal, temporal, or stress) activate neural networks (including dopamine system) that trigger unconscious conditioned responses that may be viewed as craving•These conditioned responses make you THINK you WANT the drug•Similar to how food-related cues can make you hungry–The associative memories between the effects of the drug and associated cues become amplified by the hyperdopaminergic state. •Essentially the brain is hijacked by the DA system. Drug cues trigger more craving and then more drug taking, even if the effects of the drug are not as pleasurable","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
