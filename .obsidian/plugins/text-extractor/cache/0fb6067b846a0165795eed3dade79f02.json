Rise Run Y-intercept ▫ Regression line: ■ �𝑌𝑌 = 𝑎𝑎 + 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 ■ b = slope ● Rise over run ■ a = y-intercept ● When predictor = 0, what is the value of the criterion? ■ �𝑌𝑌 = 7.03 − .04𝑏𝑏 Relationship “Point of origin” 9 Cultural adaptation ▪ Most important benefit of regression: ▫ Can investigate role of multiple predictors in independently predicting the criterion Age of Immigration Years in Canada Height Canadian identification 10 Cultural adaptation ▪ To examine contribution of each predictor, we use the multiple regression equation ▫ �𝑌𝑌 = 𝑎𝑎 + 𝑏𝑏1𝑏𝑏1+ 𝑏𝑏2𝑏𝑏2+ 𝑏𝑏3𝑏𝑏3 �𝑌𝑌 = 6.90 − .04 age of immigration + .01 years in Canada + .02 height ▪ Multiple correlation coefficient (R) R = .49 1112 Cultural adaptation ▪ To examine contribution of each predictor, we use the multiple regression equation ▫ �𝑌𝑌 = 𝑎𝑎 + 𝑏𝑏1𝑏𝑏1+ 𝑏𝑏2𝑏𝑏2+ 𝑏𝑏3𝑏𝑏3 �𝑌𝑌 = 6.90 − .04 age of immigration + .01 years in Canada + .02 height ▪ Multiple correlation coefficient (R) R = .49 R2 = .24 13 Partial correlation ▪ 3rd variable problem ▫ Some other variable is responsible for the relationship between X & Y ▪ Identify and statistically control for 3rd variable! 14 Example of partial correlations Access to health care, clean drinking water… Number of Cars on the Road Life Expectancy Life Expectancy Number of Cars on the Road “SOCIETIES IN WHICH PEOPLE LIVE THE LONGEST HAVE THE MOST CARS! CARS IMPROVE LIFE EXPECTANCY! ” REMOVE THE EFFECTS OF… 15 Measures of relationship ▪ Bivariate correlation (r) ▫ Standardized index of how much two variables change with each other ▪ Squared Correlation (r2) ▫ Proportion of variability shared by 2 variables ▪ Multiple Regression ▫ A technique used when we want to test how well one or more predictors individually predict the criterion ▪ Multiple Correlation (R) ▫ A type of correlation coefficient that indexes how much a set of predictors, when combined, is related to the criterion ▪ Squared Multiple Correlation (R2) ▫ Proportion of variability in criterion accounted for by set of predictors ▪ Partial Correlation ▫ A correlation between X and Y that statistically removes the effect of 3rd variable 16 Any questions? 17","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
