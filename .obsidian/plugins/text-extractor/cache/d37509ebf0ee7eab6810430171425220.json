For further information on Polity , visit our website: www.politybooks.com Preface Unlike many second editions, this book is substantially rewritten. I rewrote it to emphasize two things. First, I emphasize here much more than I did in the earlier edition Chomsky's view that the science of language should be – and in the case of his work, is – a natural science. He does not study language in the way the socioli nguist, almost every philosophe r, and most psychologists and computational modelers do – as language in use, a form of human behavior . He instead uses the methods of the natural scientist, and treats language as a biological ‘ or gan’, a biophysical system in the human head (and human head alone) that like any other biologically based or gan grows and develops automatically , given appropriate input. Second, I emphasize the nature of natural science methods, and explain why and how language is best studied scientifically by respectin g the goals of these methods. Because of this, a much larger part of this version than of the last deals with what philosophers call “epistemology ,” and specifically , to a branch of this form of study found in the philosophy of science. And new to this edition, I add a glossary of some of the technical terms in Chomsky's linguistics. It appears at the end of the main text. As in the earlier edition, though, I continue to emphasize the difference between the kind of unders tanding of the world afforded us by commonsense understanding and that of fered by natural science. Chomsky's political work is found in the co mmonsense domain, his study of language in the scientific . And again as in the earlier edition, I suggest a way in which these two aspects of his work can be related. I am grateful to many for discussion, criticism, and insight, but particularly to Prof. Chomsky himself. I have enjoyed many interchanges with him and benefitted greatly from discussion, including that which appears in print in a volume called The Science of Language , hereafter designated as C&M. I am also very grateful for critical com ments and suggestions from readers for Polity , for the patience and encouragement of Polity's Senior Commissioning Editor , Emma Hutchinson, and for the careful and clarifying attention to the text by my copy editor , Fiona Sewell. Finally , I thank the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for invaluable financial support used in the preparation and writing of this work. Errors in the text that remain are entirely my responsibility . In tro ductio n This book is an introduction to Chomsky's work in linguistics, p olitics, and the philo sophies of mind and language. I have tried to make the material in it accessible to anyone willing to read carefully and think about the text. But it will require attention and thought. There are several reasons for this. Because Choms ky's work questions generally received assumpti ons about the n ature of lan guage, the understanding of the human mind, the status of social or ganizations and their justification, the sciences of language and mind, limitation s on the human mind, the nature of biological evolution, the status of science and its form of understanding, and the concept of human nature and its n eeds, no one should expect that understanding Chomsky's views will be easy. Further, it is no t enough in an introduction to Chomsky's work just to outline his views on topics like these. In order to actually understand what he is up to, you must also understand why he adopts the views that he doe s. That requires investigating his basic assumptions and why he maintains them – what justification they have, if any . He has tried in various ways to help his reading audiences do this. Perhaps the most successful of those ways is found in his contrast between what he calls the “rationalist” approach to the study of mind and the “empiricist” one. That contrast is explained in detail in the text. He places his work as a scientist in the rationalist camp and, ironically , points out that the empiricists are not empirical scient ists in their attempts to understand the mind, while the rationalists are. I will explain why and, like Chomsky , will make historical references to figures in both the rationalist (especially René Descartes) and empiricist traditions. But judging by the reactions and decisions even of many of those who claim to of fer sciences of language and min d, it can be difficult to abandon the empiricist view . It is for many the default approach. Complicating matters still further, Chomsky's science of language and the methods he adopts for construct ing it have dominant roles in his thought – even, I suggest, in what he has to say about human nature and politics. So it is impor tant to come to understa nd what that science and metho d are and – perhaps even more important – to understand what kind of science and method they are. For Chomsky , and very much unlike the majority of those who try to study language, the science of language is a natural science like physics or chemistry, differing not in methods, but only in subject matter. So we must take a close look at his view of science, and the science of language and mind in particular . Doing that is an exercise in a branch of what ph ilosophers call “epistemo logy ,” the study of knowledg e and belief and their justifications. In partic ular, it requires a close look at Chomsky's philosophy of science. After outlining Chomsky's accomplishments in chapter 1 , I turn to that topic. Some might find discussion of the nature of science and of scientific knowledge remote from their everyday concerns. And it is – but there is an impo rtant lesson in that that needs emphasis. If you do not unde rstand Chomsky's views on scientific method, you cannot understand the nature of his science of language, or hoped-for science of human n ature. Nor can you und erstand the ways in which a natural science of the mind could play a role in constituting and justifying a political ideal. There is another reason for focusing from the start on Chomsky's views on science, and on the sciences of mind – including language – in particular . In recent years there has been a growing emphasis on what Chomsky and others call “biolinguistics.” Cho msky has from the beginnings of his study of language in the 1950s assumed that the study of language must somehow come to be coordinated with the study of biology . There are several reasons for this. One is that humans alone have language; many other creatures have communication systems, but not language. Unless language is a gift from a god, then, it must have appeare d in the human species as the result of an evolutionary change – likely a single mutation in a single humanoid who gained from language a capacity for complex and context-independent thought and transmitted this to progeny . Another reason for assuming this is that on the evidence, language is not learned, but develops automatically , which suggests that its development or growth is like that of an or gan in a biological or ganism. Still another reason for it is that the study of language, like the study o f another mental system, vision, meets the methodological standards of the natural sciences , not the social sciences. That suggests that language is a natural object, not some kind of socially constructed institution, and thus that its study can be coordinated with other natural sciences – biology , among othe rs. In fact, biology – especially in the form of what is called “evo-devo” (for evolution-development) – is the only science that can plausibly deal with a system that has evolved, that grows automatically as biological or gans do, and that is studied with the tools of natural science. In any case, while Chomsky has long assumed that the study of language must be coo rdinated with biology , it is only relatively recently that it has become possible to make progress in accomplishing this and beginning to address the q uestion of how language evolved. That is because of progress in the science of language. I will explain what biolinguistics is and attempt also to explain why ‘biologizing’ language is so important to Chomsky's attempts to construct a science of human nature. And I will attempt to outline Chomsky's Enlightenment projec t of coming to under stand humans as natural objects with language and an innate moral sense – central aspects of what can be called his “biological humanism.” I hope to make this challenging task an interesting one by trying to involve readers in Chomsky's intellectual challenges. A glossary of some technical terms of linguistics appears at the end of the main text. A brief biography Avram Noam Chomsky was born December 7, 1928 to Russian Jewish immigrant par ents William and Elsie Chomsky in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His informal education began with his mother's radical politics and his experience of the Depression, which included violent treatment by authorities of wo rkers. His education began at a Deweyite school run by Temple University , a school that emphasized creative self- development rather than instruction according to a set curriculum. He thrived in this environment, pro ducing at the age of ten an editorial for the school n ewspaper that discussed the fall of Barcelona during the Spanish Revolution and lamented the growth of fascism in Europe and elsewhere. The reading he did for that editorial and into his early teens proved sufficient many years later to allow him to write a trenchant and detailed review of a scholarly book on the Civil War. His teenage years were punctuated by train trips alone to New York where he spent time with a politically active uncle who ran a newsstand. Engaging with the leftist communities there gave Chomsky an opportunity to develop his political knowledge and views, complem enting his contributions to and activism in left Zion ist youth groups in Philadelphia. 1 These trips also give him the opportunity to visit used bookstores, helping satisfy his voracious appetite then and now for the intellectual stimulation of reading. His interest in political discussion and critique continued thereafter, although it did not come to be expressed in mainstream society until 1964 with his prominent role in protests against the Vietnam War. Chomsky's basic anarchosyndicalist political alignments have not changed during his life; they continue to inform his study of current affairs and guide his political critique. But they have come to be strengthened and given a deeper foundation in his view of human nature and his efforts to contribute to a science of human nature, in which the science of language has a crucial part. Chomsky's experience at a Philadelphia high school was considerably less satisfying than his early grade school years: he discovered that he was supposed to be a “good student,” but rebelled against the demand for conformity to curriculum and obedience that this was thought to demand. His expe rience at the University of Pennsylvania – he began there at the age of 16 – was for the first two years disappointing; it was like his high school experience. It became very int eresting later, however: a few instructors challenged him, accepting him almost immediately as a junior scholar and treating him even in his under graduate years as a graduate student. It was at Penn that he discovered language with linguist Zellig Harris (who was also involved in left Zionist politics), developed the formal-mathematical tools of natural science with mathematician Nathan Fine, and evolved and refined an inter est in the philosophy o f science and its pursuit with philosopher Nelson Goodma n. Goodman (who a few years later moved to Harvard) helped arrange an appointment for Chomsky as a Harvard Junior Fellow , which proved to be very impo rtant in Chomsky's developin g career. It brought him into close associati on with important thinkers in various fields, and provided him the time an d opportunity to develop independently a massive work called The Logical Structur e of Lingui stic Theory (LSLT), a chapter of which was submitted as his PhD dissertation at Penn. Never published in full, the 900-plus page manuscript was during the 1950s distributed in microfilm and primitive paper copies, and it helped establish Chomsky among a few specialists as an individual who had developed a new formal and mathematical approach to the study of language. Chomsky was later given credit for helping to initiate what is now called the “cognitive revolution” – althou gh Chomsky himself insists that the real cognitive revolu tion took place in the seventeenth century with the work of Galileo and Descartes. LSLT was eventually published in part in the 1970s. Chomsky's first major published work was Syntactic Structur es (1957). It amounted largely to lecture notes for a class given at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) populated primarily by prospective physicists, mathematicians, and early proponents of something called “information theory .” They – and eventually many others – were intrigued by Chomsky's formal approach to natural language, an ap proach that eventually turne d the study of language into a progressing form of natural science. Some students became linguists themselves. Perhaps the work that most brought attention from a larger group including psychologists and philosophers, however , was his devastating 1959 review of behaviorist B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior . That, and his 1964 decision, when his career was already thriving, to again p articipate in political analysis and critique with his princip led rejection of the US invasion of Vietnam, broadened his audience eventually to a worldwide one. There was never a guarantee that Chomsky would become a linguist. His intellectual development depended to a significant extent on coming into contact with the right individuals, and even to some extent on historical accident: seeking a deferment from the military draft at the end of the 1940s, he applied for graduate work leading to a PhD. And in fact, even after Chomsky's experience at the University of Pennsylvania and some of the Harvard fellowship, he and his wife very nearly decided to return to Israel to live on a kibbutz (Chomsky 1987). The attractions of an intellectually challenging career and an opportunity to work out some of the consequences of his under graduate and Penn MA theses (The Morphophonemics of Modern Hebr ew) led to the decision to stay in the US, however . After the fellowship, he joined MIT, where he was engaged on a machine transla tion project – a project that for various reasons had little chance o f success. Syntactic Structur es , howev er, convinced MIT to in itiate a pr ogram in linguistics with Morris Halle and Noam Chomsky as faculty. The program soon attracted out standing students such as Robert Lees, and excellent young staff, including Jerrold Katz and Jerry Fodor . Along with Chomsky's work in linguistics, and aided by the massive amoun t of reading he did of historical figures in linguistics and philosophy during his fellowship and thereafter (and still), he began to develop a broader framework for the study of lang uage and mind (his rationalism), and began also to integrate his work on language with developing work in ethology , investigations of human nature, and studies of evolution and bio logy . While rarely recognized for the systematic and comprehensive philosopher that he is (perhaps especially among professional philosophers, whose mistakes he routinely expos es, deflating egos nurtured within what has become a specialty with mistaken assump tions), this work places him within a small group of individuals whose work has universal relevance and interest. Chomsky retired recently , but he continues his work in linguistics, politics, and philosophy . It is still very difficult to get to see him, and bookings for his lectures are still arranged years in advance. His wife and lifelong support Carol died in December 2008. He visibly aged thereafter, but remains intellectually vigo rous and firmly committed to working in linguistics, the study of mind, and political critique, continuing to travel worldwide to give talks in all these areas. He thinks of himself as just a “worker ,” however – an intellectual worker . And he strives to be a responsible one. For what that amounts to – it reveals a lot about the man – see the last chapter . No te 1 Left Zionists at the time were against the establishment of a Jewish state. 1 Cho msky's Co n tributio n s Chomsky's contributions and access to them Noam Chomsky works in several intellectually important areas and has made significant contributions to others, including some developing fields. Perhaps the most prominent areas in which he works are linguistics, political analysis and criticism, and the philosophies of language and mind. In this chapter , I will outline these contributions and describe how they have been received. At the end of the chapter , I will say something about the extent to which Chomsky's intel lectual contributions relate to one another – the extent to which his science of language relates to his pol itical views through his view of the human mind and human nature. The beginning Chronologically speaking, Chomsky's first contributions were to political and social analysis. At the age of ten, he wrote an essay on the Spanish Civil War and the spread of fascism, noting the role of the fall of Barcelona and Toledo in this regard. This and other early contributions were unrecognized except by a small group associated with his Deweyite grade school run by the Temple University in Philadelphia. The reading he did in preparation for this article in his grade school newspaper indicated his strong interest in politics. Conti nued reading in political affairs during his early teenage years sufficed to write many years later a sophisticated review of Gabriel Jackson's scholarly book on the Spanish Civil W ar. There is a lesson in Chomsky 's early intellectual achievement in the social/political domain. Perhaps surprisingly , it should not be seen as particularly unusual or remarkable. Any child of his age who focuses their interests in the way he did could do it – although very likely now , of course, with a different political issue. That is because everyone, including the fairly yo ung, has available the tools of folk psychology , which – when joined to a critical attitude supplemented by efforts to find out what actually happened rather than accepting what one is told happened by government of ficials or standard media sou rces – suffice to produce a sophisticated essay or discourse on this or o ther political matters. Other children have managed similar ‘feats’, although not often with the politics of a region of the wor ld and how it is affected by the economic and military imperial ambitions of powerful states. Many children can recite in detail the statistics for players on a football team and assess the chances of the team succeeding. Many others might read in detail and keep up on the exploits of various ‘celebrities’, engaging in sophisticated talk with others about their favorites. Still others can speak with authority on the benefits of various computers and computer games. In effect, other children like the young Chomsky have used the tools of folk psychology to develop remarkably sophisticated understandings of sports and of other domains of human interest and interaction. Someti mes they can assess as well as adults the prospects of a team or the foibles of their parents and other adults. Chomsky's accomplishments in his grade school and early teens relied on the same tools as did theirs: describing people's actions in specific domains and figuring out their interest s and motivations. Granted, the fact that Chomsky focus ed his interest on the actions of people in the political domain does not by itself suffice to explain his sophisticated review of Jackson's book. Clearly, in addition Chomsky had – and has – an extraordinarily good memory an d capacity to or ganize thoughts. He has a very well honed critical attitude. And he describes himself as a “fanatic” in his efforts to gather information. In his teenage years, he would take trips alone to used bookstores in New York to find materials to read. He continues to read massive amounts of material in various fields. Some of these factors make him unusual, but a basic point remains: all people have the intellectual capacity needed to understand, assess, and make decisions in the political and social do mains. There is no need for specialized knowledge of the sort needed in the advanced mathematical-formal sciences such as chemistry, physics, or the mathematical linguistics that Chomsky first developed. This difference – and the explanation for the differences in accessibility and ‘expertise’ in the sciences as opposed to politi cs and other areas of human concern – is one of Chomsky's central themes. I return to it several times, and especially in the fourth chapter . The natural science of language Widespread reco gnition of Chomsky's intellectual contribution s came first with his efforts to construct a na tural science of the human lang uage – that is, with his first efforts to create linguistics as a formal natural science. He began his work in linguistics while still an under graduate at the University of Pennsylvania . There he wrote The Morphophonemics of Modern Hebr ew and submitted it as his under graduate thesis in 1949. That document was revised and became his Master's thesis at Penn in 1951; it was eventually published (1951 /1979). His PhD thesis in linguistics consisted in a chapter of a massive work he wrote while a Junior Fellow at Harvard. That work, The Logical Structur e of Lingui stic Theory (LSLT), was thinly distributed, largely ignored, and not published – and then only in part – until 1975. The first of his monograph-length works to be published was Syntactic Structur es (19 57), which was essentiall y a workbook for a course in linguistics as he understood it at MIT, a course attende d by MIT under graduates – primarily mathematicians and engineers. Considerably later, Chomsky 's courses came to attract professional mathematicians, physicists, philo sophers, and some psychologists interested in Chomsky's formal approach to constructing theories of a mental system. Syntactic Structur es and LSLT made groundbrea king proposals and helped develop an approach to the study of language and the mind unique for its time in the 1950s, and still in a minority position with those who do computer model ing of mental capacities, philosophy of mind and language, psychology , and even linguistic s. Linguistics as understood in the US for the first half of the twentieth century was dominated by a procedural form of structural linguistics accomp anied – often – by behaviorist assumptions concerning how to learn a lang uage and the belief that (perhaps phonetic features aside) languages could take any form whatsoever . The work of Bloomfield, Joos, and Chomsky 's instructor and advisor at the University of Pennsylvania, Zellig Harris, dominated the field. The basic aim was to make some assumptions abo ut what the ‘simples’ of language are (syllables, or perhaps phonemes) and, given this, find procedures for putting them tog ether to yield the, or a, ‘form’ for a language. Chomsky's work made it clear that this approach failed to make sense of the facts, that that kind of bottom-up procedure wo uld not yield the relevant units of language. Among the important units it could not deal with are the morphemes (irreducible parts of words) that a child must quickly come to recognize as the significant ones if he or she hopes to acquire a language in anything like the kind of time period actual children manage to acquire one – typically , with adult competence, and without regard to specific language or the child's n ative general intelligen ce, about three and a half or fo ur years. A morpheme is an abstract unit. Children – even infants – appear to be able to single them out. But that requires that they have available to them at a very early age some mental device that ‘sees’ the morphemes and other abstract units. To do this, Chomsky assumed, the child's mind must bring to experience a way of or ganizing it in order to yield the ‘right’ structure (or structures, for multilinguals) for the data received in the short time it takes the child's mind to acquire a language. The child's mind must bring to experience an innate notion o f what a natural language – including a sign language – must look like and some kind of way to ‘ select’ the language(s) spoken or signed in the p opulations in which a child develops. If so, the linguist's task consists in of fering a theory of what the child's mind brings to experienc e or input in order to acquire or learn lang uages under the conditions that children actually do. To o ffer this, the lin guist must postulate and construct a theory of what the child's mind begins with (the “initial state”; Chomsky called it “Universal Grammar” or UG), of how a specific language is acquired or grows, and of the possible final states that languages can assume. Chomsky held from the beginning and continues to hold that this daunting task requires using the methods of the natural scientist, not the social scientist. Natural scientists of fer formal, explicit theories of the phenomena of nature that postulate ‘hidden’ entities, events, and systems. We will find Chomsky's answers to how the child's mind manages to acquire a language under actual conditions in a later chapter; there came to be more than on e as his theories improved. The important point for present purposes is that any theory or science of language had better assume from the beginning that language is – like walking – a capacity that is innate in human beings, and apparently o ne of very few mental capaciti es available to no other creatures. And if language is innate and a mental system, another reasonable assumption is that the right place to look for language – that is, for the subject matter of a theory of language and of how a language develops or grows – is inside the head, not in communities of speakers or in linguistic actions and behaviors. These assumptions, that the methods of the reasonable ling uist depend on assuming innateness (nativism) and postulating what is inside the head that accounts for the relevant facts (internalism), were and still are characteristic of Chomsky's naturalistic approach to language. These same assumptions are, however , anathema to many others who would like to consider themselves scientists of the mind and language. This is especially true of behavioris ts and the many who were influenced by them, and of those who – like the behaviorists – assumed that languages are somehow lodged primarily outside the head (externalists) and/or are learned primarily as a result of training (anti-nativists). That is a large group: it includes the proceduralists, behaviorists, and – now – connectionists, plus the great majority of psychologists, philosophers, and computer modelers. To counter the externalists and anti-nativists, Chomsky pointed to their errors. That effort began with his devastating 1959 review of the behaviorist psychologist B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior , and continued thereafter in many articles and books (1975, 1980/2005, 2000, among others). More important, he also chose to undermine the assumptions of externalists and anti-nativists about how to proceed in constructing a science of the mind – that is, their methodology and its standards of success. Chomsky characterized those who share externalist and anti-nativist assumptions about ho w to proceed as “empiricists” and later (but amounting to the same thing) “ methodological dualists.” He also defended his own nativist and internalist assumptions, which he called the assumptions of a “rationalist,” later “methodological monist,” and most recently , “biolinguist.” His defense consisted of – among other things – pointing out not only that the rationalist approach made the best sense of elementary observations concerning language and its use, but that sciences of the mind and language based on rationalist assumptions made far greater progress by the standards of the natural sciences than any based on empiricist ones. This suggests that rationalist methodologies and assumptions are more empirically based than are empiricist ones. If correct, the result appears ironic: empir icists in the study of mind, and language in particular , are not empirical scientists, where rationalists are. One might wonder why so many reject an internalist and nativist strategy for the scientific study of lang uage. One plausible answer is that these assumptions conflict with the commonsense conception o f language. According to that conception, languages are learned from parents and others; they are human inventions, created to provide for effective communication. These views conflict with a nativist methodology . Again according to common sense, lan guages are basically social institutions, the property of communities, thus external to any particular mind, making an internalist strategy appear wrong-headed. There are other factors too, but perhaps the commonsense view is the most important. Because readers are likely to be influenced by this commonsense view too , I devote considerable parts of chapters 2 through 5 to explaining why Chomsky's science of language is nativist and internalist, and why these methodological assumptions also work with other components o f the mind. And I return very briefly to Chomsky's rationalist/empiricist distinction and the justification for a rationalist approach after sketching his contributions in p olitical analysis and criticism and his work in the philosophies of language and mind. Political analysis and criticism The seco nd major area to which Chomsky has contributed – an d surely the best known in terms of the number of people in his audience and the ease of understanding what he writes and says – is his work in so ciopolitical analysis, political, social, and economic history , and critical assessment of current political circumstance. In Chomsky's view, while those in power might – and do – try to obscure their intentions and defend their actions in ways that make them acceptable to citizens, it is easy for anyone who is willing to be critical and consider the facts to discern what they are up to. In an interview with Bill Moye rs on PBS several years ago , Chomsky remarked that all one needs for understanding political and social affairs in general is what he calls “Cartesian common sense.” For Chomsky , this involves the capacity he and other normal persons have available to them to employ the natively available tools built into common sense, and particularly thos e of folk psychology . As suggested before, that capacity , plus a critical attitude sensitive to the influence of self-intere st and self- deception on oneself and on oth ers – especially in analyzing political and economic structures and the actions of those who are in positions of power – is what is nee ded. And it is this capacity that Chomsky asks his readers and listeners to exercise, so that – given the facts to the extent that they are available – they can make up their own minds. A co nsiderable part of Chomsky 's work in this area consists in correcting of ficial histories which portray the actions of imperial powers such as the US now and Britain in the nin eteenth century as the acts of beneficent powers with moral aims. The actions of imperial states include efforts to use military and economic power to colonize and control economies and political decisio ns in foreign states, hardly honorable acts. To make them appear to be justified, however , these uses of power are presented to the citizens of the imperial powe r as efforts to ‘civilize’, ‘im prove’, and otherwise bring what citizens consider benefits (recently democracy and freedom, and in nineteenth-century Britain, Christianity) to the populations of those they control or attempt to control. Prominent examples of Chomsky's work in this regard appear in his many discussions of Vietnam (where, he argues, the US won after all in its overall strategy of preventing the spre ad of indigenous economic and social development), of US efforts to turn the Philippines into a colony , of nineteenth-century British efforts to do the same in India (and, of course, Africa), of US efforts ever since the Monroe Doctrine to control politics and economies throughout South and Central America, and – perhap s most discussed of all – of various US involvements in the Middle East and the Palestinian–Israeli conflicts. The title of his massive 1983 book The Fateful Triangle suggests his views: virtually from the beginning, the US's involvement in the Palestinian–Israeli conflict has been one of serving the US's interests. As he points out in several plac es (e.g., 1996), his primary aim in all his political work is to reach people who are in a position to act as moral agents and can do something about the atrocities that the exercise of imperial ambitions always produces, such as the hundreds of thousands of civilians killed in the ‘sur gical’ US invasion of Iraq, preceded by the Bill Clinton- induced embargo of medicine and other needs, an embargo that led to hundreds of thousands of other deaths, predominantly of the young. These facts are hidden from US citizens by compliant corporate-run media that serve the interests of the elite. In effect, Chomsky tries to reach the citizens of democracies who can vote imperial governments out of power and replace them with more morally responsible ones. That is one of the reasons he gives for fo cusing predom inantly on the US: he aims to reach the citizens of the o ne country that still dominates the world in economic and military matters and yet can still be controlled by its citizens. Despite unending and in recent years increasingly successful ef forts to influence and control the vote on the parts of corporations and the economic elite that benefit from these imperial actions, the US still affords its citizens the right to or gan ize and to vote. Resisting the efforts of corporate-run media, government spin personnel, and corporate influence on legislatures is, however , a daunting task. Certainly many in the US read Chomsky's books of political analysis and criticism. And he can count on getting audiences for his talks, often ranging into the thousands. Further, he is not alone: others, such as the late Howa rd Zinn, have played important roles in attempting to correct of ficial history , critically assess current political and economic polici es, and encourage individuals to or ganize to take control of governments that are now largely under the control of corporate and economic elite power . Chomsky and those who work with him have had little direct effect in the US, however , no doubt due in part to corporate control of media, of government, and – judging by decisions that give corporations almost unlimited control of political advertising – of the US Supreme Court. Despite this, Chomsky emphas izes, there is at least some reason for optimism. It is not that there have been no advances due to the work of progressively minded individuals and or ganizations. During the last century and a half there have been real improvements in coming to recognize slavery as simply immoral, in recognizing and entrenching in law women's rights, in forcing governments to justify invasions, and in other ways that would now be difficult for those in power to reverse. And currently there are groups seeking to right the wrongs of massive inequalitie s in wealth distribution and ensure greater benefits to the “99 percent,” although so far, with little success. These extreme inequalities began to develop in the 1970s in the US with its unilateral rescinding of the Bretton Woods financial contro l agreements, followed in succeeding years by the steady diminution of the financial regulations that had been established in order to prevent a repeat of the recession of the 1930s. The story is a long one, throughout suggesting that the US government in the last 40 or so years is a one-party system (the Business Party, with ever-increasing dominance by the financial sector), with two slightly different variants. Some aspects of it are taken up in the chapters on Chomsky's political work. In general, progress in reversing policies that benefit the elite is slow and difficult. In current relatively democratic but capitalist soc ioeconomic systems, at least 80 percent of the populations of these nations have no control at all o ver economic decisions. That is given to increasingly diminishing num bers of ‘managers’ – at the top, to the wealthy elite, and corporations, which have as a result massive powers that are well entrenched in the political, economic, and ideological structures of these capitalist-plutocratic economies. Earlier in Britain and now in the US, the elite and corporations have for decades enjoyed the benefits o f a nation's imperial ambitio ns. In the US, and especially after World War II, economic and military power has led to virtual control of the economies and social policies of several foreign states. These are among the reasons that change that actually brings about improvement is difficult. It is possible, but requires the work and cooperation of a large number of people who are or ganized and are aware of the problems and who have in mind a view of an alternative economic and so cial system that distributes wealth in a far more eq uitable way, giving everyone a degree of power in economic decision-making. Some might p oint out that there is a swifter way: violent revolution. That is an option, but it is a very dangerous one. Chomsky rejects it (1981b) except as a last resort. It is very hard to justify, and history has show n that on the whole the changes brought about too ofte n eliminate the good in an existing system while rarely bringing real benefits to those who need them the most. As ment ioned, attempts to bring about political and economic reform in a democracy depend on the willing cooperation of a large prop ortion of a population, and cooperation is possible only if linguistic, social, political, and economic knowledge are within the cognitive capacities of anyone. But that is available: everyone has Cartesian common sense. No doubt some acquaintance with statistical significance and with justifiable assessments of risk can help someone to develop a clear and reasonably balanced view of political and social circumstance s and options, and knowledge of these can help peo ple make more reliable decisions. But these can be developed in individuals, or provided by responsible intellectuals who have not been co- opted by power (1988b, 1989). Often, sensitivity to how easy it is to make mistakes and bad decisions – on e aspect of a critical attitude – is all that is needed to come up with good descriptions of social and political situations and good decisions about how to plan and to act in them to suit one's needs and interests along with those o f one's community . Discussion with others helps to o, of course. But all of this is within the range of capacities for anyone. There is no need for fo rmal training in arcane theories with their novel and difficult-to-master concepts such as biology's ALLELE or physics's MUON. In essence, any person willing to pay attention and to use their natively available concep ts such as PERSON and MOTIVE in a critical way can understand an d assess social and political matters and decide what to do about them. No acquaintance with a science (that is, a natural science) is needed. That is fortunate, since no such science is available, and in the domain of human action and thought, Cho msky holds, it is not likely that any will ever develop. In the domain of action and thought concerning action, we are more likely to get insight from literature than from science. W e return to that in a later chapter . What, however , about what is called “political science,” and “political theory?” The issue needs more discussion than I can give it in this brief summary of Chomsky's intellect ual contributions, but I can hint at his view. One aspect of his view of political science, and more generally the social sciences, is revealed in his remark to the effect that if there is any deep insight o r profound understandi ng revealed in the work of those who call themselves political scientists, economists, and the like, he is unaware of it. What one gets from the political scientist is, at best, a careful and reasonably objective systematized account consisting of a description of a social o r political circumstance that illuminates perhaps-neglected factors in, say, the relationship of economic systems to politics. But like any such description, goo d or bad, it employs or assumes commonsense assumptions built into folk psychology . These are concepts that we all use in thinking about an d describing people and their actions, interests, purposes, projects, desires, decisio ns, and the like. And these concepts appear to be ineradicable: efforts to construct natural sciences of human behavior have for good reasons failed, and if you must use these commonsense concepts to describe behavior and to attempt to make predictions about what people will do, your efforts depend essentially on what you and (you think) others might do in similar circumstances. You never escape the standpoint of an agent and the guesses about needs to fulfill and beliefs about what is the case. At worst, what one gets is an attempt to justify current power structures and the privileged position of the political scientist or social scientist in it. But in no case does one get a natural science. Another aspect of Chomsky's view appears in his attitude towards what he calls “anarchosyndicalism” or “libertarian socialism.” These terms represent a strand of sociopoliti cal and economic thought with which he is willing to say he aligns himself. He does not claim that these are theories that can be prec isely and formally characterized. They represent instead the outlines of a po litical ideal that he believes – or better, hopes – suit the fundamental nee ds of human nature. He rejects the idea that the political- social-economic ideal that they label is one that can be fixed to a specific structure or tied to particular socioeconomic circumstance. He does, of course, think that there is some justification for maintaining at least some conception of the ideal. It lies in some observations (see, e.g., “Language and Freedom” in 1987) and reasonable guesses about what humans are (what human nature is) and what fundamental needs they have, given their natures. In essence, he suggests that anarchosyndicalism/libertarian socialism provides an outline of how best to or ganize a political-economic system in order to meet the fundamental needs of humans. But the observations an d reasonable guesses that underlie his reasons for saying which human needs are fundamental do not constitute a scien ce, and his view of fundamental human needs (freedom/liberty and community/association under conditions of freedom) is not based on a science that is in place, one that can yield predictions and can reasonably be expected to establish connections to other sciences. Perhaps that is why he often speaks of hopes, not probabilities: he hopes, for example, that people who are not in p ositions of power , who are not influenced by propaganda, and who are decent would – at least in industrialized socioeconomic conditions where many tasks can be carried out by machinery – come to choose by virtue of needs built into human nature to create and live cooperatively in some form of socioeconomic structure that approximates the ideals of ana rchosyndicalism and libertarian socialism. There are other factors that lead to speaking of hopes rather than probabilities too, of course. Chomsk y is well aware of the abusive use of power and the desire of those in positions of power to maintain their positions, the threat of nuclear or environmental disaster, and the influence of religious faith, including the influence of various state religions with their intellectual priests. Chomsky's writing and speaking techniques when dealing with political, social, and economic matters reveal still another aspect of his view of the status of political theory . As suggested before, his political wor ks are often attempts to “recover history ,” as Irene Gendzier (2005) says, to remind people of basic moral principles such as applying the same standards to your ow n action s as you apply to others, and to invite those in his audiences to exercise their native capacity to understand and criticize the decisions and actions (thus motivations) of people and governments. His efforts at encouraging people to use their own resources are reflected in – among other things – his use of irony . Irony requires that when someone says something, you recognize that what they say cannot be taken at face value, since you know that the truth lies elsewhere. For example, in his discussions of US politicians speaking of an invasion of a country as a way of bring ing freedom to the population, it is clear to the critical reader from the cont ext that the ‘freedom’ to be brought to the foreign population is the freedom of corporations to move in and control the economy – and typically , with the aid of the US government, to control the government – to the benefit of the corporations, not the population. Similar poin ts arise with regard to ‘free trade’. In effect, all his political and social writing and speaking techniques ask people not to listen to him or others tell them what to do or how to think, but to assess and decide for themselves by using their native powers, critically applied, not abrogating their responsibilities and allowing those in positions of power and influence to decide for them. In sum, if there is anything challenging in Chomsky's political work, it lies not in dif ficulties in understanding what he writes and says. It lies rather in the demands his writings and speeches impose on readers and listeners to accept responsibility for their own thought and action. One can , of course, come to different conclusions and decisions than Chomsky does. I suspect, though, that that can be difficult if one actually tries to take into account the histories and current data that he presents, and is not persuaded otherwise by faith or self-interest. In this vein, Chomsky says (C&M: 1 14–17; see also 1996) that he deliberately avoids trying to talk to his audience or to persuade anyone of the correctness of his position. That is because persuasion is the use – or rather, abuse – o f power . It appe ars in salesmanship: the aim of the seller is to co nvince someone of someth ing by relying on their fears or desires, and being very selective in the ‘ev idence’ of fered. It is often the way of the ‘good speaker ,’ someone who manages to convince an audience of something, typic ally with the purpose of serving the speaker's interests, not the audience's. It is the way of force, not the way of discussion among those who agree on basic principles, speaking as one human to another with common concerns. As Chomsky put it (1996), he tries to speak with his audiences, which is the aim of the good teacher . Philosophy of language and mind The third area is Chomsky's work in the philosophies of mind and language and the philosophy of science, particularly as it bears on the science of mind and the science of human nature. Some of Chomsky's writing takes the form of exposition of his views of mind (or mind/brain) and of language, supplemented by criticism of the views of professional philosophers and of many in what is called “cognitive science.” There is no surprise in the criticism of cognitive scientists and of cognitive science as it is of ten practiced, despite the fact that Chomsky , along with a few others, is given credit for having initiated “the cognitive revolution.” Chomsky's views of the mind and of langu age and the methods by which they can be studied differ quite radically from those of mainstream philosophers of mind an d language, and from those of many psychologists, workers in artificial intelligence (AI), and linguists too. Often, readers will find that at least initially , they side with those who disagree with Chomsky . There may be an explanation of that in an opposition between the empiricist's and the rationalist's views of the human mind and how to study it. The empiricist view can be thought of as the default view, default because it is closer to the commonsen se view of language (what it is, how it is learned, and where it came from) , the human mind, an d human action, and o f how to study language, mind, and action. They do not challenge the commonsense view that language is a social institution, created by humans (“to communicate,” it is said), and transmitted to the young by training. Because they do not – and unlike Chomsky's naturalistic science of language – their view of the mind and how to study it is not at all difficult to understand. But their approach is wrong-headed. I explain why in detail in later chapters. Here, I'll just point to the errors of failing to abandon the commonsense concept of language and refusing to study language and other mental systems as the natural scientist does. The poin t is general: commonsense concepts do not serve the interests of the n atural scientist, only the interests of agents and their “lived world,” as some philosophers call it. A glance at the history of the advanced mathematical-formal sciences indicates that while scientific fields such as physics might in their very early years have relied briefly on commonsense versions of concepts such as FORCE or BODY, these co mmonsense concepts proved to be very poor guides to constructing objective sciences of various domains. The concept of FORCE in contemporary physics has nothing to do with the commonsense notion, where force involves effort on the p art of an agent to – typically – move something, and where action at a distance such as that found in gravitation is incomprehensible. Because common sense maintains a grip on intuitions, many criticized Isaac Newton for intro ducing action at a distance, which from their commonse nse point of view was occult . But they were wrong. In a similar vein, the co mmonsense concept BODY has long been abandoned entirely in physics, despite the strong grip it continued to maintain on early physicists such as Descartes, Galileo, and even Newton. Parallel points apply in the na tural science of language: sentences as understood in Chomsky's theorie s of language are not a series of marks on a page, a cluster of word-sounds issuing from someone's mouth, o r a group of signs. They are not commonsense sentences. They are rather “e xpressions” (a technical term) that consist of a group of lexical items in a specific structure that breaks down into phrases, and phrases in turn consist in groups of lexical items (the technical substitute for words) that themselves consist in a package of semantic (meaning-related) and phonological (sound-related) information. Despite the commonsense view of language, sentences, phras es, and lexical items are all in the head, and are neither seen nor heard. And sentences and phrases are products of derivational or computational procedures that evolved and so are innate; the procedures provide for an in-principle infin ity of structured groups of lexical items – Chomsky's ‘sentences’. The theory of all these things must meet standard conditions on naturalistic theories and must – among other things – say how these ‘things’ came to be in the human species, and the human species alone. No doubt people will continue to speak of sentences and words as understood in the commonsens e way, and will speak of parents teaching language to their children just as they continue to speak of forcing a peg into a hole, or thinking of the human being as made up of a mind and a body . But while what some phil osophers call “grandma's view” of language will per sist, for it serves some action-related purposes, it does not follow that the scientist need pay attention to it – except to discourage others from trying to take it seriously in constructing a science of language. It is relevant to these points that Chomsky describes his own contribution to cont emporary cognitive science as more a reintrodu ction of a seventeenth-century cognitive revolution than a matter of inventing something really new . Consider what some seventeenth-century philosopher -scientists such as Galileo and Descartes and their followers accomplished. No doubt they initiated the study of physics as we know it as a mathematical-formal science. But, more important, they invented the methodology that we now take to be characteristic of natural science, not just of physics but chemistry, biology , and – if Chomsky is right – linguistics. Specifically , they in vented, or at the least helped characterize, the natu re of a phy sical (natu ralistic) theory by explicitly stating and following in their practice the aims of natural scientists in constructing such theories. It is important to emphasize that their conception of a natural science was quite different from that suggested by the differently oriented methods of science their near -contempora ry Francis Bacon emphasize d. Bacon's methods are very much like those of John Stuart Mill; they are the methods of careful data-gathering and evidence, and they say little abou t the nature of a theory and what it should accomplish. The ‘laws’ of Bacon are compilations of data – generalizations of observations. They say nothing about the role of simplicity in theory-construction (and the expectation of simplicity in nature, as with Galileo and Descartes with his “light of nature”). There is no recognition of the role of postulation – the theoretical introduction of unobservable entities – and thus no recogniti on that the world o f a natural science coul d be and likely is very different from the “lived world” of everyday exp erience. Nor in a correlative way is there understanding o f the fact that the things described by a theory need not be observable in any interesting sense at all, for they are products of the theory . Bacon's observational generalizations and induction are useful in theory- confirmation an d justification. But they do not yield natural science theories. The methodological requirements on theory-construction – drawn from Galileo's practi ce and writings, and from René Descartes's essay on scientific method (1637) – express what a theory of natural phenomena should accomplish. They emphasize descriptive (not ob servational) adequacy: a theory must provid e complete and correct descriptive terms to deal with the theoretical entities introduced by the theory and their possible states and processes. They must also of fer explanatory adequacy – which includes saying why some obse rved phenomena arise at all. Further, they must aim at simplicity (difficult to define, perhaps taking several forms, and yet readily recognized) and at objectivity (including allowing no anthropocentric considerations such as interest or function to play a role in the theory and its terms). And go od theories must be formally an d explicitly stated (to ensure that all those who participate in the science in question know what a theoretical term means, and what it might refer to in the world, if the theory is successful) plus of fer accommodation to other sciences (perhaps more basic ones). I go over these norms of natural science in more detail later. There is one more consideration, one that Descartes left o ut of his methodological desiderata in his misguided belief that the contact mechanics he invented said all that needed to be said by way of description and explanation of natural phen omena, from the workings of the cosmos to neural signaling . He should have recognized that his work would be superseded by a better theory , and that while his theory might have made progress over some earlier attempts, it was very likely that another would come along that would make further progress in one or more of the considerations mentioned above . Good theories make progress; superseded versions come to be abandoned, or used only in restricted cases. Sciences (theories) change, although the requirements on good sciences do not. Nevertheless, assuming one has at a time a theory that manages all this and has no rivals that are better by the relevant standards than it now is, one can until a better theory comes along (where ‘better ’ is judged by appeal to the standards of natural science ) say that one's theory is true and correctly describes and explains its domain. These standards, plus the role of Chomsky's distinction between the rationalist and the empiricist approaches to the study of mind in applying the standards of natural science to the study of mind, are also taken up in the next chapter . The unity of Chomsky's work? Particularly given the rather sharp divide between careful methods and precise concepts found in the advanced mathematical sciences and theories and those employed in commonsense, practical problem-solving of the sort where commonsense concepts and a powerful combinatorial system due to language effectively invite flexible use, figurative language and metaphor , and what Chom sky calls “ordinary creativity,” it might appear that there is little chance that Chomsky's work in the science of language would have any relationship to his work in the moral-practical domain of politics and social affairs. And for most peo ple, including scientists, it is qu ite true that there is no connection: it is difficult to conceive of a connecti on between the study of phy sics or or ganic chemistry and specific political views. But I suspect that assuming that there is no connection in Chomsky's case would be a mistake, even though Chomsky himself does not encourage attempts to link his work in the natural science of language to his work in politics, economics, and social affairs. He points out that there is no way to deduce anything about his work in politics or attempts to capture ‘the good life’ from his work in language. Or at least, as he mentioned in passing during a speech entitled “Government of the Future” in New York in 1970, it is “not yet” po ssible. At most now , he says, there is a connection that is “principled, but it's weak.” In an interview with him in 2004 (C&M: ch. 25) he responded to my question con cerning a connection by saying: “there's no deductive conne ction. You could take any view on either of these topics, and it wouldn't be inconsistent to hold them … There's some point at which a commitment to human freedom enters into both. But you can't do much with that in itself.” And he is of course right: there is not much you can do with this in itself. But it is possible to do something. Specifically , you can, I think, point out that the evolutionary introduction of langu age gave human beings a specific cognitive capacity – essentially , the capacity for recursion or of putting together an unbounded number of sentences, and thus the largely unconstrained capacity to produce a discrete infinity of distinct cognitive perspectives (along with elementary mathematics) – that underwrite s all the cognitive advantages that humans have that other intelligent primates lack. With language we can and do disengage our thoughts from current circumstances and plan, speculate, wonder … on en dless topics in endless ways. Coupled with speech or sign, this cog nitive capacity allows us along with others to coordina te and plan together , create and establish in stitutions, assign and agree to p lay specific roles, develop industries, create economies, invent and play games, tell stories, create traditions and histories, create and establish cultures, and so on. This is not to say that other animals that lack this capacity are mere automata, as Descartes seems to have thought. Neither Descartes's failed contact mechanics nor any existing science can completely predict the actions even of insects, much less of complex or ganisms such as fish and apes. But howev er ‘intelligent’ they might be, and however un predictable their actions are, they do lack a capacity that underwrites the extraordinary degree of freedom, creativity, and autonomy that human beings have, something that they have primar ily through the evolutionary introduction of language. I say “primarily ,” for there is good reason to think that some other aspects of the human mind are unique to us, and at least in part, independent of language. Clearly science-formation is unique to us, although this capacity is arguably connected to lang uage, to at least a degree. Connected to language in a different way, but probably evolutionarily indepe ndent of it, we have a stoc k of commonsense concepts and a capacity to readily develop more that demonstrably no other creature has. And per haps in part reliant o n langua ge, but again in dependent of it, we seem to have available a kin d of moral sense (Mikhail 201 1) that no other creature has. No doubt further study of what is distinctive to human nature will turn up other factors unique to us and our mental capacities – perhaps music, perhaps something like an aesthetic sense. Nevertheless, it is still possible to speculate with some degree of confidence, and claim that language is the primary factor in making us unique. Assumin g this, and continuing to speculate, the science of language as developed by Chomsky shou ld be a prime contributor to developing a natural science o f human nature. Perhaps it was realization of this fact that led Cho msky to remark “not yet” in his 1970 speech. For if we had a completed science of human nature in hand, and if lan guage played a central role in that science, and if it turned out that language was what of fered to humans both the degree of freedom and creativity we have and the oppo rtunity to coordinate and to plan and build together , it might be possible to establish a tighter relationship between the science of language and politics. Something like this picture of the relationship of language and politics seems to have been at play in a speech-then-paper of Cho msky's that appeared in 1970, “Language and Freedom” (in Chomsky 1987). In it, Chomsky outlines how the freedom and creativity of fered us by language might pl ay a role in coming to understand what the good life is and, through that, what an ideal form of social or ganization or political system would best lead to the good life. The good life – following to a degree some ideas of Marx here – is seen as one that satisfies fundamental human needs. Among those fundamental need s are the need for freedom and creativity. Also among the fundamental needs are those of solidarity , love, friendship, etc.: call these needs for co mmunity , or at least, community under conditions of freedom (for no one fundamental need should be satisfied without also satisfying the other). Focusing on these two, and assuming as a background con dition adequate industrial-economic means to ensure not just survival but the leisure that is needed to fully develop and satisfy the needs for freedom along with those for community , Chomsky suggests that a version of ana rchosyndicalism or libertarian socialism (a set of principles that respects both the need for freedom or autonomy and the need for community and solidarity with others) best of fers a way to create and institute a social and economic o rder that maximally meets these needs. He assumes that human nature, given provision for survival and thriving, would conver ge on such a social system – if, at least, one could ensure that the institutions created did not (as do capitalist forms of democracy and government-controlled socialist systems) of fer ways in which individuals could entrench themselves in position of power . I return to this speculation in the chapters on Chomsky's political work. I return also to the issue of how to understand a science of human nature, and along with that, how to conceive of evolution. Chomsky's view of evolution is different – being different on a central issue should be no surprise by now – from that of many mainstream thinkers, and especially different from several evolutionary psychologists such as Steven Pinker (with Bloom , 1990). 2 The Min d an d Its Scien ces Introduction An imp ortant key to understanding Chomsky's views of language and politics is found in his views of the human mind, of how to study it, and what it does or does not do. As I mentioned, he sees the human mind and its study in a way that is very different from the way that very many in the various fields of cognitive science such as psychology (including neural psychology), AI, linguistics, and philosophy do. Unlike many of these others, though, he takes the trouble to explain why he treats the mind and its study in the way he does. This chapter discusses and begins to explain his reasons. The issues for the scientist of mind and the strategies Chomsky has tried several ways to clearly present to general audiences the issues that he confronts in his studies of language and mind. Perhaps the one he uses the most lists what he sees as the four primary issues that anyone who wan ts to construct a science of language or of other parts of the mind must confr ont. He focuses on language, for obvious reaso ns. I list his issues for the study of language here (cf. 1988a) and add parallel questions for vision: 1 1. What is (knowledge of) language? / What is vision? 2. Ho w is (knowl edge of) language acquired (also known as “P lato's problem”)? / How is vision acquired? 3. How is (knowledge of) language used (one aspect of which is also known as “Descartes's problem”)? / How is vision used? 4. How is (knowledge of) language embodied in the mind/brain? / How is vision embodied in the human brain? In his most recent work, he might add: 5. How was language/vision introduced into the human species? While answers to the other questions are much the same for both language and vision, you should expect different answers for this last question. V ision is not unique to humans, while language is. As the issues for language are stated here (with ‘knowled ge of ’ in parentheses), there is a problem with generalizing beyond language to vision and other mental systems. While in everyday usage we English speakers say that we know a language (or languages), few would accept usage such as “know vision” or “knowledge of vision,” “know touch,” and so o n, even though vision and touch are mental systems in the way language is, and can be studied by relying on the same basic methodological assumptions and using the same tools of naturalistic research. In part, this difficulty is an artifact of English terminology; in some lan guages, one says not “know a language,” but “have language” or “have a language.” And then the parallel goes through: “have vision” is a bit odd, but acceptable. Perhaps if English were such a language, philosophers might not fuss as they do about the use of ‘know’ in connection with language. Perhaps none would complain as they do, “Su rely I must be able to justify what I know , but you tell me I can't even say what I know!” or “But if I can't say what I know , then knowledge of language must be a form of know-how , rather than kno w-that!” But Chomsky does not take the easy way out, and simply declare that their fussing is due to an artifact of English. He confronts the philosophers at length, in part – no doubt – to confront the mistakes that they make in un derstanding what he is up to and to display and undermine the misguided assumptions on which they proceed, assumptio ns that are shared with many psychologists, workers in AI, and others. He also, though, wants to preserve som e aspects of the idea that we know a language; amon g other things, he says that language is a “knowledge system.” I touch on that later; fo r the moment, we can assume that the kinds of questions posed here apply across the board. But how does one address these issues? I suggested earlier that it does no good to come up with the answers to these questions you get by relying on the commonsen se conception of language and mind. To the issue of how language is acquired, for examp le, you get the answer: by being taught it by parents and others in one's community . When puzzled by the question of what kn owledge of language consists in, you're likely to come up with the dominant philo sophers' answer that it's a kind of skill or know-how: speaking well or truthfully (correctly according to the ‘linguistic community’) in various circumstances. These answers were particularly popular during the second half of the twentieth century , and they remain firmly in place in the assumptions of many today . The problem with answers like these, though, is that they ignore elementary facts concerning learning languag e and its use. Because they do, they of fer no real hope for a science of language, a naturalistic theory of language in particular . Before continui ng, I emphasize that I am not denying that there are language skills: reading and public speech are two, and in their cases, training and practice can indee d help. But you have to have a language before you can do either , and getting one is not learning a skill. Given the progress Chomsky's efforts have made, it is quite possible now to defend his na turalistic approach to language by pointing to its success and to the fact that it speaks to facts that those who simply assume that their commonsense version of language can serve the purposes of science cannot address. I'll expand on that later. But it is also possible to defend it by showing that it alone actually speaks to the elementary facts I mentioned above, and does so by adopting and following the well-developed methods of the natural sciences that have proven so successful in chemistry, physics, and the like. To take that more strenuous but more revealing route, I will outline what that methodology is, what it assumes, and how Chomsky uses it to speak to elementary facts about language acquisition and use. Concerning the fourth issue mentioned above – how is language embodied in the mind/brain? – I need to point out that it is Chomsky's view that for language this is an issue that is not yet addressed, and o ne that will likely take a lon g time to address. Given the enthusiastic pron ouncements of various neural psychologists and connectionists, you might think that a science of language should begin at the neural level, and build on this as a foundation. But as Chomsky often points out (e.g., 1988a), unless you have a scienc e of language in place, you don't even know what to loo k for at the neural or neural network level. So you should think of the theory that he of fers as providing at an abstract level an account of some events and operations of the mind/brain. His theories are “computational” theories: they int roduce theoretical terms that describe the possible ‘inputs’ to a linguistic computation/derivation, the combinatory principles that assemble groups of lexical items togethe r and yield expressions, and the possible outputs of the system/computations. This is also a form that theories of vision such as David Marr's (1982) and his followers of fer. The theories are entirely internal ist, meaning by that that they restrict themselves to some or ganized operations in the mind/brain, without including in the theory's subject matter anything that goes on outside the head – if anything – that might have prompted a specific computation/operation at a time. And they presuppose that the systems in question are biophysically based; they are innate. There is a difference between theories of language and vision. With respect to “low- level” vision and a bit beyond, there has been so me success in mapp ing the computational theory onto neural systems. But beyond brain scans that point to several areas of the brain involved in language, and a great deal of sp eculation, there is no such success with the science of language. Mapping is a genuine issue for the science of language, not an empty one; it is not merely a mystery. But it is an issue for the future, not the present with its primitive understanding of the brain and its operations. As Chomsky suggests (1995a, 2000), the situation is a bit like the relationship between chemistry and physics at the end of the 19 20s. It was physics that needed to chang e before it could be accom modated to chemistry. For the physics, prior to its significant modification at the end of the 1 920s and early 1930s (with Linus Pauling's work), could not – among other things – deal with the matter of chemical bonding. In the language case, the compu tational theory of language is well ahead of what is actually known about the brain. N aturalistic methodology and the study of mind Chomsky calls himself a “rat ionalist” and contrasts rationa lism as he understands it with what he calls “empiricism.” These terms have a historical resonance and Chomsky's ways of understanding them can be justified by appeal to the assumptions of several historical individuals who have been classified as one or the other . But Chomsky gives these terms, like other semi-technical terms or terms of art, a specific use or application. It is important to say what that is, because rationalism as Chomsky understands it seems to of fer the only plausible strategy or methodology- with-assumptions for constructing sciences of language and the mind. Rationalism and its opposite, empiricism, are – as Chomsky understands them – methodo logical recommendations on how to proceed to construct sciences of the mind's parts. Rationalism and empiricism adopt distinctive metho dological assumptions concerning studies of the mind. Rationalism adopts the methods of the n atural sciences; these apply across the board to any subject matter, inside or outside the head. Rationalism supplements these methods by recommending that the scientist of mind adopt a nativist and internalist approach to their subject matters, whether language, vision, facial configuration, or whatever they may be. Empiricism recommends rather that the would-be scientist of mind adopt an externalist and anti-nativist focus. In doing so, Chomsky argues, the empiricist cannot make sense of some elementary facts about language acquisition and use; the empiricist risks, then, failing to of fer a (natural) science of mind at all. In effect, empiricists end up recommending a form of what Chomsky calls “methodological dualism.” They recommend – or better, simply adopt – a strategy that fails to make sense of elementary facts that rationalism takes seriously . As a result, empiricism in the study of language and mind fails to be empirical. Let us see why . N atural science Working from the most general to the more specific, I'll start by outlining how to understa nd the term “na tural science” in terms of a methodology , not a subject matter. One of the unfortunate results of Descartes's insistence on separ ating mind from body , making them out to be different substances, is that it seemed to demand that the mind be studied in a different way than body . The distin ction itself proved to be hopeless when – some fifty years after Descartes – the concept of body that Descartes worked with turned out to be hopeless. It became hopeless when Newton's inverse squ are law for gravitation showed that there is action at a distance. As a result, the concept of body turned out to be just as mysterious from the point of view of common sense as mind. Nevertheless, Descartes had anothe r reason to distinguish body and mind, one that is perfectly compatible with naturalistic methodology . I explain below . An early review of Chomsky's first book-length publication (Syntactic Structur es ) by Lees in 1957 noted that one of the book's major contribution s to the study of language was Chomsky's insistence on using the mathematical-formal tools of natural scientific investigation in coming to understand what a language is. The point is a significant one, in part because most of those who study language – including many who would like to call themselves scientists – still do not use the methodol ogical tools of natur al scient ific research. That is due in part to a reluctance to accept that lang uage is a biologically and physically (and chemically, etc.) based system that grows automatically , given appropriate input – that it is innate. Failing to recognize this, these individuals remove the study of language from nature, placing it in the realm of social construct, or human creation. I return to that. Keep in mind that if you want to define or capture the notion of natural science at all, you had better think of it in terms of a method, not a subject matter. The subject matters of biology and physics are different, but good theories in each discipline – good by the standards of natu ral science research – are natural sciences. You cannot appeal to everyday usage to define n atural science: a remarkable number of things have been called natural sciences, from astrology to phrenology , and even behaviorist accounts of mind. And you sho uld distinguish natural science from social science: the latter deals with human action and behavior , and that is beyond the reach of natural science and its methods, for several reasons taken up below . The history of science helps clarify how to characterize natural science, for the beginnin gs of natural science as we understand it are found in the methodological recommendations of Galileo and Descartes. Perhaps Galileo's greatest contribution was to insist on simplicity in his experiments and a form of idealization: mathematization of the results in for mally stated laws. He did not try to tackle very complicated problems, such as trying to find out how trees grow or how to convert lead into gold. These issues were well out of the reach of the scientific resources of the day. Rather, he ran simple experiments and thought experiments and abstracted away from actual results in order to – among other things – conceive o f how balls would roll down inclined planes if there were no air or friction to interfere. 2 He did so in ord er to ferret out the various contributing factors to – among other things – gravitationally accelerated motion. The simplicity and idealization he sought – although it is hard to define, and takes various forms, including Occam's razor – is nevertheless readily recognized by anyone familiar with a form of naturalistic inquiry . Some illustrations appear in later chapters in the discussion of Chomsky's work on language. Descartes in his Discourse on the Method expressed the need for simplicity and idealization in a way that is a little different from Galileo's; he compressed it into one of his four methodological rules for research, in the form of breaking problems and phenomena down into their simples and constructing formal mathematical models of the behaviors of items under varying conditions. His rules are useful for another reason too. When expanded (with distortions such as those induced by Descartes's foundationalist assumptions eliminated), Descartes's rules go beyond Galileo's recommendations and come close to what we now take the methods of natural science research to be. Even in expanded and cleaned up form, though, Descartes's rules are not complete, in part for a reason that he did not appreciate. One crucial rule he did not include is that scientific investigation int o a domain must make demonstrable progress. Perhaps the reason he did not recognize or accept this principle – now a commonplace of scientific research – is that he rather foolishly believed that the contact mechanics he proposed answe red all the relevant questions, so that no further progress needed to be, or could be, made. Newton's inverse square law of gravitation some fifty years later showed how very wrong Descartes was: not all action requires cont act. But while incomplete, Descartes's rules were a significan t contribution. I will not dissect his rules here (for that, see my 2013). Instead, I of fer a mo re up-to-date way of characterizing natural science method. I suggest that a natural science for a domain must lead to the construction of a theory or series of theories that over time makes progress in one or more of the fo llowing seven ways. First, it/they must be descriptively adequate (compare Chomsky 1965). This does not mean merely that a theory is observationally adequate, where observational adequacy is a matter of conforming to some set of observations concerning the observable phenomena of a theory – perhap s, in the case of language, grammaticality. Rather, meeting descriptive adeq uacy is a matter of describing, in the terms of the theory , the ‘hidden’ elements and processes that the theory postulates, the elements and processes that can – among other things – make sense of what is observed. Since virtually every advanced natural science postulates hidden entities and processes, and since these are what a theory describes, it should be obvious that observation, however careful, bears on descriptive adequacy only by providing some evidence in favor of the postulated theory . Among other things, you cannot observe theoretical entities, unless – fo r example – you stretch the term ‘observe’ to allow that observations of cloud chamber photographs displaying certain lines and squiggles are observations of a muon as it decays. It is not: it is an observat ion of lines and squi ggles that, given a theory a nd its pr edictions , of fers some evidence in favor of or against the theory . Second, a theory must be explanatorily adequate . Explanatory adequacy could be unders tood as including several of the methodological constraints on a good theory listed below , such as accommodation with another science, but it is better, I think, to reserve the term “explanatory adequacy” for a narrower consideration: explaining or making sense of puzzles posed by some observational generalizations relevant to the domain under investigation, pl us broader issues such as why language is the way it is – in effect, how it evolved. In the case of Chomsky's science of lan guage from the 1950s to the present, for example, the facts revealed by what are called the “ poverty of the stimulus” ob servations (discussed below) dominated the explanatory agenda. In essenc e, a theory of language must be able to explain how infants and children acquire language quickly and in a regulated way even though they do not receive instruction, and have access to limited data. There are o bservations of language use that need explanation too, the creative aspect of language use ones. They did not dominate discussion in the way the poverty ones did, though – and they are often still ignored. Strictly speaking, it will turn out, they cannot be explained by science as we und erstand it; they are likely a mystery.3 But a good theory can help make sen se of them, and clarify why they cannot be explained – predicted or otherwise entailed – by a theory . Third, a theory must be formally , explicitly stated . Theories that in troduce vague and ambiguous terms cannot count as theories at all, and mathematical-formal models must often abstract from actual observed results. One must try to produce theories with theoretical terms and laws that provide for ways to focus on the relevant factors as p recisely as possible and conceive of them in abstraction from interfering factors using as precis e a formal system as can be produced, given the state of research in the field. Fourth, a theory must be simple . As mentioned, this is difficult to define, but easy for those familiar with r esear ch in a field to recognize; alternative terms focusing on different aspects of simplicity include “elegant,” “minimizing” (as in Chomsky's post-1990s Minimalist Program), “beautiful,” “austere,” “ef ficient,” and the like. Fifth, a natura listic theory must be objective , where seeking objectivity amounts to something like aiming to ‘carve nature at its joints’ without allowing personal, anthropocentric, and perspectival factors to enter . Sixth, a theory must aim towards universality in any domain where the conditions for the existence of the phenome na under investigation arise. A theory of language, for example, must be one that applies to all human beings, and that can describe all relevant theory-introduced phenomena for all human beings, including a specification of the conditions (e.g., specific genetic factors) under which the theory fails to apply . This is sometimes called stating the “boundary conditions” on the theory . And seventh, a theory must be one that can be accommodated to other scientific theories in related domains. In the case of language, since it is a system that appears to be one that grows in acco rd with a biological (and physical/chemical/computational …) agenda, the science to which it must dominantly accommodate is biology . That is because language appear s to be unique to the human species, and so must have evolved. And if it evolved, it must be manifested in individuals primarily because of something unique to the human genome. The other factors that constrain growth into a normal individual – com putational, physical, chemical, etc. constraints – are always in place for relevant kinds of processes. Adding now to the seven listed above the demand that a science make pr ogr ess over time in on e or more of the seven ways already listed, we can say that there are eight methodological demands on the const ruction of a natural science theory . When they are met, one can say that the theory is true, at least until further progress is made. And we can also define a natural science as one that meets the conditions stated. In effect, a go od (natural) science should be one that has a theory or theories that meet the conditions stated, and any form of study that consistently fails to meet one or more of the cond itions, or that for som e reason due to the nature of the subject matter cannot meet one or more of them, is not a naturalistic theory . The emp hasis is on constructing an ideally good theory as hoped for in, for example, the effort to produc e a complete physics. As mentioned earlier, some prefer to trace the orig ins of science to near -contemporaries of Descartes and Galileo, such as Francis Bacon, or even earlier, to Roger Bacon, perhaps even Aristotle. But Francis Bacon's principles (and those of the o thers) focus on making good observations and providing o bservational generalizations by making sure that one is choosing fair sample sets, comparing only genuinely like cases, and so on. They are useful for gathering information (such as the poverty of the stimulus observations taken up below) and for providing evidence for a theory . But the crucial considerations in constructing a natural science are not found in these principles, but focus rather on constructing a good mathematical-formal theory – usually postulatin g unobservables, as with Chomsky's ‘expressions’ an d ‘lexical items’ – that meets the eight demands. The Bacons – and more recent indi viduals such as John Stuart Mill – do not really touch on these matters. A mom ent's thought about the eight conditions suggests the important point that only forms of study that focus on the relatively stable and predictable properties and processes of nature in isolated conditions can meet these eight. The demand for objectivity , as mentioned, could not be met if the phenomena were changeable and depended on the choices and perspectives of individuals and multiple contextual factors that cannot be fully spe cified and isolated. Experimentation and testing wou ld not yield the same results under the same conditions, assuming it is possible (as it should be, if the theory satisfies relevant constraints) to state what counts as the same conditions, and under what conditions the theory can be expected to fail in its predictions. There are, for example, conditions under which salt (NaCl) will not dissolve in water (H2 O), and they can be stated. Failure to dissolve under any of these co nditions does not challenge the theory; in fact, it helps increase confidence in it. Contrast cases like this with attempts to explain human behavior , a task that is usually understood as producing a causal theory of behavior that fo r external and/or internal circumstances C, the theory predicts behavior B. Unfortunately for this project, the behavior of a person as a whole – at least so far as the existing natural sciences of the mind/brain are concerned, and perhaps for all possible such sciences – would have to involve variable contributions from many internal systems plus attention to internal and external contextual factors that cannot even be adequately spec ified, not to mention isolated. Humans are not brains in vats, isolated from their environments. That is why there is no such theory , and very likely cannot be. In contrast, the ‘behavior ’ of som e isolatable ‘parts’ of the human, includi ng mental modules or faculties, can be predicted, given theory-specified inputs. That is because it is possible to construct natura l sciences of internal systems that allow for simplification and isolation from interfering factors. Systems so conceived are called “modules.” Notice that it follows from the above that there will be some domains in addition to human behavior that – even though ‘natural’ dom ains – will likely be out of reach of anything like the idealized form of natural science I have sketched. The climate, for example, is likely to be too complex, with few if any even of its componen t contributing factors (hydrocarbons, ocean temperature …) suf ficiently isolable from others to expect that it or they can be conceived of as a key ‘core’ structure or process to which the methodology can be fully applied. To avoi d confusion, I mention another view of a causal account of behavior , althou gh not a natural science one. It reverts to a commonsense picture o f the mind and its contributions to a person's action/behavior . It assumes that the relevant factors in an explanation of behavior are the usual ones in accounts of what is often called “rational causation.” The factors are beliefs, desires, understandings, etc. There is no serious prospect of making these out to be ‘entities’ in a natural science: it is not at all clear even how to begin . And there is little pros pect even of taking them ‘as is’ and trying to make them elements in an objective social science that makes predictions about what anyone with such-and-such beliefs and desires will do, given circumstances. No doubt I – and probably others – do think about what a person might want and believe in some circumstances, and make ‘educated guesses’ about what he or she will choose to do. And I can usually give reasons why I think so – probably quite good ones, if I know the person well. But that is no naturalistic theory . It fails at universality , formal statement, explanatory adequacy , descriptive adequacy , objectivity , accommodation, and simplicity . Yet there can be at least some n atural sciences of the mind – sciences of hidden entities and processes that take place in the human mind. We know there can be because there ar e such theories. At least with regard to vision, most would agree. And they would be right: vision has the right characteristics to be the subject of naturalistic theory . It is innate and, under conditions of normal development, the growing child gets normal vision, which includes a few acknowledged possible variants such as degrees of color blindness and variation in what a person will judge as a pure green (no blue or yellow) allowed for . Yet – despite many who refuse to accept the fact – language (or at least its core computational system) also has these characteristics.4 Quite apart from the success of Chomsky's and his colleagues' wor k, which could only succeed if language has these characteristics, there are independent reasons to assume that language also ‘grows’ (under specifiable conditions) to yield a stable (apart from vocabulary chan ge) “I-language” (individual language). Those reasons are found in the poverty of the stimulus observations as they apply to language. And there is another set of obser vations, the creative aspect of language use ones, that also bear on what o ne must assume about language and other parts of the mind: you must assume that they are modules that can best be studied by focusing on internal operations alone. R ationalism vs. empiricism: the strategy for the naturalistic study of mind We can begin a discussion of rationalism and empiricism by saying what, for Chomsky , they – and especially rationalism – are not . Consider Descartes, who m Chomsky along with many others classifies as a rationalist. But when Chomsky calls himself a rationalist and titles a 1966 book Cartesian Linguistics , he is definitely not committing himself to many of Descartes's views. Descartes seems to have believed that reason is a unitary system of the mind, and also the single system that accounts for the fact that we humans have minds that differ from the minds of animals. Chomsky's rationalism is not committed to any of this. For Chomsky , if there is anything that distinguishes the minds of humans from those of (say) the higher apes, it is not reason, but language, for language is on his view a natural o rgan of the mind and of fers the means for us to think an d reason, at least in the com monsense doma in. Language allows us to detach ourselves from current circumstances and think: we can speculate and wonder , think about the future and construct scenarios that include or exclude ourselves, and so on, because we have language. And while language allows us to think in the distinctive ways we do, the language system itself does not think, but peopl e think when they use language and the other systems with which language interacts, including vision, audition, imagination, and so on. Reason is not a system of the mind at all; it is rather a way o f describing what people sometimes do when we use language and related systems. Descartes also seems to have believed that humans have something like clear an d direct access to their own minds and its operations. Chomsky disagrees: we must construct theories (sciences) of the operations of the mind, which are otherwise hidden from view. We are sometimes aware of what we think, decide, or deliberate; but conscious experience of these is not always present, and when it is, it is a latecomer on the scene. For example, there is evidence that decisions are made in the mind before anyone is aware of making them. Further, Descartes seems to have thought that access to one's own mind is somehow privileged: no one else can – even in principle – gain access to it. Practically speaking, that might be true, at least to a degree. But the fact remains that there are (so certainly can be) objective sciences of parts of the mind, including an objective science of the language system. And finally , Descartes seems to have believed that science could not investigate the mind at all (although he is not entirely clear on this matter; for discussion, see part III of my introduction to the third edition of Cartesian Linguistics (2009)) . But again, we do have natural sciences of the mind. Now for the p overty of the stimulus (POS) and creative aspect of language use (CALU) observ ations and what they have to do with rationalism and empiricism. The POS observations apply to all mental systems that can be thought to develop or grow , and more gener ally, to – as we would now put it – all biolog ically based systems such as bodily or gans that develop in accord with a genetic, epigenetic, chemical, and informational ‘a genda’ that leads after growth or development to a normal system in an or ganism. The human heart and lungs, and if Chomsky is right, language and vision too are such systems. The other set, the CALU observations, apply in the first instance to language, although they might well apply – per haps to a reduced extent – to other mental or gans too. That is, they apply , so long as one conceives of a mental or gan such as vision as it is put to use by a human being or other or ganism. I'll explain that below . The POS and CALU observations support a rationalist approach to the natural science of mind. As noted, the term “rationalism” has a semi- technical status. It has some historical warrant, for it reflects some characteristic features of the work of Descartes, Ralph Cudworth, and some others often labeled “rationalists .” It is disputed, as any labels for historical periods and movements can be.5 But we can ignore the disputes. For Chomsky , “rationalism” is a label for a naturalistic research methodology for the scientific study of mind that assumes nativism and foc uses on the natures and operations of systems in the mind/brain (internalism). The POS observations apply , as mentioned, to all biophysically based or ganic systems that grow or develop into a more or less stable final state. These in clude hearts, lungs, vision, and language. Most discussions of POS facts have focused on mental systems, and particularly and recently they have foc used almost exclusively on language. There were at one time some who tho ught that children must learn to see things and to hear sounds, that these capacities do not automatically develop, given appropriate kinds of input at relevant stages of their development. But given the facts of development and the lack of evidence that anything like recourse to a generalized learning procedure such as hypothesis-formation and -testing or behaviorist train ing takes place, there is little reason now to take such views seriously . For while these systems need ‘input’ of some sort at various stages of development or growth, their final state is determined primarily by the n ature of the growing system's genetically based internal instruction set or agend a. A system's total final state – or more accurately, the possible form or forms that a mental system such as vision or hearing can take – is fixed by specific biological plus general physical, chemical, computational, etc. constraints on developmen t, not by specific things heard, seen. Of course, some input of a relevant sort is required to initiate development (‘triggering’), and to ‘shape’ the resultant system within a ‘window of opportunity’. For example, for a cat's visual system to detect horizontal gratings at all, the system must receive horizontal grating inp ut within a system-specific time period. The basic point remains, though: a developmental instruction set determines which kinds of input are relevant for initiating or shaping, what counts as a window of opport unity , what kinds of forms a mental system can assume, and what a specific system can ‘do’ – what it can contribute to an or ganism's cognitive capacity . The same is true, Chomsky holds, for the different apparent structures of different languages. He holds that language differences are innately specified, where “innate” takes into account biological (genomic) and other (non-genomic) constraints on growth. The ‘choice’ between differences is automatic: it is fixed by develop mental constraints and relevant inputs, not by deliberation and conscious decision. He also holds that the concepts expressed in everyday speech , such as PERSON and WALK, along with the range of possible word-s ounds in all languages, are innate, or fixed by a biophysical growth procedure (C&M: 42–5). POS observations clearly suggest this: children acquire the capacity to recognize the sounds of their mother -tongue-to-be within ho urs of birth (Mehler et al. 1978; Gervain and Mehler 201 1), and they develop many of the conc epts that come to be expressed in their natural langua ges in their infancy , before they can expres s them (Hirsh-Pasek and Golinkof f 1996; Woodward 200 8). It would be difficult to make sense of the selection an d apparent uniform ity in growth rate in all infants of these concepts without assuming that in order to explai n how they develop or grow , they must be somehow ‘antic ipated’ in growth systems, or in other words, innate. No training or learning as a result of training has taken place, and the concepts are too rich yet uniform to be acquired by some kind of associational mechanism. Nevertheless, this is a point that needs more discussion; I return to it in chapter 6 . At the moment, most of the discussion of POS observations and their implications foc uses on the structure of languages – what is usually called their syntax – rather than on specific concepts or sounds expressed in an individual's own ‘dialect’ or – the technical term – their “I-language.” There is a reason for this, although it is a bit ironic, given its nature. The reason is that since Chomsky and his co lleagues have constructed good theories of the o verall structure of language s, and because this structure is very clearly not taught (no child is instructe d in the syntax of language, at most in the ‘correct’ way to deal with irregularities), it is reasonably clear even to those who oppose Chomsky's rationa list approach what the syntax of specific languages is, reasonably clear what a child (or a child's mind) must acquire in order to acquire a language and know it, and thus also reasonably clear what to look for in the way of a generalized learning method that can learn the structure in question withou t committing itself to any but very general biological constraints ( Elman 2005), with nothing specific to language. To take a simple and much-discussed case, notice that children who have acquired enough language to understand a sentence with two or more is es in it has no difficulty forming and understanding questions made from any such declarative form. Thus, no child who has acquired enough to understand “The dog that is under the table is licking its nose” would ever form a question that took the first is in the sentence and fronted it, rather than the is from the main or matrix clause. You never find a child saying “Is the dog under the table is lickin g its nose?” only “Is the dog that is (that's) under the table licking its nose? ” No child is actually instructed in the rule for ques tion-formation for sentences like these: no parent or othe r child tells little Jane that she should always front the is fro m the main or matrix clause, never some other is , or (as in this case) the first is . And in fact, no child ever makes such an error , or easily understands a question that embodies the error , such as “Is the dog under the table is licking its nose?” This and many other such facts suggest to Chomsky that it would be wise to assume that the rule for formin g a question from the relevant indicative sentence must in some way be innate, or ‘anticipated’ in the machinery of development. But his opponents, while facts like these might be enough to make them give up the idea that a child is dir ectly instructed in syntax – for there is no evidence of that at all – nevert heless look for some generalized learning mechanism that can somehow extract the rule from observation of (presumably) cases where the child's mind observes adults and other children say the right thing. 6 Some statistics-based algorithms and the like have been proposed by psychologists who call themselves “connectionists” (e.g., Jeff Elman), and these algorithms – it is claimed – can manage the feat. Training computer programs to produce sufficiently ‘correct’ outputs, given sp ecific inputs, has convinced some of these experimenters that they are o n the right track and can do without the nativist's assumpt ion that the child's mind looks for structures of relevant kinds. However , there is no evidence that any such algorith m manages even after massive training to yield virtually perfect performance in accord with this rule by the time a child's mind manages to acquire the rule, especially when it is taken into account that that same generalized learning mechanism 7 must also learn from multiple observations, and these alone, the many other language- specific structural rules the child's mind does, plus all the language-specific sounds, the commonsense co ncepts, and the relevant sound–concept associations fou nd in specific lexical items – all of which are needed in order to underst and and produce the sentence mentioned above and endless numbers of other sentences that obey the rule. Making matters even worse for the empiricist, a child's mind acquires all this at about the same time as any other child's mind acquiring the relevant language, for there is little difference between children in stages of development or in timing as they acquire any of the natural languages. On the face of it, then, it looks as though the child's mind must come to the task with a lot of language- specific knowledge (implicit knowledge) available already . The empiricist option looks like a desperate effort to maintain dogmatically held methodological assumptions about the study of mind. That harsh criticism has not, how ever, convinced many intelligent people to abandon the option. Chomsky's diagnosis is that ideology must be at work here, not rational thought. To quote from his preface to a 1967 reprint of his 1959 review of the arch empiricist Skinner: I had intended this review not specifically as a criticism of Skinner's speculations regarding language, but rather as a more general critique of behaviorist (I would now prefer to say “empiricist”) speculations as to the natu re of higher mental proc esses. My reason for discussing Skinner's book in such detail was that it was the most careful and thoro ughgoing presentation of such speculation, an evaluation that I feel is still accurate. Therefore, if the conclusions I attempted to substantiate in the review are correct, as I believe they are, then Skinner's work can be regarded as, in effect, a r eductio ad absur dum of behaviorist assumptions. My personal view is that it is a definite merit, not a defect, of Skinner's work that it can be used for this purpose, and it was for this reason that I tried to deal with it fairly exhaustively. I do not see how his proposals can be improved upon, aside from occ asional details and oversights, within the framework of the general assumptions that he accepts. I do not, in other words, see any way in which his proposals can be substantially improved within the general framework o f behaviorist or neobehaviorist, or more generally empiricist ideas that has dominated much of modern linguistics, psyc hology and philosophy . The conclusion that I hoped to establish in this review, by discussing these speculations in their most explicit and detailed form, was that the general point of view is largely mythology , and that its widespread acceptance is not the result of empirical support, persuasive reasoning, or the absence of a plausible alternative. (1967:142) Chomsky might now consider the work of some connectionists such as Elman and colleagues to be a more sophisticated version of “empiricist assumptions.” Since this work remains within the framework of externalist and anti-nativist assumptions that characterize empiricist thinking about the mind, and since it refuses to accept the assumption that biology must provide some developmental instructions specific to language, he would likely hold that this more recent work too constitutes a r eductio of the empiricist research strategy and an indication that they are on the wrong track if they want to be natural scientists of the mind. Explicitly , now , the following are some generalized forms of POS observations as they relate to language. To appreciate these generalizations and their correctness, you do n ot need acquaintance with the science of language, or any other science. They are generalizations that anyone who is willing to observe closely and employ the tools of common sense can manage. One generalization has to do with rate of acquisition: all children, without regard to language acquired, come to have adult mastery of the syntax of a language by the age of three and a half or four , and to develop this capacity by going through the same set of developmental stages: babbling, one-word constructions, two-word, three-word, and the rest, the introduction of grammatical elements (‘devoted’ syntactic elements and constructions), etc. Another points to the fact that virtual infants seem to be able to understa nd even fairly co mplex structured forms of language before they are able to produce it. A third is that there is no obvious evidence of training (or explicit “negative evidence”) in language acquisition and where one does find efforts to of fer it, the child's mind resists it (as with parents' efforts to ‘correc t’ the child with irregular verb constructions: the child says “I bringe d it with me” and when told to say “brought it” instead, the child, unmoved, continues to say “bringed”). A fourth is that children's lexical acquisition is remarkably swift – much swifter than that of adults, and with no evidence of effort; it ‘just happens’ at a rate of approximately a word a waking hour between the ages of two and eight. A fifth is that children acquiring sign languages appear to succeed at the same time rate as hearing and speaking children. A sixth is that child multiple-language acquisition proceeds at the same rate for all. A seventh is that for most people, completely fluen t second-language acquisition appears to be difficult after a critical acquisiti on period has passed, indicating that (at least for most people) there is a critical period for effortless language-sound acquisition. Eighth, a child adopts the accent of – most likely – his or her child cohort (with Chomsky , in a part of Philadelphia), not the accent of parents: the mind ap pears to be ‘tuned’ to these patterns. And there are ot hers. All of these observations, particularly when taken together , seem to make it reasonable to accept a nativist rationalist research strategy – at least, if you want to provide explanations. By way of contrast, consider what one should expect if the empiricist story were correct. Children would vary widely in rate of acquisition, depending on training time received, general intelligence, degree of concentration, efforts of trainers, and the like. Some might fail to develop a language at all. Communication would be haphazard: assuming equal ability to learn, it would depend on two children receiving the same training in the same lan guage, with equal degrees of concentration, focusing on pretty much the same set of words (hence, concepts and sounds), and so on. But noth ing like these scenarios is found in normal cases. In this respect, the empiricist research strategy appears to be running against some simple facts and observations. Perhaps empiricists should either abandon their strategy as non-empirical, or co me up with some reasonable answer to the question of why the facts so clearly favor the rationalist's choice of a nativist and internalist research program. Judging by a lack of a mass movement towards the rationalist option, the first option is clearly unacceptable. The second is ignored. In sum, the rationalist is a nat ural scientist of the mind who not only proceeds to try to construct a theory that meets the standard conditions on a naturalistic theory , but does so by assuming further that the study of mind should focus on parts of the mind: Chomsky's calls them “men tal or gans.” The traditional term is “facultie s” and now one often speaks of modules. These parts or modules according to the rationalist can plausibly be conceived of as (largely) innat e, or built into the mind from birth, even though requiring development o r growth that is sensitive, in part, to input or experience. In effect, the part of the mind in question has the characteristics and nature that it does in its finished state because those characteristics and nature are ‘antic ipated’ in the mind from birth – understood, n ow , as built into genetic and other natural factors that control growth and development. Experience or input has a role, but it is primarily that of “triggering” possible characteristics and states. It does not literally shape the mind out of some kind of pl astic material, as the empiricist insists it should. And – for the ratio nalism represented in Chomsky's work – the methods of research for the mind are the same as those for physics and chemistry and other natural sciences , although applied to different domains. Applied to the mind, similar points obtain: a n atural science of the mental system vision may be as biolo gically and physically (and chemically, etc.) constrained as a natural science of language, but there is no reason to think that the two mental sciences need to use the same primitive terms, or emplo y the same operational (computational) principles. In co ntrast, for the empiricist, experience or ‘input’ does (must) shape the mind; the “contents” of the mind have the characteristics that they do because they have resulted from some kind of learning or training procedure of a domain-general sort, a “generalized learning procedure.” Unsurprisingly , the empiricist allows for little innate ‘mach inery’ – in particularly austere cases that are rarely found today , perhaps a few sensory qualities plus a generalized learning procedure. And since the empiricist holds that the character of the mind results through experience from the nature o f the outside world, the empiricist is committed to assuming that the mind must be studied as part of a particular environment. Rationalists are clearly nativists, while empiricists try to minimize nativist commitments. Notice, though, that these comm itments are not of themselves claims about the natu re of the mind or the world. They are rather claims about how it would be r easonable to pr oceed to construct a science of mind and – for the POS observations concerning language – of language. Of course, as mentioned, if the rationalist does proceed to construct theories by relying on this methodological strategy, and if the theories turn out to be successful and make progress where empiricist efforts do not, the rationalist can reasonably say not only that the strategy is correct, but that the entities and events postulate d by the theory are ‘there’, and that the theory describes things as they are. Given too that any such theory is a theory concerning the ‘machinery’ of development or growth as it applies to languages and that any description of initial and final states of an individual's language (I- language) depen ds on the correctness of the developmental theory , one can say that the commitment to nativism is in fact a commitment to the innateness of a kind of automated developmental procedure. We have seen that the POS observations justify choosing a nativist research strategy. Now , what besides the success of theories that are constructed on internalist grou nds justifies the rationalist in choosing to assume that his or her target is an or ganic system inside the mind? The CALU observations play a role here. Typically ignored in his efforts by virtually everyone else in the various fields of cognitive science, Chomsky has at least since the 1960s emphasized the importance of CALU observations in choosing strategies and targets for the study of mind, and especially the study of language. The observations are not new . Descartes first stated them in part V of his 1637 Discourse , where he noted how spontaneous and creative human language use is. Perhaps the reason that Descartes was so interested in this creative activity is that he was a scientist who believed (in correctly , of course) that he had managed to produce with his cont act mechanics a theory of everything, or at least, everything that could be described as ‘body’. These observations convinced him that his mechanics coul d not apply to language use. His deterministic contact mechanics, he believed, explai ned even the behavior and actions of the entire an imal kingdom; it treated all action and reaction as the result of ‘mechanical’ causes. Yet if the theory applied there, and it was a universal theory , it should also apply to the behaviors and actions of human beings. The CALU obse rvations convin ced Descartes that it could not. Specifically , some observatio ns convinced him that at least those actions that amount to the p roduction of sentences coul d not be predicted by the theory , and would have to be explained in a dif ferent way . I summarize Descartes's observ ations. First, the sentences produced by a human being appear to be uncaused by either external or internal factors. You might remark on the newes t planetary discovery orbiting some distant star in a contex t that has no connection to the star or the planet either in discourse or in your thought. You might, for example, be sitting with a friend at a cof fee bar, discussing the antics of various politicians. Second, the sentences produced by human beings in specific concepts can be of an endless number of form s. Perhaps you were asked for directions to Boston; you might answer at length, or be brief, and accomplish the same thing. Y ou might want to impress with your erudition, or dismiss with a few short phrases. Or for some other reason. There is no upper limit on the number of sentences you can use, and no limit – save that of boring a listener , or perhaps losing the thread or confusing yourself – on their length. And the same ap plies to yourself on ano ther occasion, or to anyone else now or at any othe r time, with regard to any ‘task’ performed with words, such as telling someone that they are o ffending you. The third observation is that despite the fact that a sentence is neither caused nor subject to some limitation with respect to a spe cific discourse context, what people say is typically rational and coherent: it is appropriate for the relevant discourse circumstances. Perhaps a remark about the few good bassoon players left these days would not count as appropriate in a situation where someone was walking into danger – unless, pe rhaps, you want them to walk of f the cliff, and you hope that mention of a lack of bassoonists will distract them enough to do so . But many other contexts would permit it, perhaps as a piece of whimsy – or perhaps an indication that whatever the current topic of conversation might be, you're bored, or you want to change it. Or perhaps there's someone overhe aring who will be of fended by what you're saying and you're warning your friends, etc. The point is clear: even when uncaused, an unlimited number of sentences can remain appropriate to some sp ecified circumstance. Only rarely do listeners fail to see some kind of co nnection, and cases where there is no apparent connection are likely to be classified as cases where the speaker is insane, in some way mentally deranged, or perhaps just a failed poet. The utterance is likely to count as the product of ‘rational causation’ – which is by no means causal as causality is understood in a naturalistic theory . It amounts instead to “caused by the person who is taken to be a rational agent.” Imagine 15 eyewitnesses to a train derailment asked in a court of law to provide as clear and objective a description of what each saw as they can. A court of law is a controlled situation, where one is most likely to find repetition, if it is to be found anywhere short of the restricted communications one might find on an assembly line or at an operating table. Yet it still would be surprising to find in the court tran scriptions a single case where a sentence was exactly repeated. Even if all are different, though, all sentences produced by the 15 are likely to be appro priate to the circumstance an d to the request that each provide an objective description. The idea that a given circumstance calls for one, two, or at least a limited number of appropriate or correct responses is just nonsense. And that is fortunate, for if language use were regimented, it would become very boring very quickly . There are cases where some regimentation in use is useful, and people are willing, even intend to conform. These are found in mathematics and the advanced formal sciences, where precision in speech and writing is justified: if you are proving a theorem, for example, you do not want to allow ambiguity, metaphor , nuance, changes of topic, and the like. So your speech in these restricted contex ts is controlled and careful, using accepted terms in accepte d ways. Ordinary speech is not at all like that: it is highly variable, and invites creativity and what the philosopher Immanuel Kant called “spirit.” That is why lively chatter and gossip – among many other spontaneous and uncaused manifestations of speech – are so appealing to participants. There are nevertheless some who would like to believe that the use of everyday language is or should be like that found in mathematics and the scien ces; we look at some of the motivations behind this odd attitude later. Particularly clear cases of free use of expressions are found in acts of referring. There are philosophe rs who would like to have the referents of words such as names tied to things, so that – for example – the referent of “Moses” is the biblical human, not the butcher down the block or the cat on the prowl. They want reference of such terms to be “rigid,” and seek various ways to convince other s that it is. But it is not fixed, even in the supposedly obvious case of proper names. Referring is something that people do. Words – including names – do not refer; people refer with words, applying the internal properties of words (meanings) in whatever ways that they think appropriate. What fo llows fo r internalism? The point should be clear: if you are going to try to construct a natural science of language, you should avoid trying to construct a theory of how language is used by people for various purposes, including how language is used to apply to the world to speak to any number of practical problems. Language acquisition and the internal operations of the language faculty are not creative, but language use by people is, and nothing creative or that allows for – and here, invites – the exercise of free will can be the subject matter of a natural istic theory . Naturalistic theories succeed where nature establishes its own order (or random chaos, as the case might be), and in the case of biological entities, including or ganism-internal or gans, this order depends on genomic and other forms of constraint of the ways in which an or ganism and the or ganic systems in it develop, and how when developed they ‘work’ as internal systems with specific ranges of inputs and possible ranges of outputs. So if you want a naturalistic theory of language – and for Chomsky , a naturalistic theory is the on ly kind worth having – you had better try to construct a theory of the lan guage or gan in the heads of people, of how they grow , and how they operate. What about mental or gans other than language; should their study also adopt an internalist strategy? The CALU observations do not seem to apply to them in as straightforward a way as they do to language , because – among other things – these systems seem to routinely deliver to us what we think of as corre ct representatio ns of ‘the world out there’. But it does not follow that with them – vision, for example – one can and should construct a theory that includes in its subject matter reliable and determinate relations to the world. David Marr's computational theory of vision, for example, focuses entirely on what happens at the retina and beyond in the cortex. His Vision (1982) has often been misread as an attempt to insist that computational theories in general, and in particular theories of vision, must deal with head–world relation ships (cf. Burge 1986). But anyone who actually looks at what the theor y is a theory of (Egan 1992) knows better. There is no doubt that as with so me uses of language, relations to the world are of great in terest to people. People want to know how reliable a navigational or identificational aid vision is, for example – usually, of course, quite reliable, even though there is nothing ‘out there’ in the world as described by physics and chemistry that is actually (say) a bright yellow box. But as with language again, there are no serious naturalistic theories of head–world relationships, no strictly uniform and nature-orda ined head– world relationships. And there is no need for them, because the mind largely ‘makes’ the world. Given a strategic commitmen t to internalism and the success of naturalistic theo ries constructed on its basis, Chomsky takes an interesting step that is invited by an internalist approach, but often resisted even by some who agree that an internalist research strategy is a good one. Adopting a version of what is sometimes called a “constructivist” view of head–world relationships, he endorses the idea that to find out what kind o f world we live in and can know by using commonsense concepts alone, it is a good idea to study what is in the head, not look around ‘out there’. Consider , for example, the issue of what a per son is – the issue of ‘the nature of persons’ or ‘the human essence’. Like the philosopher John Locke in his essay concerning human understanding, Chomsky holds that to answer this question, you should not look outside at Jane and Joe, but inside at what the concept PERSON is, what its intrinsic ‘content’ amounts to (C&M: 27, 2000). The concept PERSON is – and here Chomsky differs from Locke, who believed that people create the concept PERSON – one of the many innate commonsense concepts that are formed automatically during the process of growth, and in fact formed (perhaps only in part) at a very early stage as a part of a child's developing ‘theory of mind’. This and other concepts provid e a point of view, a kind of perspective with which to or ganize experience and think about or describe a person. After all, it is not as thoug h you or anyone else can somehow look at persons and compare what yo u find with the concept PERSON. That is because the co ncept itself provides the way – of fers the tool with which – you can see, describe, think of, and in all other ways cognize persons. The limits of your conception of a person are set by the nature of the concept. This should not be a surprise; it should be a commonplace, for in order to understand anything at all, you must have and exercise the concept or concepts that constitute your understanding o f a thing, situation, event, etc. The point only turns into something that sounds somehow radical when you take an internalist approach seriously and recognize that it follows that to study what it is to be a pe rson, you should look in the head. To do that, of course, you construct a theory of the co ncept-forming mechanism that effortlessly prov ides us our commonsense concepts. Granted, much of your evidence about the nature of the co ncept PERSON comes from the ways we use the conce pt, but it by no mean s follows that the conc ept PERSON is somehow shaped by what persons out there ‘really are’. Given this kind of constructivism, it also follows that the limits of (the concepts expres sed in) our (natural) languages are the limits of our (commonsense) world, to adapt a phrase of Ludwig Wittgenstein's in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus . Similar points apply to the sciences, although there is the very impo rtant difference that we humans invent the concepts of the sciences, at least to a degree – and the equally important difference that the world yielded to our understanding by the concepts of the advanced sciences which postulate ‘hidden’ entities and events is very different from the world of commonsense objects and events. It follows that no n atural science has built into it the concept PERSON, with the possible exception of a not-yet-realized science of commonsense concepts. A science of that sort would in effect be a science of the system or systems that ‘assemble’ commonsense concepts automatically and witho ut training, and thus a science that could provide an inventory (unless infinite in number) of possible commonsense concepts. Some people are working on it, but not yet with much success. For some details, see chapter 6 . It should not be difficult to understand why Chomsky rejects the externalist appro ach to the study of mind adopted by the empiricist. He also rejects an associated notion, the idea that the mind, including language, is essentially an instrument for “ representing” the things ‘out there’. That view is just another aspect of the common but misguided focus of those who study the mind by looking not to native systems and what they provide for use, but to the use of those systems by people to solve problems. It is a common view, but one that we must reject if we are to understand language and the rest of the mind in a naturalistic scientific way . To return to the issues with which this chapter began, we can no w provide tentative answers. There is knowledge of language. That knowledge is not accessible to the person who has it. It is accessible to the scien tist of mind who constructs a science of an internal system, including (in principle, since this has not been achieved) lexical (sound and meaning/concept) resources. The person who “knows a language” can be said to know it implicitly at the earliest stages of language development, and when mature, to have it in one of its many natural forms – even though he or she is neither conscious of what he or she knows, nor able to defend the relevant knowle dge. As for how that knowledge is acquired : the currently available answer to that will have to wait until the chapters on language. Here it is enough to say that knowledge of language grows through input that is channeled towards a mature state through devoted bio logical and general chemical, physical, and computational background cons traints. As for how it is used: when it comes to the issue of how it is used by a person, science has nothing to say, other than to gesture in the direction of an explanation of why nothing can be said. Science can, however , speak to the question of how language ‘communicates’ with other systems in the head in perception, articulation, and und erstanding. The matter of a brain mechanism is still out of reach, and likely will remain so for some time. There is some success for vision, but not language. As for the evolution of language: it is discussed below . No tes 1 A caveat for those who are familiar with David Marr's theory of vision and his view of the ‘levels’ of a computational theory: the vision questions are not Marr's. For discussion, see below . 2 There is reason to believe that he did not even perform some of the experiments he reported. 3 I am aware that Fodor and any number of psychologists would disagree on this matter . 4 As Chomsky notes (C&M: 37), it is clear that not everything about language and language production can be captured in the kind of naturalistic theory we have been discussing. Prosody (such as linguistic intonation) cannot, because it is a global property . It is influenced by discourse ef fects such as irony , by various considerations involving emphasis, and so on. It is not something that – like the core computational system – builds phrases and sentences piece by piece. It is not subject to the kind of idealization and simplification that yields good natural sciences. 5 See, for example, Searle's (2002) New Y ork Review of Books review of Chomsky (2000a). For a defense of Chomsky's view , see my (forthcoming). 6 Shouldn't the child's mind have to have negative evidence too – cases where the child is corrected after producing a sentence that does not follow the rule? Since there are no clear examples at all of such cases, and children do not appear to ever make such errors, it would be foolish for the empiricist to demand them. Those who nevertheless believe that some kind of negative evidence is required (for otherwise the notion of training the child (or the child's mind) makes little sense) have sometimes claimed that the lack of negative evidence is a form of negative evidence. 7 Postulating more than one complicates matters to such an extent that it would be dif ficult to take the view seriously at all, especially given how much easier it is to accept the rationalist's advice to expect a native system, and give up that assumption only if one is willing to abandon the tools of naturalistic scientific research. For the naturalistic scientist expects the explanation of structure to be found in nature – in this case, in the instruction set that leads to the production of a stable final state for the language faculty – and not in some kind of learning procedure that shapes a plastic medium of some sort. T o do that is to accept a form of methodological dualism. 3 Partitio n in g the Min d: Bad an d Go o d Co gn itive Scien ce Problem-solv ing and bey ond How do you par tition the mind? You break it up into what used to be called “faculties” and are now called “modules.” But what are these, and how , exactly, do you do this? Ever since Plato and others of his time and since, the more-or -less accepted view of how to go abo ut sectioning the mind is to assume that the mind is a probl em-solver , where the problems are those encountered by people in their lives. Then you partition the mind by appeal to a set of assumptions about what kinds of problems need to be solved, and by designating a part or parts of the mind as systems or operations that are designed for and devoted to solving the kinds of problems you mention. In Plato's view, the human mind in its embodied condition has tasks at three levels, satisfying in a balanced way through its choices and actions three needs o r basic problems that people confront. One (an appetitive or ‘irrational’ part) recognizes and deals with very short-term problems such as eating to stop being hungry or scratching to eliminate an itch. A second, ‘spirited’ part deals with proble ms of longer duration: developing a career, raising children, etc. This part was portrayed as being persuaded by a third part (the rational part with ultimate goals) to force the irrational part to comply in the overall task for the mind: increasing a soul's degree of ‘knowledge of the good’ sufficiently that the person – or at least his or her mind – becomes immortal. Plato's picture of the mind/soul, portrayed in considerable degree by appeal to Greek myth, has beco me a piece of myth itself. While extremely influential in various branches o f philosophy , including moral and political discussion, it clearly does not co unt as science. There is a general lesson in that. While the prospective scientist of mind should attend to all sorts of data and ways of conceiving the task of dividing the mind, he o r she should be suspicious of most efforts to partition the mind that appeal to the idea that there must be some part of the mind that does such-and-such (has a role or fulfills a function) and is designed to do so because a person or or ganism must sol ve some kind of proble m or another as conceived by the would-be scientist. The history of philosophy , the errors of phrenology , and the incautious effort s to partition the mind found in too much current work in cognitive scienc e – an example appears below – demonstrate ho w easy it is to go astray in doing this. There is nothing wrong as such with seeking answers to what some part of the mind ‘does’ if this is und erstood in the way the rationalist does – as looking for and aiming to construct a natural science of some biophysically innate internal operations of what can be described as an innate computational system that provides ‘information’ to other systems of the or ganism. But that is not what the great majority of philos ophers and cognitive scienti sts aim to do. Perhaps that is because most of them still do not think that the mind can be and should be studied in the way a natural scientist tries to. And unlike rationalists who have learned the lessons taught by the CALU, by the likely impossibility of constructing sciences of action, and by the need for simp lification and a focus on innate systems that develop, they look to data on action and behavior first, and p artition the mind by of fering stories about jobs that they think the mind must do in order to think and act in the ways they depict us as doing. That technique might reveal a system that can be studied using the methods of n atural science adapted to a rationalist research strategy for the study of mind, although the long history of false starts and failures of efforts like this does not inspire confidence. An illustration Chandra Sekhar Sripada and Stephen Stich's “A Framework for a Psychology of Norms” (2006) p resents the authors' view of how to go about investigating par ts of the human mind that are, according to them, involved in acquiring and acting acco rding to norms. Their title promises a framework for studying certain kinds of mental systems. Specifically , it of fers their view of what one should take into account, try to describe and explain, and take to be involved in an activity said to be unique to humans – developing and acting in accord with norms. It of fers, then, a sketch of a methodology fo r the study of the human mind and its parts. Their proposal for a study of norms is typical of contemporary cognitive science and contrasts usefully with another study of norms that explicitly endorses and follows Chomsk y's rationalist natural science study of the mind, that of John Mikhail in his (201 1). Sripada and Stich exclude legal and institutional norms from their study, but appe ar to include a variety of others, although they do not specify the status of epistemic, aesthetic, and like norms. Judging by what they take into account, they propose gathering a wide range of general observations drawn from sociological, anthropological, psychological, cultural, and related studies, all of which seem to them to bear on how people learn and act in accord with norms. To account for these observations, they draw a complicated pic ture made up of boxes (‘boxology’) that according to them represent systems in the head that must be involved in the tasks of acquiring and obse rving n orms. These include norm data bases, motivational systems, rule-related reasoning systems, belief systems, explicit reasoni ng systems, emotion systems, judgment systems, and several others. Perhaps these authors think that this degree of complexity is needed, given the complex of observations they focus on and the emphasis on cultural variability and behavioral mod ifiability. They speak of innateness, but do not appear to mean some system that assumes a specific form entirely as a result of appropriate stimulation plus biological, physical, computationa l, and other nature-based con straints in the way the natural scientist of mind does. There is no attempt to simplify their study and focus on a single system. They do not of fer even rudimentary theories of any of the operations of the component boxes. Lines that are supposed to indicate one box communicating with another only gesture: they do not specify what the interfaces of component systems are, the kinds of information of fered, or constraints on kinds of information that a tar get system might impose. There is nothing wrong with drawing boxes to represent operat ions of or stages of development of a system when the boxes illustrate the operation(s) of systems that theory-relevant observations and established theory require. Chomsky sometimes draws boxes to portray a child's (any child's) development of language and what it involves. His explicit theo ry provides a detailed and evidence-based account of the operations of the relevant components. It specifies what the components contribute towards acquiring a lan guage, yielding a system that yields expressions that yield sound (or sign) and meaning information to other systems in the mind/brain. In part because precision and care are required in constructing a natural science, Chomsk y's theory of language as it stands focuses primarily on the operations of a single system conceived of in isolation from others. This point is illustrated by what is sometimes called the “core” linguistic computational system – the one that combines ‘words’ or lexical items and takes their semantic informatio n to the “semantic interface” (SEM) and their ‘sound’ information to a phonetic interface (PHON). It doe s not apply – or at least, does not yet apply – to those parts of the language faculty that, in an article “Th e Faculty of Language” published in Science (Hauser et al. 2002), the authors call the “fa culty of language, broad.” The language faculty broadly conceived includes assumed but not yet adequately described and explained systems on the other side of the core language faculty's interfac es, systems that Chomsky sometimes calls “pe rformance” systems. Plausible theoretical considerations indicate there are such systems. But there are no established theories of them. The science of language is very restricted. Unlike Chomsky , Sripada and Stich do not say what precisely any of the system(s) they postulate actually ‘do’ – what operations they perform over what specific kinds of inputs in order to yield ‘informatio n’ to other systems. Theirs is preliminary work, at best. It does not meet – or even appear to recognize – the standards of internalist and nativist natural science methodology , the standards of good cognitive science. The difficulty do es not lie in the subject matter. It is clear from the work of others – notably John Mikhail in his (201 1) – that it is possible to construct a naturalistic interna list and nativist science of at least one normative rule system.1 Mikhail's (tentative, of course) results are remarkably successful at consolidating insights from moral and legal theory , commonsense moral gen eralizations, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in what appears to be a universal and innate moral component of the mind/brain. The theory's motivation lies in trying to state what a component of the human mind must ‘do’ in order to yield a set of virtually universal judgments (judgments independent of sex, culture, and (almost) age) concerning the permissibility of certain actions in carefully described circumstances that involve agency and that cause harm in the form of assault or death. The theory precisely specifies relevant inputs, the relevant computational algorithm, and the relevant outputs for the ‘job’ that a co mponent of all normal minds ‘does’ in order to yield well-attested universal judgments on the permissibility of contemplated actio ns. As with language, people whose minds carry out the procedure the theo ry describes are unaw are of it: they are “dumbfounded” when it comes to explaining why they reach the judgments that they do. It is significan t that Mikhail's theory exploits Chomsky's theory of language to get inputs for the operations of his “moral faculty.” By exploiting Chomsky's theory , Mikhail can clearly specify what the moral module needs and takes in the way of ‘input’ from another system. Specifically , he relies on the action-description resources available in the language faculty and uses these to serve as input to his postul ated formal account of a moral module. Unsurprisingly , Mikhail explicitly endorses Chomsky's internalist and nativist rationalist methodology and proceeds in accord with it. This is good cognitive science. Mikhail's theory does not by any means account for everything that figures in people's decisions about ‘the right thing to do’ and that contribute to their actions, any more than the core computational system of language accounts for everything involve d in linguistic action. But as the rationalist aware of the CALU emphasizes, that is to be expected. Human decisions and actions appear to be out of the range of natural science methods. To summarize: Mikhail uses naturalistic rationalist scientific methods for the study of mind; Sripada and Stich's speculations are nowhere near as advanced, either in their concer n for method (e.g., the need to simplify) or with regard to exploiting existing resources. I am not saying Sripada and Stich's speculations – or those of others – are useless. They make some good observations, and sciences inevitably begin with some speculation. But in the case of sciences of the mind, one should by now expect closer adherence to the methods of the natural sciences, acknowledgment of nativist and internalist assumptions, and exploitation of resources provided by systems for which there are good naturalistic theories already in place. That is the way to do cognitiv e science, if the aim is to move beyond boxological psyc hology that tries to construct accounts of behavior and deal with the complexities of human action. The status of cognitiv e science: Fodor's first error Clearly, Chomsky holds that nothing less than a good (by naturalistic methodological standards) internalist and nativist theory of a specific module or mental faculty qualifies as a cognitive science . Assuming this standard, if you try to construct such a natural science and make progress at that task you qualify as a cognitive scientist. As Sripada and Stich's proposals contrasted with Chomsky's and Mikhail's indicate, many who call themselves cognitive scientists have quite different aims and views of theory in mind. To emphasize the p oint, I focus on Jerry Fodor's view of cognit ive science. While Fodor is a self-declared nativist, he is like empiricists an externalist. And he – unlike Chomsky – believes that it is possible to co nstruct a computational theory of the mind that relates perception to action. I focus on that later. Here I'll argue against Fodor's externalism. Fodor in sists that a science cannot be cognitive unless it deals with cognition as he understands it. (His name for this view is the “Representational Theory of Mind” (RTM).) It is not enough to have a science that details the mental tools that a person or other or ganism might employ to think about things ‘out there’ and carry out multiple other tasks. For Fodor , cognitive science must include and rest on what he hopes can be a natural science of denotation o r reference. It must include not just a causal account of how language's, visio n's, and other modules' latent features come to be activated, which is an essential part of any reasonable nati vist view. It must inc lude a nature-based account of how activated inner states stand in a denotational (referential) relationship to things and events ‘out there’. 2 After all, he pro tests, what is an account of cognition unless it makes sense of how the mind relates to the world, and what is cognitive scien ce unless it includes a science of just such a relationship? Chomsky's prin cipled objection to this line of argument and the RTM appeared in the last chapter: reference, denotation, or whatever else you wish to call it is variable and by no means determinate. It is a product of free cho ice. People induce and create ‘referential ties’ on occasions. But that is a product of their acts, no t of nature. Natural systems make reference possible. But they do not create head–world ties. There are other sources of the idea that cognition essentially involves denotation or reference. The intuitions behind the claim that the mind's states are somehow essentially ‘about’ things out there gets support from the ways in which humans speak and think about mental ‘objects’ such as thoughts and ideas. Speaking of an idea, for example, English employs the locution “idea of x” – an idea of dogs, Japan, beeches, uranium, unicorns, or whatever else. Similarly, you find “thought of x” (where x is a situation or event), “desire for/of x,” an d so on. These invite the view that to have an idea or be in some other kind of mental state at all is for the idea/state to somehow ‘contain’ what the idea is an idea of. (This is probably the source of the notion o f “mental content” that anyone who reads the works of contemporary philosophers of mind cannot avoid.) Externalists read the “of” of “idea of x” in a referential way, where the referent is sometimes called the idea's “wide content.” So for them, the content of an idea is the thing or things (or events/states) that a mental state is claimed to denote, or perhaps the property that is characteristic of the relevant things. The internalist reads it in a very dif ferent way . Philosophers have written tomes about the puzzles that arise with Fodor's (and many other s') externalist notion of a mental state. These often appear as discussions of what is called “intentionality .” Philosophers discuss, for example, whether and, if so, how one can have an idea of a unicorn if unicorns don't exist. The discussions can be interesting if you accept the basic pr emise, but – as with many philosophical problems, as Wittgenstein (1953) once emphasized – you should not: they are much ado about nothing. We have here a prime example. One of Chomsky's instructors at Pennsylvania, Goodman, pointed to an explanation for this way of thinking that challenges the view that mental entities essentially refer, and makes supposed puzzles such as thoughts of unicorns disappear . Wittgenstein made a similar suggestion in his Blue Book . Goodman pointe d out that the word “of” in the locution “idea of x” can and should be seen not in a referential way, but as a way of classifying the idea (or thought, etc.) in question. He suggested, in effect, reading the locution “idea of x” as “ x-idea,” where the word in the place of “ x” simply says what kind of idea it is. Or rather, this is not quite what he claimed. Because he was a committed behaviorist and was allergic to mental objects such as ideas and thoughts, he focused on what he thought o f as words 3 such as “unicorn” instead. In effect, he claimed that instead of “ x-idea”, one should say instead “ x-word,” and read this as a way of syntactically classifying the wor d “ x.” He generalized this point, claiming that instead of speaking of a picture as a representation of a unicorn, where it is tempting to speak of the picture referring to a unicorn (as the externalist would have it), one should speak instead o f a unicorn-picture, and understand this as simply a way of classifying the picture as of a specific sort. Goodman's view of a word (and sentences, and syntax in general) was faulty in many ways, but his basic point is easily adapted to Chomsky's view of syntax and lexical items and their combined co mputational products, all of which are clear examples of syntac tically described objects. When this is adapted, the intuition that mental objects are essentially referential disappears, and the notion of mental content can be appropriated for internalist purposes in the way suggested above. In effect, the lexical item unicorn contains within itself the concept UNICORN, where the concept amount s to the cluster of semantic features that our minds employ to characterize these kinds of creatures – or better, configure them. Given this, peo ple with the lexical item unicorn in their mental dictionaries have no difficulty telling stories about and referring to unicorns. And , of course, on Chomsky's view lexical items or ‘words’ are mental objects, for he does not share Goodm an's allergy to mental items. I return to the idea that lexical items include concepts in chapter 6 . Computational theories of the mind: Fodor's second error Another and related difference between Chomsky and Fodor appears in Fodor's view of a computationa l theory of mind. While Fodor was one of the first to emp hasize that the mind must be made up of modules that operate independently of each other , modules as he specified them ended up amounting to receptor and motor -control (peripheral) modules. His definition of modules effectively excluded faculties such as Chomsky's language system (especially in its core form) and other potenti al “central” systems from being modules. That raises several questions. One is: what happens between input and output modules? Part of Fodor's answer appears in what he calls the “Computatio nal Theory of Mind” (CTM). This ‘theory’ is pu zzling, for Fodor appears to believe that the notion of com putation is best reserved fo r the internal o perations of a module, and yet he denies (1983, 2 008) that there is any module that does what the CTM is supposed to do. It is supposed to serve as a way of understanding how people and other creatures carry out (typically at a subconscious level) thoughts and reasoning that link perceptual inputs to motor outputs. It amounts to an account of rational choice and action and it models something like the kind of tale told about being rational and explaining actions of fered by economists and other social scientists, and psychologists too. I do not want to focus on the puzzling nature of Fodor's account of the CTM, however . There is no reason to, for if Cho msky is right, it arises only because Fodor insists that computation is problem-solving, and insists further that there must be a compu tational theory of problem-solving by people or or ganisms, not by their modules or faculties alone. But, Chomsky points out, there is nothing in the definition of computation that requires that computing be problem-solving (C&M: 31–2). And second, there is no science, and in particular no computational science, of problem-solving by people or or ganisms as a whole. That point is emphasized in the next chapter . On the first point, Fodor , like Geor ges Rey and many others, is simply wrong in believing that problem-solving and relating to the world through some kind of referential or denotational relationship are somehow built into the very definition of computation proposed by Alan Turing back in the 1930s. Turing might have explained his view in part by speaking of humans solving mathematical problems. But unfortunately for Fodor et al., there is nothing at all in Turing's formal definition of computation that supports this view. It is purel y syntactic, involving no denotation or reference. On the nature of syntax, see the discussion early in chapter 5 and C&M: chapter 3 and appendix XI. That difficulty with their view reappears in what Chomsky (2000) points out concerning some philosophers' interpretation of David Marr's famous account of the nature of a computational system in his Vision (1982). As Marr put it, the top level of a computational theory – a level above the algorithmic or formal-mathematical statement level that we find in Chomsky's synta ctic theories of language – consists of posing the problem that the computational system is supposed to solve. In one of his simple illustrations, Marr focused on the problem solved by the progra m built into a cash register: adding, subtracting, etc. values that are entered in the system. Developing then a parallel to introduce his theory o f vision, he suggested that the human visual system aims to correctly represent what vision detects that is ‘out there’. Indeed, he even endorsed – or at least appeared to endorse – J. J. Gibso n's objectivist account of vision, of fering it as illustrating the problem the visual system is supposed to so lve. And so perhaps it is not a surprise that – given this way of presenting his view of a computational theory – many read Marr as claiming that computational theories of vision or other mental systems must speak to reference (or being ‘about’ things and scenes ‘out there’) and its obvious role in what is thought to be correct re-presentation of what is ‘out there’. 4 But appearances are deceiving. Perhaps Marr presented his view in this problem-solving way in order to appeal to the commonsense intuitions of naïve readers to clarify for them what he was up to. Or perhaps he thought it provided some thing like a guide or pointer , indicating to the researcher what he or she might look for . It is not entirely clear what his intentions were. It is clear, however , that there is nothing in Marr's actual formal theory of visual comp utation that deals with correct re-presentation, that requires or presupposes that a computational system is committed to speaking to it, or that deals with anything but what happens insid e the head. His theory begins with degrees of activation of the retina's rod s and cones (which are assigned numerical values) and proceeds to the p roduction of a retinocentric color–shape internal ‘space’ that reconstruct s what the visual system of fers the rest of the mind at a momentary slice of time (approximately , his 2.5-D sketch). It is an internalist and syntactic (formal-mathematical) computati onal theory , through and through. People do, of course, put together and use computational systems or programs for computers in order to solve problems; that is obvious, whether the prob lem in question is word-processing, controlling com puter -aided design or manufacturing, or ope rating an ‘arm’ in space. But computational systems themselves are just formulae for the manipulation of symbols 5 – a syntactic operat ion. Asking what the manipulation is for is placing the computation in the light of its use by a human being. That is where the intuition that underwrites Fodor's problem-solving referenti al view of computation comes from – not from the nature of a computational system itself. No doubt computers are built so that they can run programs that solve problems. But that is a fact about computers (which are tools made by humans to serve a purpose) and their use, not about computational systems themselves. This point should be particular ly obvious in the case of computational systems afforded us by nature, not by humans. To think that n ature-based computational systems are things that essentially have a purpose or serve as tools is to con ceive of the systems as tools built for a purpose, even designed for a purpose. That attitude has a long history going back to Aristotle and before. It is an attitude that appears in various religious views and reap pears (without God) in some views of evolution. It likely has its origin in commonsense underst anding and the kinds of explanations that common sense invites, on which, see below . It does not have its origin in the n atural science of mind, where notions such as purpose and design are either removed or given a neut ral interpretation in terms of the shape or form that something happens to have as the result of natural law (C&M: ch. 8). The universe has a design, but it was not designed. As for the secon d of Fodor's claims, that a computational theory of mind is committed to dealing with p roblem-solving by individual people (and or ganisms, presu mably), it too is simply wrong. The picture on which his account is based, that of a rational person, portrays persons choosing to satisfy their interests and desires by assessing courses of action that reflect their beliefs and choosing to maximize their interests. Chomsky's most fundamental and interesting criticism, based in part on the CALU observations, is that no picture of people's choices and actions can be cashed out in a science, and specifically , a computational science. The notion o f a person (or other or ganism, for that matter) who deliberates and makes decision s does not belong in natural science, but in a separate framework, that of common sense. One sign of its difference is that its concepts are innate, and inevita bly fail in science. They are, however , very useful in dealing with practical problems (where the natural sciences of fer little of any use), and the deliberations, speculations, thoughts, and choices they sup port play central roles in our everyday lives. And people's decisions and actions in various contexts are often regular enough to support the efforts of those who call themselves social scientists. But social science is by no means natural science. There are further objections to the idea of the mind as a problem-solver in the next chapter . The selection– adaptation gambit Wait a minute, though: isn't an o rganic system like the human visual system or language system something that is programmed for a use by nature – in effect, by being selected and made to adapt because it does in fact solve a problem or problems for an or ganism? Fodor does not hold this, but it is a common view. It is, however , an artifact of a naïve selectional view of evolution, and a mistake; for some discussion, see C&M: appendix II. Evolution does not build or design structure or create modes of operation. Nature as studied by physics, chemistry, etc. allows only certain kinds of forms and structures to exist – physical, chemical, biological, and even computational forms. If by accident or otherwise, some form – some novel- for -an-or ganism ‘shape’ or operational option, some modification in structure, etc. – happens to appear in an or ganism, there is a chance it might be used and prove to be useful to the or ganism. If it does prove useful, and it is genetically transmissible, there is a chance (by no means a certainty) that it will persist in a species. But the form or mode of operation itself does not have its use by an or ganism, or group of or ganisms, built into it. It is what it is because that is a form ‘anticipated’ in the set of possibilities available in naturally constrained forms. That is one key to Chomsky's view of evolution. His is a view that focuses on actual and potential chemical, biological, physical, etc. forms, taking them and the natural con ditions that constrain them to be primary , with their use by an or ganism or or ganisms as a bit of history that does not create n ovel for m, but remarks its persistence in an or ganism-th en-species. Language in the form of a mode of operation available in the human mind, and there alone, has the mode o f operation or ‘program’ it does because of the com putational form introdu ced by a mutation in a single individual's head, perhaps a structural modi fication that proved to be trans missible. It turned out to be useful – very useful. But its ‘shape’ is no t due to or explained by selection, a term for which a better substitute might be ‘or ganic persistence’. There is, however , a qualification. In discussions of evolution, you are likely to find the notion of problem-solving in contexts that amount to something like problem-solving-for -a-class-of-or ganisms, where again, however , the problem involved is that of dealing with something ‘out there’. Thus, it is often said that a class of or ganisms adapts to an environment – terminology that invites thinking of the class of or ganisms somehow comin g to better fit what is ‘out there’. Speaking of ecological niches in vites the same kind of view of or ganisms and their relation to an environment. The notion of adaptation is worrisome for some of the reasons mentioned abov e, and its status in evolutionary theory is still disputed. For some discussion and further criticism of naïve versions of evolution, see appendix II in C&M. Whatever the status of adaptation with its apparent externalist comm itments and its role in evolutionary theory , it is important to keep in mind that Chomsky's science of language and its evol ution do not have any externalist commitments. However , does Chomsky allo w for something like the notion of adaptation or ‘fitting’ to internal conditions – although without any referential commitments? The issue arises because for at least a couple of decades, Chomsky has tried to speak to the issue of whether or not the language system he postulates is a perfect solution to the ‘problem’ of producing an endless number of expressions, or sound–meaning paired sentences, and has also spoken of the language system as needing to meet “bare ou tput con ditions” posed by other systems in the head. He addresses these issues in our discussion in C&M in several places. Speaking to them here wo uld requ ire getting into technicalities that cannot be addressed in an introductory text that attempts to cover a lot of territory . It is enough to mention the matter and to emphasize that at no point does Chomsky's science of language make externalist commitments. Modularity : is it enough? On the face of it, the natural sciences of mind not only allow , but encourage partition of the mind. Each system investigated so far has its own inputs and outputs, and its own form of connecting links, rules, or prin ciples. The biophysically based approach to mind supports efforts to “carve nature at its joints.” In effect, it sees the mind as made up of a group of inn ate systems. So let us procee d on the assumption that so far as the methods of natural science are concerned, the mind can and (if it is to be understood in the relevant way) should be cut up into various modules or faculties, where each faculty carries out a set of operations over inputs where operations, outputs, and perhaps inputs are – so far as we yet know – un ique to the relevant module/faculty . The parts of the mind (so far as science is concerned) are the modules of the mind. What are they? The answer is: the ones for which natural sciences have been or can be constru cted. They include language, then. Perhaps, however , we need to take seriously other principles of mental individuation. Chomsky says of the human mind (but no other creature's) that it has available – or makes available – two kinds of cognitive problem- solving capacity: commonsense understanding and science -formation. There are, howe ver, no – and can be no – sciences of these two different kinds of problem-solving, for both allow for creativity, although creativity of different characters. They are not, then, modules, or faculties. Is there nevertheless a case to be made for letting science-formation and commonsense understanding be parts of the (human) mind? I speak to that in the ne xt chapter . To end this o ne, I will explain what Chomsk y and other rationalists such as Descartes take innateness to be. On being innate Perhaps because the empiricist view of mind is the default one, people sometimes reject the notion of innate linguistic mental entities out of hand. But they are wrong. Given the POS observations, it is sensible to assume that much of the mind's content and its systems are innate and to proceed with research on that basis – unless you make no progress. To understand what it is for a mental object to be innate, let us clear away some of the un derbrush, beginning by pointing out three things that a sensible view of innateness is not commit ted to. I will then ment ion some things to which it is committed. 1. Saying that an idea or group of ideas is innate is not comm itting oneself to the view that an innate idea is one of which a child is conscious at birth. There may have been some individuals who actually maintained this view, but it is hopeless on the face of it. It is not even to say that a person who has developed/grown an idea (such as a child who has and uses the concept HOUSE) is conscious of it. The only individual who can be conscious of an innate idea is one who has constructed a naturalistic theory of innate concepts and can state what that idea is in terms of his or her (good) theory . 2. To say an idea or concept is innate is not to say that it will (ever) be ‘activated’, or brought into one's working cognitive repertoi re. If a person n ever receives the relevant triggering input, or if the triggering input presupposes that some other ideas be in place and they by the relevant time are not, nothing will prompt the development or growth (usually virtually instantaneous) of the idea. It is plausible, for example, that no early modern human of forty thousand years ago ever had a need for a concept such as COMPUTER, no matter how broad a group of artifacts that concept is appl ied to, including abacuses. And in the case of an indiv idual human: it is quite possible that no child in an isolated tribe in New Guinea ever had a need to develop such a concept. In contr ast, it is very likely that every such child, and early modern individuals, had need for and did develop PERSON and RIVER. 3. Saying an idea or set of ideas is innate is not stating an hypothesis; to think that it is is to misunderstand the nature of the commitm ent that one makes in saying that an idea or set of ideas is innate. Hypotheses are proposals for theoretical principles; they might be included in a theory if the theory is improved by their inclusion and there is good reason – includi ng evidence – in favor of the hypothesis. But to what scientific theory is “there are innate ideas” a possible contrib ution? I know of none, and have a difficult time imagining that anyone except perhaps a philosopher would construct a ‘theory’ for which this would be a plausible hypothesis. What, then, is a commitment to innateness of an idea or oth er mental entity or principle? It is a methodological commitment, based on POS observations. In the case of con cepts, the observations are clear: children acquire some at a very young age, and by the time of peak vocabulary growth between the ages of two and eight (and after they have acquired a major part of a language, then), they learn about a word a waking hour – an extremely high rate, compared for example to adult vocabulary growth. But speaking of vocabulary growth does not really speak to the matter of conceptual acquisition. That is because in order to ‘learn a word’, one has to alr eady have available the concept the word expresses, and a sound that one's ‘mother tongue’ deems acceptable as a sound for that language. This just raises again in a different context an earlier point: concept acquisition and comprehension precede concept expression, and even small children seem to have a remarkable num ber of concepts in whatever ‘ store’ holds them or perhaps in some cases assembles them on the spot. So the commitment is a commitment – at least initially , and unless there is no progress – to loo k for some kind of mental ‘machinery’ that yields the idea or ideas automatically , given what the machinery specifies as an appropriate input. This view of a commitment to innateness is found in earlier rationalist thinkers such as Descartes and Cudworth. Descartes says what it is to be innate in his Comments on a Certain Br oadsheet ; he notes there that the innateness of (some) ideas is like the innateness of some diseases that are apt to show up in a family, when some set of conditions is met. It is not too deceptive to call his a “dispositional” account of innateness: when put in certain conditions, the body – here, machinery of the mind – develops the disease o r idea. Later in that same work and again in some of his letters, he also introduces a distinction. He distinguishes “innate,” “adventitious,” and “made up” ideas. The former he seems to believe are som ehow built directly into the mind, and he includes among them TRIANGLE and GOD; the seco nd are also innate, but require some occasion to trigger their development. And the third are scientific ideas. He distinguishes the second and third by noting that the second are “common ideas” that are somehow built into the mind, while the third are put together by scientists. The “common idea” (commonsense idea) SUN is triggered (as we would say) in the grow th of the child's mind, while the scientific idea is the scientist's proposal for the nature of the sun, and is distinct and distant from what the child's mind automatically produces. This is just one of the differences noted above between commonsense and scientific concepts, but put in a different way. The puzzle is why he insists on the distinction between what he calls innate ideas and those he calls adventitious. Perhaps one reason has to do with the status of GOD and TRIANGLE in his philosophi cal views. It is difficult, however , to underst and why he seems to have thought that the concepts GOD and even TRIANGLE should not need triggering and growth. Surely they do: all inn ate ideas are adventitious. The interesting distinction then becomes the one between ideas that are inna te but need triggering and those that are scientific, and thus created by human beings. And the theorist's task is that of developing a science of innate ideas, how they are triggered, and how the system or systems that yields such ideas evolved. Incidentally , it is important to emphasize that assuming that various aspects of patterned behavior , from talking and walking to the styles, manners, or ways in which we talk and walk (cf. C&M: 54–7), are to be explained by appeal to innate developmental machinery that is sensitive to environmental ‘input’, although the machinery's range of options is found in the machinery itself, points towards actually getting naturalistic explanations of what behaviorists, “embodiment” and “enactivation” theorists, Theory of Mind defen ders, and others merely gesture at. Call the process by which a minimal amount of input quickly and without conscious intervention yields patterned forms of action and behavior “instinct,” if you wish. David Hume did, and Chomsky mentions that he approves of that way of describing it (C&M: 90), no doubt because that way o f putting it makes it obvious that it is innate in us – essentially , a variation on the Cartesian dispositional theme. The important difference is that unlike Hume, Chomsky hopes to actually find and construct a theory of the “secret springs and principles” that the mind/brain relies on in order to develop the capacity to produce patterned forms of action and behavior . No tes 1 Issues of “execution,” as Sripada and Stich call them (i.e., a person's actual behavior , requiring taking into account complex (and variable) matters of motivation), do not figure in the theory , for good reason. This is connected with Mikhail's insistence on focus and idealization. 2 Fodor believes that he can piggyback his account of denotation on his account of causal activation. In ef fect, denotation is claimed to be established when some thing or class of things ‘out there’ causes the activation. If he were right, the internal state DOG would denote anything that has the property of being a dog ( doggishness ?) even when the sound “dog” that expresses DOG is used metaphorically . 3 Goodman's understanding of words and of syntax in general was very different from Chomsky's, especially Chomsky after he began in the 1950s to develop his naturalistic science of language. That science postulates several mental ‘objects’ and reveals many of the errors in Goodman's behavioristic views. For some discussion of Chomsky's relationship to Goodman, see C&M: ch. 14. 4 Tyler Burge (1986) saw things this way; for criticism, see Egan (1992). 5 The word ‘symbols’ is often read in a referential way , as being ‘about’ something. But see the beginning of chapter 5 to find an explanation of why in syntactic contexts it should not be read this way . 4 Human Pro blem-So lvin g Cap acities What does the mind do? In a word, nothing. A popular an swer to the question of what the mind does used to be to say that it reasons or thinks – and then, usually, to claim that reason (or thought, often assumed to be the same thin g) is what distinguishes humans from ani mals. Descartes adopted a view like this, although he did not simply take the claim at face value, but pres ented it as a reasonable explanation for why his contact mechanical scien ce failed to deal with the free use of langu age. It failed, he thought, because human thought and reasoning – produced by the mind and exhibited in language use – are free, although in some sense caused by a mind, which he in most respects identified with a person. Descartes and others were, however , wrong about mind and reason and their identification of these with what is distinctive about humans. It is best for several reasons, some already mentioned, to say that people reason and think an d in doing so solve pro blems, and that they are free when they do so. T alk about doing things and thus about agents an d agency belongs in the commonsense framework, the framework of persons and the things of concern to them, such as rivers, songs, punts, whiffs, strikes, verges, averages, unicorns, Joe Sixpacks, celebrities, CEOs, governments, and so on. The objects and systems of the scientific framework – the framework in which minds and their parts sho uld be studied – do not act or otherwise do anything, despit e the fact that that is the way we inevitably speak when describing them informally from within the readily accessible commonsense framework. Nevertheless, there is a relationship of sorts between the frameworks: people can be said to think and reason with, or by using, their minds – or more specifically , the conceptual an d cognitive resources that their minds prov ide, whether by nature or by the effort to construct theories. Their minds as seen within science are not agents, but resources, perha ps even tools; from the standpoint of agents, the resources mind pro vides are conceptual tools. From the point of view of the scientist of mind, as we have seen, minds are best seen as assemblages of modules or faculties, where they – or their parts – appear to grow and operate in determinate ways that are fixed by natural law and the various options it affords. Granting all this, we can say that people can and all do reason in a commonsense way by using the resources provided by the minds which nature gave them, employing primarily commonsense concepts and the combinatory cap acities of language to solve endless numbers of practical problems in ways that can be creative. And they can – but only some do – reason in a scientific way by constructing naturalistic theories and adopting the methodolog ical goals of natural science. In effect, human reason amounts to problem-solving, and it takes two forms – one a practical form, and the other a science-constructing one. It yields two different kinds of understanding o f the world, and in a sense, two different ‘worlds’ (Chomsky 1995a). One comes for free to all, and must, if persons are to get around in ‘their ’ world, the so-called “lived world.” The other – the scientific one – comes through natural science theory-construction, and only the capacity to construct such theories and their concepts comes through nature. The theories an d concepts defined within them do not, for they are human constructions. Both, however , are problem-solving capacities, with different aims, applying (using) concepts in ways that enable humans to solve problems in two domains, the practical and the theoretical. Following Chomsky , call the first “commonsense understanding” and the second, “science-formation” (1988a). This is the root of Chomsky's answer to Fodor's (and functionalists' in the philosophy of mind, and many o thers') view that it is possible to construct a computational theory of mind that serves to explain actions, one that speaks to the notion of a rational cause mentioned in chapter 2 . Chomsky's view in this resp ect resembles in several respects Wittgenstein's view that causality belongs in the domain of science and that explanation of action proceeds in what is sometimes called the “ space of reasons.” Reasons are not causes; they are explanations of actions as these are described by commonsense concepts. Asking why someone did something is asking for his or her reasons for doing it; it is not asking for a cause. As for providing a genuine causal accoun t of human actions: to do that, you would have to mobilize the methods of natural science. And as we have seen, while it is possible to exercise these methods on parts of the mind called “faculties” or “modules,” it has proven to be impossible to provide a science of the operations of minds as a whole and of human action. Fodor et al. err in assuming that they can bridge the gap between commonsense understanding and the construction and appl ication of theories, a gap that Chomsky accepts, and honors. What is that gap? Science-formation and commonsense understanding: focusing on concepts Chomsky (1975, 1988a, 1995a, among others) takes seriously a divide between the understanding of the world that one finds with the use of commonsense concepts and that found with the use of natu ral science concepts – those concepts inven ted in and as a scientist postulates a theory . The con trast app ears when you note the gap in ‘internal content’ and thus application and use between false cousin concepts, such as WATER and the scientist's H2 O (actually, multiple H2 Os for the multiple states of this remarkable molecule) and common sense's concept FORCE and the physicist's formally defined FORCEphysics (or again, multiple such concepts). We can explore the gap by trying to capture the differences between commonsense concepts and their scientific false cousins. Why look at con cepts, and false cousin concepts in particular , rather than contrasting the kinds of understanding outright? One compelling answer is that all understanding is mediated by concepts, meaning by that that concepts are something like lenses with certain built-in properties that allow one to see and understand something, and in particular , to see and understand such-and-such with some set of specific properties. If you take this point seriously – and it is hard to see how to avoid it, since we have no direct or unmediated understanding of things and events – and you notice that commonsense understanding begins to appear in the child's development at a very young age (some aspects, including understanding of speech, appear to be in place before the child can articulate or speak), you will also have to take seriously the idea that the concepts employed in commonsense understanding are innate in the sense explained in the last chapter . A consequence of that view of innateness is that innate concepts have the characters or internal contents that they do because their possible characters are fixed by nature. If there were a science of inn ate concepts, perhaps I could use it to express what a specific concept such as PERSON amounts to. But there is not. Because, however , I want to contrast commonsense with scientific concepts and I n eed some way to specify the characters (‘internal contents’) of commonsens e concepts, I will do what almost everyone else does, including those constructing the Oxfor d or another dictionary . I will ask you to take examples of cases where a specific concept is used or applied, and ask you the reader to exercise your intuitions about what the thing or event the concept is used to characterize is and can be. This roundabout way of figuring out what features a concept has amounts to exercising thought experiments of the sort that phi losophers and others have constructed and used for centuries. The tale of the ship of Theseus is a traditional example of this sort. It fo cuses on the “i dentity conditions” that the innate concept SHIP imposes on our commonsense understandings of ships – and likely other artifacts and perhaps some ‘natural objects’ too. Displaying commonsense concept characters In brief, this is the Theseus tale: Theseus gradually replaces each plank and beam in his ship and throws the discard away , ending up with a ship with all new planks and beams. His nei ghbor gathers all of Theseus' discards and builds a ship that is materially identical with what Theseus began with. Each pla nk and beam in the pile of discards is placed in the same position it had in the ship with which Theseus began, and serves the same purpose. Then the question: which is Theseus' ship? Is it both, the rebuilt ship, or the reassembled original? The almost-universal answer people give is the rebuilt one. This reveals the (pe rhaps) surprising fact that in the case of an artifact such as a ship, ownership and an owner's intentions are among the thing's “identity conditions.” The point can be extended to other artifacts. We nee d not look to philosop hical literature to find multiple cases. Chomsky in C&M and elsewhere of fers a real example of his own. With a little thought, you can find or easily construct your own. He tells of reading a story about a donkey to his grandchild. In the story , a donkey is changed into a rock and then turned back into a donkey again. He reports that his grandchild at no time thought that the rock that was a donkey was just a rock, a lifeless entity . It was a rock invested with the donkey's thoughts and feelings and so it was “psychically continuous” (a semi-technical term meaning that the donkey's memories, thoughts, and plans continued from donkey to rock to reconverted donkey). His grandchild had not been taught or told to thin k this way. It came automatically , and would come automatically to any child who had mobilized the apparently inn ate concept of a donkey (or of a human) at all.1 Given this case and the many discussions of personal identity in the philosophical literature, it seems that concepts of or ganisms – whether applied to living persons and creatures or to characters in books, plays, and stories – include something like psychic continuity in their ‘identity conditions’. They must do so, for children (and adults) appear to automatically assign psychic continuity to people, storybook donkeys, living donk eys, dolls, toy dogs, and rocks that have been ‘tra nsmogrified’ (to use the comic character Calvin's term) from living things to o. Notic e that neither this nor other specific features of the concept PERSON could have come into a child's or our heads as a result of learning it, being instructed in it, or by picking it up from observing people, donkeys, etc. It must come auto matically when any child begins to develop specific concepts of living things, some features of which consti tute what is sometimes called a “theory of mind.” This is no theory at all, but simply a set of assumptions that even infants of six months or so seem to respect in the ways they interact with parents and others, for even then they automatically treat persons as agents with intentions and desires – although, of cours e, they do not have the vocabulary to express these features that help make up the concept PERSON. The ways they treat persons reveal what they take persons to be, and these are features of their concept. Aristotle pointed out long ago that at least one class of concepts has some interesting general characteristics that reflect human interests in the things of the commo nsense world. 2 Thing- and event-concepts (typically expressed by nouns) such as ROCK, DOG, WATER, THOUGHT, WALK (as noun), etc. all appear to carry with them in the features that make up their characters answers to ques tions that are of interest to human beings. Specifically , they ‘answer ’ questions about whether they are natural or artifacts (how made, or their origins), about the materials of which they are made, what their natures are (abstract, concrete, etc.) and – crucially – what they are for , what their uses or functions are. These answers are responses to the four “ca uses” that Aristotle took all things (the entities that the relevant concepts are used to describe) to have and display . In the order above, they are the efficient, material, formal, and final explanations. In some respects, the final causes or explanations are for the commonsense framework the central ones, because they reflect the uses of entities, or their functions in some plan to solve a problem, whether ours or some other person's (or personification's, as with gods and spirits). They place commonsense concepts such as these squarely in the domain of human practical (including strategic, p rudential, moral, and politica l) problem- solving, in all cases reflecting an anthropocentric and interest-sensitive view of the world. The con cept PERSON gets the same Aristotelian treatment, of course, inviting the question of what humans are for . Economic systems and religions have not been shy about coming up with answers. In some religions, of course, everything comes out having a function or job, where that function is assumed to be assigned by some divine creature that ‘makes’ the thing or things in an act of creation, much as a manufacturer creates a hammer to pound in nails, where the hammer – like Theseus' ship – remains the property of the manufacturer until ownership changes. These matters are of co ncern to people in their everyday lives. They in terfere with the formation of sciences, for they challenge objectivity , universality , precise formal statement and precision, and so on. Concepts expressed by verbs of fer equally good, often better, examples of the ways in which commonsense concepts reflect human practi cal interests and the actions that embody them. Commonsense verbal concepts can appear even to anthropomorphize the acts of wind on trees (“The wind bent the tree” ), waves on shores (“W aves beat on the shore”), bom bs on cities (“The bo mb destroyed the city”), and so on. The verbs portray the waves, bombs, and wind as having intentions and performing actions, as if they were like persons who act. Verbs also of fer advantages for naturalistic study that nouns do n ot: they display structure. An example of Chomsky's (in 1988a) focuses on the concept PERSUADE. If you say that Mary persuaded Harold to put out the cat, you p ortray Mary as causing Harold to have the intention of putting out the cat. PERSUADE is like a lot of “causative” verbs (where causation is not the causation of science, but that of the commonsense description of actions of agents) in displaying the structure of an agent causing the coming about of a state. It appears in all of the wind, wave, and bomb examples above. It is not learned. Adverbial and adjective concep ts also of fer endless examples o f ways of acting and ways to be, in each case – again – reflecting human concerns, evaluations, and interests. Readers can invent their own examples. As we saw in the discussion of the CALU, commonsense concepts allow for and even invite creativity in the way(s) that they are applied and used. In effect, they prov ide for unbounded numbers of methods or of ways to solve even sp ecific practical problem s. That is illustrated in the few remarks above about the uses or functions of persons. The point is much more general. Anyone familiar with Kahneman and Tversky's (1974, 1982; Kahneman 201 1) work on the nature of different kinds of (commonsense) thinking or reasoning – intuitive as opposed to ‘reasoned’, fast as opposed to labored, type 1 as opposed to type 2 – and the ways in which the latter can with experience become the former will know how flexible commonsense practical reasoning can be, and how difficult it would be to insist that all such reasoning can be placed within a single ‘logic’. Add to Kahneman and Tversky's observations the effects of domain spe cificity, the roles of background and presupposition in ways to construe matters, the way that looking at an issue can depend on experience, the effect of stories told or heard, the way an issue is described, and the efforts of individuals to come up with ways of fitting their efforts to solve problems int o long- and short-term proje cts, and you will have plenty of evidence of flexibility (and sometimes, the efforts of some with power who try to ensure that you act in accord with their wishes). Unlike scientific reasoning, there is no uniform method, or way of being logica l or rational. Commonsense reasoning and understanding exploit the many options made available by innate commonsense concepts (for metaphor , for example) and by the endless expressive resources of language's combinatory potential. Examples with false cousin concepts The concept FORCE as it is employed in commonsense unde rstanding of the world is so far undefined in any naturalistic theory of co mmonsense concepts, but it quite clearly has built into it assumptions about effort expended by an agent (usually by a human being), typically applied through contact with something that an agent wants to move. In the use of this concept (where use displays the concept's ‘content’ and character), the conceptual machinery of action comes into play: intentions, perhaps deliberation, action applied to a passive object that can in turn be seen as being in one place and, if the application of force is successful, in another because it was moved into that second place by the effort that is the application of force. If so, clearly, the commonsense concept FORCE is – like man y other commonsense concepts that are entangled with the notion of an agent actin g or carrying out a task – virtually ‘designed’ for thinking about doing something as an agent, and actually carrying out an intention that is formed. The natural science concept FORCEphysics , on the other hand, has built into it no notions of agency , action, or intention; nothing like contact between surfaces is assumed; any entities involved are not portrayed as active or passive; and the concep t as understood within a particular physical theory is exhaustively and to the extent possible precisely defined by the role of the relevant theoretical term in the theory as a whole. In fact, one of the primary aims of natural scientists since the seventeenth century has been to ensure that no anthropocentric baggage of the sort found in the commonsense concept FORCE be allowed into the theories they construct and the concepts that a theory defines. There is progress. Descartes with his naturalistic scientific method tried to avoid the effects of commonsense concepts, includ ing the concept FORCE. But he was not successful. His mechanics remained a contact mechanics: he assumed without argument that all ‘action’ performed by his matter or ‘body’ involved contact. This influence of the commonsense concept persisted in the “mechanical philosophy” for some time and was not eliminated in the natural sciences until Newton fifty years later allowed for ‘action at a distance’ with his account of gravity. It remains in place in commonsense understanding, of course, and in commonsense understanding's folk physics. The point about a gap between kinds of understanding applies across the board, assuming that there is a science of a relevant sort at all, including the case of water vs. H2 O and commonsense concepts such as SENTENCE, WORD, and MEANING, all of which have scientific false cousins in Chomsky's science of language , but where the theoretical false cousins do not have the use-related (agent-involving) characteristics of the commonsense concepts. As new sciences come into being, they too will display the same gap. Focus now on the commonsense concept WATER and ask yourself what the ‘ content’ of the concept WATER might include, what its character is, as revealed in the situations it might be applied. The commonsense concept WATER (expres sed by the everyday language term water ) is a concept that is virtually designed for use in language and thought by human beings in their everyday lives, where the concept is usually used to solve practical (action-related) problems. The concept is a stuff-concept or one that is used for classifying kinds of stuff, o r material, and the use of the term water suggests this. Kinds of stuff – even ‘stuf f’ like air – are forms of ‘object’ that can often be detected, and detected in particular by humans using their sense or gans. Fo r example, we sense and describe water as a kind of stuff that comes in various detectable quantities in various states described in terms of their containers (cups, glasses, creeks, lakes …), dynamic states (waves, ripples, eddies, flows …), colors, textures (liquid, smooth, soft, prickly), odors, comparative sizes (rivulet, creek, stream, river, flood, drop, puddle, pond, lake, inlet, bay, fjord, estuary, gulf, sea, ocean, etc.), and the like. Sometimes with stuff-conc epts – the concept WATER illustrates this nicely – people gather together a cluster of what are thought to be typical sensory qualities of samples of the stuff and think of this cluster as of fering a short list of ways to quickly distinguish the relevant kind o f stuff from other kinds of stuff. The identifying recipe for ‘normal’ water might include these characteristics: colorless, odorless, liquid, and so on. Notice that these are all readily observed characteristics, useful to us, reinforcing the idea that the commonsen se concept WATER is a concept-for -use-by-us. It is very unlikely that any other creature has just this concept, and it is certain that no other creature can by the use of natural language combine this concept with others to produce an endless nu mber of combined and structured concepts that are also o f use to us. WATER is obviously interest- related and anthropocentric. The concept WATER is anthropocentric in another particularly revealing way too: it has built into it so mething like a catalogue of various ‘use values’, or ways in which water can be used to serve our interests by solving various practical problems. The catalogue is easy to construct: water is stuff used for drinking, washing, swimming, floatin g, diluting, cooling, irrigating, even making and transforming (making cof fee, tea, etc., or making water into cof fee, tea, etc.). The short list here partially itemizes the usefulness o f water to us, the various ways that we humans use water, revealing in a very obvious way the anthropocentric nature of the concept. The scientific concept H2 O is a very different creature. H2 O as understood by the scientist has little to do with the anthropocentric notion WATER. In its dominant state, most of the H2 O in the univers e is thought to be found in comets, where it is in a glassy (amorphous) state, not any of the several crystalline forms found in the ice that we encounter on earth (Chomsky 2000, C&M: appendix I). As fo r the microstates of H2 O: it has several different states over and above its two common and less-than- common isotopes deuterium and tritium. Different bonding ang les and the like give various forms of H2 O different ‘surface’ properties. Among many other things, these differences help explain why when H2 O is frozen, the ice that results forms different crystalline structures. Further, various chemical changes depend on specific forms of H2 O. All this indicates that there is no one ‘ thing’ H2 O that is the same everywhere and at all times (cf. C&M: appendix I). And – crucially for our purposes – none of the various forms in which one finds water seen from the point of view of various sciences reflects any of the anthropocentric (sense- and interest-related) features found with the commonsense concept WATER, classified by commonsense intuition as a non-artifact, or ‘natural’ from the p oint of view of common sense. And as suggested, Chomsky's linguistics of fers several other examples of false cousin concepts, such as SENTENCE, MEANING, SOUND, and the like. Readers can note the contra sts themselves while reading the linguistics chapters. Accepting the gap To encapsulate these remarks and put the point in terms of differences between the ‘worlds’ of common sense and those of the sciences: the commonsense world is a more-or -less unified one composed of a world of objects that are of interest (whether positive or negative) to human beings; they serve or conflict with our projects and interests, and reflect our Aristotelian-like intuitions about what is a natural substance, what not. It is also a world accessible to and largely compliant with the sensory capacities we humans happen to have; it is a world with colored objects that ring, or sound ho llow , or buzz, or ‘just sit there’. The world of natural science is in contrast a world that – to the extent possible, given the stage of the science(s) in question – is divorced from our projects and interests, and one accessible to us not through int uition (guided by commonsense concerns) but primarily through the con struction of theories that often postulate unseen and unheard entities with theory-defined properties, such as muons and – in the case of linguistics – a compositional procedure called Mer ge. None of this sho uld be surprising, much less challenging and shocking, as it was to the clerics and academics of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth cen turies. And in fact by now , the contrast between the world as seen through commonsense concepts and the world as seen through scientific concep ts is in many domains simply accepted, sometimes with a shrug, sometime s with a bit of surprise, but usually with little resistance. Thus, when it comes to what common sense thinks of as natural substances (not artifacts) such as salt, stars, and sand dollars, and events such as lightning strikes, burning, and sexual reproduction, reasonably sophisticated people accept with a shrug that there are important differences in how to understand these in science as opposed to common sense. Consider water again: it is som ething that we usually think of as colorless and wet, something that we use to bathe in, drink, etc., thereby serving our senses and interests. The scientist's H2 O, however , is a complicated molecule with many pr operties that only postulational sciences can reveal. It is not wet, or colorless; to say it is is to misguidedly try to bridge the gap. Resistance to the gap in studying the mind The gap between the two might not be obvious to someone who was unaware of the differences between the commonsense concept WATER and the scientists' various H2 Os. But at least with water and with other natural substances (as they are classified in common sense), there are now fewer who wo uld serio usly believe as the clerics of Galileo's and Descartes's time did that the commonsense view built into their Aristotelian world is the only on e worth taking seriously , rejecting outright the scientific with its ‘occult’ things and properties. As for artifact concepts such as CHAIR and institution-concepts such as STATE, clerics and royalty might at one time have believed that states, at least, are natural objects made by a god, and no doubt so me still put that gloss on their favored government: as Chomsky notes in his political work, states (and to an increasing extent in some circles, econom ies) are too often made into religions, supported only by faith. Nevertheless, on reflection now most would agree that they, like chairs, are artifacts and not even close to being in the running fo r study with the tools of natural science. CHAIR and STATE, like PERSON, are commonsense concepts, with no natural science false cousins, and for most reasonable people, there is no desire to try to find or construct sciences of natural science counterparts. Unfortunately , though, matters do not go so smoothly when it comes to sciences of the mind. While co ntrast and the gap may be accepted with a shrug in some domains, they are so far not so easily accepted in the study of mind. The same points about gaps between objects in the commonsense domain and those in the scientific should hold for our biologically based minds (o r at least, their parts) and our scientific studies of them. But too often when it comes to the study of mind, and in particular the study of language, the grip of commonsense (and empiricist) views remains sufficiently stron g that it trumps any serious effort to pursue the methods of natural science. Many – including many who would like to be called scientists – continue to simply adopt the commonsense view that language is an artifact and a skill taught by “masters” of a language to the young of a community , and that a good way to investigate language is to see it not as a natural o bject (an “or gan” of the mind/brain, as does Chomsky), but as a specialized behavioral pattern that is taught to the young by training and correction of mistakes. It is construed as a human institution like a complex game with rules of use of language's tokens (words), or – perhaps better – a practice that is created by humans to serve a need or needs (the need to communicate is a very popular choice) and taught to other humans so that they can meet their need(s) too. The view is exp ressed, although not always in such a forthright manner , in the work of p rominent and very influential philosophers such as Wilfrid Sellars (1962, 1 963) an d David Lewis (1975). If this view were to be taken seriously , language should be studied as are other social institutions, practices, and acquired skills, by using the ‘behavioral’ tools of the social sciences, not the tools of natura listic scientific inquiry . Langua ges on this view are skills and abilities that can be mastered, and like other skills, they are taught. Of course, language can be studied in this way; sociolinguists do just that, for they study usage. But to insist that this is the only way to study language, and – worse – to believe that studying it in a way that refuses to see that a successful naturalistic science of language presupposes that language is a ‘n atural object’ that develops automatically (for examples of this attitude, see Morris et al. 2000; Sellars 1963), is dogmatic. These individuals are in some respect s worse than the clerics of the seventeenth century . The clerics, unwilling to give up on the anthropocentrically oriented assump tions about what things are that are built into commonsense concepts and Aristotle's picture of the world, could at least claim ignorance about the methods of natural science and its results – not much of an excuse for anyone claiming to be an int ellectual, but understandable. Their modern counterparts, however , cannot claim ignorance of the methods and results of naturalistic inqu iry, nor can they say that there is no established naturalistic study of languag e in place. In fact, at least some of their research consists in trying to get neural networks to learn through training procedures how to produce output s that approximate those that a person fol lowing the principles and rules that Chomsky and colleagues' theories of the language faculty propose. Chomsky calls this devotion to commonsense concepts of language and mind and empiricist methods “methodological dualism.” Those who cannot abandon the commonsense view of language and try to construct a naturalistic theo ry of the language system might be happy enoug h accepting the gap between WATER and H2 O, but refuse to employ the methods of natural science in studying language, and often other mental systems. Encapsulating the differences One way to summarize what we have done so far is to focus on the different natures of commonsense and scientific concepts. Here is a list of groups of differences: Commonsense concepts 1. are reasonably assumed to be innate (in the Cartesian sense, as dispositional); 2. are anthropocentric (primarily human interest- and action-related); 3. are rich and (so far) undefined, although (in principle) targets of a naturalistic theory of mind (including growth); 4. are very flexibly used in variou s ways and applied (in metapho r, for example) in a diverse set of circumstances, invite creativity, and appear to be domain-general; and 5. are constitutive of an understanding of ‘our ’ world, which is the world of everyday practical af fairs. Scientific concepts 1. are prima facie invented or created (in the course of inventing a theory); 2. are (made to be) as objective and interest-free as possible; 3. are (made to be) austere and are currently definable in terms of the theory in which they are lodged via the role they play; 4. are typically used carefully in restricted contexts; when used to refer, they are used in a regimented manner with reasonably uniform results; and 5. are constitutive of an understanding of a specific domain of phenomena that is (generally) thought to be alien to ‘our ’ world. The emphasis in the first group of differences is on what we can reasonably assume in construct ing a science or sciences of the mind; that has been amply discussed. In the second, the emphasis is on the ‘characters’ of the concepts and – thus – on how they are understood and used/applied. The third group points to the fact that no ordinary dictionary has ever really defined a commonsense concep t. At best, dictionaries such as Webster's or the Oxfor d report usage and /or hint by of fering a few characteristic features. But they do not in any way fully reveal the richness of conce pts such as WATER or even of artifact conc epts such as TABLE. That is not a problem, however , since these concepts are already in the repertoires of individuals, or readily acquired: even if no one has defined them, or so far can do so, no one with the concept has difficulty recognizing when such a concept is used appropriately , including its use in metaphor and other forms of figurative thought and speech. This is a go od reason to think that the person ‘has’ the concept. The fourth group of differences bears on the use of concepts in various forms of problem-solving. In mathematics and the natural sciences, the p roblems to be solved are theoretical, and require care and precision in use, while the use of commonsense concepts is diverse and creative. Since they are interest- and project-related, they are used to deal with the extraordinary number of highly contextually dependent matters with which people have to deal in their everyday lives. Rarely is there a single best solution to such problems, although to save time, people ofte n default to routines. Nevertheless, they can with their commonsense concepts engage in storytelling, gossip, and other forms of creative use. And they can and do get considerable satisfaction from doing so. Finally , the last group of differences: here, the point is that the ‘worlds’ that the relevant kinds of concepts can be used to describe are very different from each other , different in ways that reflect the characters of the concepts involved. The status of capacities What is the status of problem-solving capacities, the ways in which reason appears? One thing is clear: they are not faculties. Faculties are internal, innate systems and are or can be the subject matters of natural sciences of mind. Their modes of operation can be captured in biophysically based natural laws. Capacities may be enabled by faculties; it is difficult to imagine how to get the flexibility we enjoy in human practical problem- solving without a language faculty, for example, and science-formation would not be possible unless language's combinatory operations provided us with the recursive and hierarchical operation on which the natural number series depends. No other creature can count with integers; almost all humans can (see C&M: ch. 1). On the other hand, capacities are not mere human creations, products of invented symbolic practices, as postmodernists and ‘analytic’ p hilosophers like Wilfrid Sellars (in his 1962 “Philosophy and the Scientif ic Image of Man”) with their anti-nativist and externalist (empiricist) assumptions would have us believe. Apes – some of which have quite go od ‘general intelligence’ – have neither the flexible practical problem-solving capacity of commonsense understanding nor a capacity to form sciences as humans do. Presumably, this is due in part to the fact that they do not have language. There are, of cours e, differences. While all normal humans exercise commonsense understanding to a considerable extent (they have to in order to survive), not all have exercised the capacity to construct scientific theorie s, especially in their modern form. Postulating unseen gods and spirits of the sort found in primitive and modern religions might be seen as primitive efforts to provide explanations of events that puzz le, and thus primitive exercises of a science-forming capacity . But they are far from exercising the methods of the mathematical sciences. Yet as Chomsky points o ut (1988b), an early modern human infant raised in the modern world would not only develop an d apply commonsense concepts, but would at least be capa ble of constructing natural sciences. Both co mmonsense understanding and science-formation have been capacities of humans (humans after the introduction of language to the species) all along. Becoming a natural scientist as we understand it is possible only for those born after the invention of natural science methodolog y and the introduction of the required infrastructure, such as an economic system able to support ‘useless’ fundamental research, plus the introduction of educational and related institutions. Nevertheless, the basic point remains: all humans have the capacity to develop commonsense understanding and to form sciences. I emphasize that other creatures do not have our common sense, for ours depends on our concepts and on language. And they certainly do not have science-formation. We can, then, think of commonsense understanding and science-formation as uniquely products of the human mind. Perhaps we have oth er capa cities too. But so far, these appear to be the only ones we have available. And in that limited sense, we could say that these two problem-solving capacities are ‘parts’ of the human mind without – of course – being faculties. There can be no science of problem-solving. Chomsky's position seems to be like Descartes's. Descartes called commonsense understanding “ bon sens ” or “good sense” and conceived of it as based heavily on innate concepts. “ Bon sens ” is usually (and correctly) translated as “common sense.” Descartes's bon sens was of little to no use to the scientist, although it was essential for resolving practical (“moral”) issues. And his science was defined by a method that he (very proudly) had an important role in inventing, as we have seen. Nevertheless, he thought of the method as one that anyone could employ , so long as they managed to abstract themselves from everyday affairs and the influence of commonsense concepts (this is an aspect of Descartes's skepticism) and strictly follow his prescription for carrying out this kind of research. Unfortunately fo r his efforts as a scientist (see the end of Chomsky 1995a), his science remained in the grip of the commonsense concepts BODY and accompanying concept FORCE. They led him to assume that only ‘mechanical’ explanations of action would suf fice. Natural limitations on the mind Descartes in his Discourse (1637) claimed that the mind could with enough effort solve any problem. He did not specify what kind of problem he had in mind – practical or theoretical. He did, however , believe that God (for which we can read ‘nature’) provided only a limited number of innate concepts for use in the practice of what he called “ bon sens ,” or common sense. So perhaps he believed that his scientific method coul d solve any problem. That is a common belief, then and now . He was patently wrong, of course, on grounds that he himself maintained, for he held that science- formation as he understood it could not solve the problem of how humans managed to act freely. He had an excuse of sorts: he thought that the mind was not a part of nature. So he might have believed that it (humans) really could manage to solve any problem, that science-formation is not restricted. Chomsky , however , maintains naturalistic views, through and through. The human mind then is – as we have seen – a product of biophysically constrained grow th. So too with all its parts, including language. Each part originates in mutation and evol ution, either through primate ancestors, or through mutation of what became Homo sapiens alone. Because of this natural base, Chomsky holds that our problem-solving capacit ies must be limited. There is no universal problem-solving system, or collocation of systems. That should be obviou s with common sense: it is hopeless in the scientific domain, although flexible enough in the practical. But it should also be obvious for science-formation. W e still do not have, and are unlikely to get, an explanation of the facts that Descartes pointed to that Chomsky calls “the creative aspect of language use.” It is an example of an issue that appears to be beyond the range of science as we understand it. As pointed out, we have no difficulty employing the tools of co mmonsense understanding in coming up with explanations in the form of reasons for why someone did what he or she did. But that is not science. Look at it this way. Assume that science can deal with doma ins where there is determination, or with domains where there is randomness. The problem with ‘rational causation’ (which is what we are dealing with when speaking to why someone did something) is that it appears to be free and undetermined but nevertheless appropriate. In effect, it displays the characteristic features of the CALU. Assume further that any science of the mind is committed to looking fo r modules. This is not to say that the mind is necessarily made up of modules, but it is to say that that is what a natural science of the mind can deal with, if a causal theory is in question. Since science-formation and commonsense understanding appear to be the only human cognitive capacities (problem-solving capacities) we have, this is not a trivial poin t. Assuming both of the above, think about how one would provide a determinate causal theory of human action or behavior . There is no who le-mind causal theory , and we are unlikely to get one. So, committing ours elves to modules all the way through, we begin with inputs (visual, auditory , tactual, proprioceptive …), then go through systems that these feed (ob ject recognition/response), through language and other possible more central systems, and then eventually to motor systems. In order to do any of this, we have to assume some relatively fixed environment, for variations in input can yield very different assessments and reactions; the probability that one can actually find such a stable environment is another matter. Then take into account the influence of memory , mood, degree of fatigue, and so on; and add to this the fact that some systems seem to need no prompting at all, such as language. Add then various ‘output’ systems, eventually leading to motor control units. Now , ask yourself how likely it is that you are going to find a univers al answer to the question of how person P (any person) in circumstance s C can be predicted to produce behavior/a ction B. Coming up with an answer would be an accomplishment much greater than coming up with an answer to what in ph ysics is called the “ n -body problem,” which assumes a closed universe with n bodies moving with regard to one another , where the bodies are conceived of as point masses alone, and the problem is to predict where they will be at time t after a point at which their weights and positions are fixed. The mind is not in a closed universe. There are many interfaces between the mind's systems, un like the gravitation of the n -body problem. And system failure, fatigue, neural ion replenishment, different threshold values, and so on and on all make contributions. Since there is no solution to the n -body problem, solutions to the human behavior problem should not be expected soon, or really , ever. We can conclude many things from this, but for present purposes, we only need on e conclusion. Science-fo rmation is limited too. We can only build certain kinds of theories. And the best explanation of this lies in the kinds of minds we have, minds fixed by biology and other constraints on growth. Overview and conclusion The aim so far in this book has been to try to show not just what Chomsky's views of the mind and its study are, but – more important – to explain why he holds the views that he does . Simply describing his views without also addressing the assumptions that lead to his conclusions and explaining why he assumes what he does might satisfy some readers, but anyone who wants to assess the cor rectness and importance of his views had better first come to understand why he hold s the views he does. That is particularly important where – as is so obviously the case with Chomsky's work – his views differ so much from mainstream views of language, the mind, and the study of mind. Since his primary interest in the mind's parts and in langu age is to try to construct a science of them, exploring his assumptions concerning how to study these ‘entities’ in a scientific way has focused on the methodology of n atural science, and on the specialized assumptions one must make in order to adapt the methods of natural science to the scientific study of mind. The discussion of Chomsky's views of the mind and of language in it began with the four questions on which several of Chomsky's o wn attempts to explain his views focus – the questions of what knowledge of language is, how it is acquired, how it is used, and how it is embodied. Because the only answers to these questions worth having are those that a natural science could give us, however , it quickly turned to the question of how one defines a science, and of how to construct one – specifically , a natural science, which is the only kind that Chomsky has tried to constr uct, at least after the early 1950s (cf. C&M: 38). The attempt to define nat ural science focused then on methodology , fo r there does not appear to be any other way to define the nat ural sciences than to discuss what their ideal fo rm consists in, where that is captured by in dicating what we demand of a successful natural science. In addition to the obvious reason for adopting this route – specifically , that theoretical subject matters, theory-specific laws and principles, and theory-relevant experimental techniques differ across the range of those sciences that we acknowledge are clear cases of natural sciences – another reason is by now apparent: science-construction is a human capacity , and constrained by the powers but also the limitations of the human mind. Granted, what we can do in the way of constructing natural science s has proven remarkably successful, but there is no discernible reason for their success: no good God who has given us the right kinds of minds and arranged nature just so, and no reason whatsoever for believing that evolution someho w endowed us with the right concepts and ideals. Our success is something of an accident (Chomsky 1980/2005, 1988a, 1 995a, 2 000), although – of course – a welcome one. Defining a natural science by appeal to an ideal leaves some candidates out, not surprisingly . It leaves the social sciences out for a good reason: those sciences cannot avoid employing and relying on the concepts we use for describing and explaining human actions and behaviors, and these concepts just cannot be massaged in a way that would allow them to be put together in a way that would count as a natural science. The ideal has teeth, and so far, at least, it excludes also some other areas of study that might appear to be candidates for a natural science. Chomsky's computational science of language, at least in its pre sent form, does approxima te the ideal of a natural science. This vindicates Chomsky's reliance on rationalist assumptions (internalist and nativist) for the naturalistic study of mind that apply in any case to vision and some other mental systems. It is importa nt in this respect to keep in mind that Chomsky's computational science of language is not computat ional in the way understood by Fodor , Rey, and many other philosophers and psychologists: Chomsky's computational science's focus is entirely on the operations of a system in the head, not on any relations to the world that might be induce d by a person who happens to use the mental resources of fered by language to refer to something ‘out there’, in all like lihood to solve – or try to solve – a practical, interest-involving problem. No tes 1 Given this, it should be no surprise that the commonsense concept of a person allows for Cartesian substance dualism, perhaps even invites it. 2 These Aristotelian insights were adapted to contemporary understandings of mind and meaning in the work of Julius Moravcsik (1975, 1990, 1998). His work was in turn used as the basis for a general account of lexical meanings by James Pus tejovsky (1995). 5 The Scien ce o f Lan guage Where to find a science of language: sy ntax , semantics, and pragmatics I'll begin the explicit discussion of language as understood by the natural scientist by introducing and exp laining a distinction that has been in place for over a centu ry. Its usual contemporary form is based on the work of Charles Morris in a contribution (1938) to what Morris thought of as a theory o f signs. The distinction outlines three ways to look at languages or some other form of symbol system, such as a formal logic or a scientific theory . In effect, he claimed that one can see and study any such symbol system in terms of its syntax, semantics, or pragmatics. 1 Think of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics as ways of classifying and studying the words and other units of a language or symbol system. Syntax is the study of a language's or symbol system's variou s intrinsic features – features that the symbols, words, or lexical items themselves have, without consideration of anything but them alone. If, for example, you ask about a natural langu age's sentences' intrinsic structure – for example, the structure of its sentences or phrases, such as whether sentence word order is subject–verb–object (SVO) or verb–subject–object (VSO) – you are asking a question about the syntax of that langu age/system. Categories of phrases and lexical items or words are also thought to be syntactic categories: noun ph rase, verb phrase, prepositio nal phrase, determiner phrase (a phrase with a determiner “head,” such as the, a , many , few, thr ee, no , etc.). When it comes to categories of lexical items, however , such as noun, verb, adjective, there is dispute. Some – not Chom sky – have thought that these categories are semantic (on which, below), n ot syntactic, or that they at least depend on the kinds of entities, states, o r events to which individual words are thought to refer . Consider the sentence Colorless gr een ideas sleep furiously . Among the syntactic proper ties of this sentence is the fact that it has five words (some with affixes, such as the ‘less’ in colorless ), a noun (ideas ), an adjective (gr een ), at least two phrases (noun and verb phrases), and several other properties. These units and structures will become clearer as discussion proceeds. Semantics is typically seen as the study of the relationship between syntactic items and the world – or perhaps some domain of objects, states of affairs, facts, etc. Refer ence is usually thought to be a paradigm semantic relationship: for the semanticist, the noun dog is said to refer to the class of dogs, the verb give is said to refer to a triadic relational property that takes three ‘arguments’, or things which ‘satisfy’ the relationship, and the like. Some people do not like to talk of reference to properties or expression of properties (which can be seen as a variety of reference), rather than of the things that have properties. They think that would commit them to saying that prop erties exist, and substitute for the referent of give something like sets of things that stand to each other in a giving relationship, or perhaps something even more radical that does without classes too. For our purposes, we can ignore that issue, or supposed issue.2 Another paradigmatic semantic relationship is found in a specific view of truth: truth as a sentence ‘corresponding’ with or ‘fitting’ a fact or state of affairs. This, like reference, is a much-discussed and much-criticized relation. Perhaps both are artifacts of a way of looking at language that has no grounding in the natu ral science of language. Perhaps semantics is a misconceived field of study, at least if semantics is construed as the topic of a natural science, or a branch of one. Chomsky seems to think so, as the next paragraphs suggest. He seems to think that semantics is actually a pragmatic relation. But what is that, and if he is right, why cannot a pragmatic relationship be the topic of a naturalistic form of study? Where syntax studies the intri nsic properties of signs, and semantics studies a class of binary 3 relations between syntactic items such as words and sent ences an d things or states of affairs ‘out there’, pragm atics puts at least one more item into the hopper: the person who uses the syntactic object to do something, sometimes in speech, sometimes in thought. I say “at least one more” because on ce you include a person who uses a word such as “Weeble” to refer to a specific variety of child's toy , you are very likely to be com mitted to also taking into account time of spee ch/thought, circumstances o f speech/though t, speaker/thinker intentions (and those of discourse partn ers, if any), and many other factors too. As Chomsky pointed out in a speech at Harvard in 2007, recalling a point made by Peter F. Strawson (1950), you are very likely going to have to also toss into the hopper something like “object(s ) of current interest,” which you will not be able to specify unless and until you have a full account of the discussion, and perhaps you can manage that only if you happen to be a participant, if then. Yo u might think that you could capture all the factors involved in a person ‘doing something’ with speech or thought, categorize and grade all these factors on some scale or scales, and then of fer a semantic-pragmatic science that would have a full specification in a set of ‘indices’ that assign ‘values’ (things , times, persons …) to all contextual factors that have or could have effects on discourse and thought, and present your new science to an anxiously waiting audience of philosophers, psychologists, workers in AI, and so on. There would be no simplicity in such an o ffering, the indexing of speaker intentions and ‘objects of current interest’ and the like looks worrisome ly difficult, objectivity looks out of reach, formalism looks clumsy and ad hoc, it will be impossible to eliminate action concepts such as belief and desire, and so on. But you can try. In fact, it is quite a popular exercise. But the prospects of producing a science are not high, as anyone taking the CALU observations into account would guess. Reflecting on these kinds of study, it is easy to come up with the field that is most likely to be amenable to being studied by using the methodological tools of natural science, which demand objectivity , universality , formal statement, and so on. Syntax is the obvious choice, as one would expect. It minimizes the subject matter – although, as we will see, the restriction does not exclude an account of word and sentence (intrinsic) meaning, of (intrinsic) sound (phonology), of how words are ‘put together ’ (morphology), and other topics that can be dealt with by focusing on what is in a system or systems in the head alone. And it is amenable to internalist and nativist demands, so long as structural and ‘word’ (lexical item) features can be seen to ‘grow’ automatically and be located in the head. It is no surprise that Chomsky's science of language is a study of the syntactic structure of natural languages, of what they are, of how they evolved, and of how we humans ‘grow’ a specific form of a natural language that Chomsky calls an “I-language.” You can exclude pragmatics as understood above as apt fo r natural science methodology . Perhaps you will be able to find some regular patterns exhibited in discourse, and might even be able to find some that can be investigated by a science that is able to say why these patterns appear . Some of Grice's work (1975, 19 81), with follow-up work by investigators such as Sperber and Wilson (1986) and several others, appears to exhibit this property . But for reasons that go back to the CALU observations and are illustrated above, you will not be able to construct a scientific study that can take into accoun t all the specific details of specific discourses and thoughts at specific times. These do not and cannot constitute a faculty, which is a relatively closed domain, grounded in nature. They are rather factors that play roles in problem-solving: commonsense understanding. As for semantics, if it were possible to restrict the study of semantics to the study of relations between (say) words and things (reference) and sentences and states of affairs (truth), it might at least appear to be possible to construct a science of semantics. Chomsky's view on this, however , is clear: you cannot make sense of the crucial relationship of reference which supposedly ties a word to a thing or class without taking into account that it is pe ople who refer. If that is the case – and it certainly seems plausible, given the CALU observations and reflection on one's own efforts, among other things – the natural science of language can be restricted to the study of syntax. Essentially , that is the study of native I-languages inside the head, or what can also be called the study of grammar . It is important to keep in mind, however , that Chomsky has rather a broad notion of syntax, one that includes a science of (linguistic) sound and a science of (natural language expressed) meanings and – in the widest possible notion of syntax – any natural science of the mind/brain that counts or could count as a natural science of the mind. That automatically makes any inte rnalist and nativist mental natural science a candidate. Some internalist form of mind/brain study might fail to be a natural science for other reasons, but it at least proceeds with the right assumptio ns. For our purposes, it is en ough to note that virtually everything that one might want to include in a science of language, including a science of meaning, gets included in syntax – so long, at least, as the relevant scienc es meet the relevant conditio ns. You could even have an internalist “semantic theory” if you wanted, if you made out the ‘objects’ to which your expressions ‘referred’ to be stipulated mental objects, perhaps ‘entit ies’ in a mental model o f some sort. Chomsky suggests as much (1986, 2000). But do not think that this counts as a theory of reference in the usual sense, where there is reference by someone to something outside the head with the hope and often expectation that an audience will recognize to what one is referring. Comparison to Frege To see what Chomsky is up to in his discussion of semantics, it can help to compare what he aims to do with the relationship of reference to the work of Gottlob Frege in his “On Sense and Reference.” This co mparison is useful because Frege's work on a semantics for invented symbol systems like those found in advanced mathematics heavily influenced many twentieth-century philosophers who wanted to construct a semantic theory for natural languages. Frege's contributions to formal systems and a semantics for mathematics are unquestionably important. But extending his efforts with mathematics to natural languages is another matter . Frege (1952: 3 8) argued that in a specific community of speakers whose speech o r symbol use meets his r equir ements on a pr operly functioning ‘language’ or system of symbols , a word or referring phrase would be regularly associated with a specific sense or ‘way of presenting’ (conceiving) an object, and any specific sense would in turn determine a specific referent . In a famous example, he noted that while “the morning star” and “the evening star” bot h referred to Venus (which is not a star, of course), the two terms' ways of presenting or conceiving of Venus – their senses – differed. Generally , on his way of looking at reference, there are three ‘entities’ (words, senses, and referents), two two-term relations (between word and sense, and between sense and referent), and one three- term relationship (referring or denoting). But in fact, if one takes into account what he assumes (italicized above), his tale is much more contentious. For by assuming a community of individuals who all use language in accord with a specific set of requirements on use, he also included the speakers of the language/symbol system and a normative condition on how these speaker s/users must use the relevant symbols. One can study symbol systems that are so constrained. But whether one can construct a natural science of them is another matter . Frege in other writings acknowledged that ordinary speakers speaking natural languages do not meet this normative condition. However , communities of mathematicians doing mathematics (the area Frege was primarily interested in) come close to meeting it. Thus, we can say that the conditions he insisted on are not far of f the mark for the ways this domain of users while doing mathematics use their symbols – keepin g in mind, however , that even where speak ers/users do respect the relevant conditions, reference is nevertheless reference by people. Thus, a Fregean picture of semantics work s only where speakers/users deliberately co nstrain and thereby regiment the ways they associate their symbols with specific senses, and denote or refer to a specifi ed thing or class of things, given a sense. Assuming regimentation in association and application, 0 or aleph-null does appear to refer all by itself, whether for a Russian or an Israeli mathematician. But the fact remains: the mathematician, not the symbol, refers and maintains regularities in doing so. Looking at it in this way, we can also plausibly say that scientist s working within a specific theory come close to meeting the requirements of a Fregean semantics. They too aim to avoid ambiguity and ensure that everyone in the community understands an invented theory and its symbols in the same way. Chomsky hints at this point in (1996: ch. 2). The demand that they do so is in a way imposed by the natures of their enterprise. But their enterprise and its success ultimately depends, of course, on their participating in it. A related fact about the cases where a Fregean semantics seems to work – that is, mathematics and the natural sciences – is that in these domains of human concern, the concepts and usually the symbols employed to express those concepts are human inventions, unlike the concepts and sounds found in natural languages. Recalling a theme discussed above, Chomsky makes the poin t in (2000) by pointing out to philosophers that a ‘sentence’ that they ofte n tout as indicating that “water” refers to H2 O, “Water is H2 O,” is neither a sentence of English n or a well-formed expression of molecular chemistry. It is n either because, in part, the sound “water” and the concept WATER are innate in the specified way (although their association is not) while “H2 O” and the relevant concepts fo und in molecular chemistry (and related n atural sciences) are the inventions of scientists, and neither innate nor resident within the same con ceptual framework. The symbo l systems of the natu ral sciences and of mathematics, or at least advanced mathematics, need to be learned. They do not come naturally .4 They contribute to a different human enterprise: constructing natural sciences. I emphasize: by ignoring the fact that regimentation of use by people and a human-created symbol system too is involved, while it might seem that the symbols 3 2 and 81 , having different senses, by themselves refer to or denote the same ‘thing’, 9, they do not. They do not any more than “water” by itself refers to water. That natural language terms and theoretical symbols refer ‘by themselves’ is a view that many still hold. “Water” (the sound alone?) is sometimes claimed to stand in some kind of ‘rigid’ relationship to cases of water, independently of a specific speaker . And “H2 O” refers to – well – H2 O. Neither is correct. People using natural languages refer with the understandings of terms built into their native concepts, and when they do hap pen to refer with “water”, they refer, an d as indicated above, only to water (as flexibly understood in some commonsense problem-solving enterprise, even if it happens to be in a scientist's lab). When the scien tist uses “H2 O” to refer to some science- specific substance, it is he or she who refers to that substance as understood in the relevant science. People refer , using the concepts that they have. As for Chomsk y's view of app lying a Fregean picture of semantics to natural languages: it is predictable (for confirmation, see Chomsky's discussion of Fregean ‘langua ges’ in (1996: ch. 2)). The sounds and concepts of natural languages are innate. And the use of natural language is not regimented. Fregean semantics, and the variants on it that were introduced after Frege to attempt to use a Fregean semantics for the study of natural languages, just do not apply to natural languages, or to their use. This do es not mean that one cannot construct a science of natural language, even a science of natural language meanings and thus in a very different way, a semantic theory . But any such effort must be a science that is in a broad sense syntactic, through and through. Such a scien ce does not include a theory of reference or denotation in Frege's three-term or the popular two-term sense. Reference is not lodged in nature and there is no natural science of it. It is so mething that people do and, with native resources available, that they do freely and sometimes in playful and poetic ways. To emphasize the differences between Chomsky's project and Frege's, notice that Chomsky's science of language has nothing to do with what Frege thought of as symbols and words. Frege's words and symbols are external entities , perhaps marks on a page having some kind o f design or sounds individuated in some unknown fashion. Chomsky's ‘words’ or lexical items (LIs) are inside the head in a mental dictionary . And while Chomsky ackno wledges a relationship between LI sounds (p honological features) and meanings or sense s (an LI's semantic features), and grants that this relationship is normative in the sense that speakers who wish to communicate should associate LI ‘sounds’ and ‘meanings’ in the way others in a community do, this association is – again – not som ething that one can or needs to deal with in a science of language where the target is providing the descriptive and explanatory tools for dealing with any I- language. Chomsky's naturalistic science of natural languages includes only studies of linguistic phenomena that display POS observations: linguistic sounds (phono logy-phonetics), linguistic structures (morphol ogy and narrow syntax) , and linguistically expressed concepts/meanings. The association between sound and sense found in LIs in peop le's mental dictionaries may be important for purposes of communication and thus for languages and symbol systems as Frege understood them, but it is irrelevant for Cho msky's efforts at constructing a natural science of language and linguistic sounds and meanings. Nevertheless, there is one suggestive analogy . It is found in an aspect of Chomsky's ling uistically expre ssed concepts. These are analogues to Frege's senses in that they are universal and objective. But they are neither universal nor objective in the manner Frege thought they must be. Frege's senses are abstract entities, so their universality and ‘objectivity’ are based on no facts about nature, only on Frege's claim to an elevated status as abstract entities in some Platonic world of abstract entities. Chomsky's senses o r clusters of semantic features are universal because the features themselves and the ways they cluster upon acquisition are based on facts about the human mind and ho w it acquires the commonsense concepts expressed in natural languages. Thus – and very much not as for Frege, who saw psy chology as essentially individualistic – linguistically expressed concepts are psychological not ions, but not for that reason in any way private. Language as formal function Chomsky defines languages as formal functions. That is not all, but it is a major part of what is involved . Before saying how Chomsky defines a natural languag e as a formal function, let us look briefly at a popular attempt to adapt Frege's picture of semantics (actually, a normatively governed form of pragmatics) to language – to the commonsense conception of language-as-used . Found in the work of David Lewis and Wilfrid Sellars, and that of many others, the aim is to try to find “rules of use” in natural languages and turn these into formal functions. This failed attempt of fers an important lesson: do not try to adapt co mmonsense understanding's view of language-as-used to the methods of natural science. Language as formal function: the wrong approach I have emphasi zed that most philosophers and psychologists , and even many lin guists, are attracted to the commonsense view of language. The commonsense view of language portrays language as a learned public practice or set of conventions, thereby focusing on the use to which a set of signs or symbols is put. The signs or symbols are portrayed not as lexical items in the head amounting to complexes of phonological and semantic features, but as marks on a page (orthographic items) or sounds characterized in some way that allows them to be “public” and o ut there for anyone with normal hearing in range, presumably in the way colors and shapes are ‘out there’ for commonsense understanding (although not for the natural science of color vision). In some Frege-style accounts of the meanings of these symbols, including sophisticated-looking varieties of possible-world acc ounts, the meaning or sense of a mark or sound is sometimes claimed (for example, by David Lewis) to be a function that takes symbols from a domain of symbols and yields various kinds of things in the range of the function. No uns yield a thing or class of things, verbs classes or sets of classes of things, sentences states of affairs or – as with Frege and those who followed him – perhaps truth values. Tho se who defend this kind of approach hope that the function involved can be construed as sufficiently like a determinate form al one that it can be seen as yielding a unique item in its range for every word in its domain. In effect, Frege's senses are construed as formal functions from symbols to denotata or referent s. The senses are the functions themselves. You can think of them as the ‘uses’ of the words (seen perhaps as marks on a page). To underscore the last remark above: there is also a “conceptual role” account of the meanings (senses or modes of presentation) of symbols that differs p rimarily in emphases alone. In this account, the meanings of expressions are said to be captu red by appeal to the uses to which nouns, verbs, adjectives, and sentences are put in a (uniform) “langua ge game” – their functions or roles in a language game that respects rules of usage that effectively has its players refer with nouns, say things that are true with sentences, etc. Here, “function” appears to mean something like “what the word does in usage.” It might appear to be divorced from the notion of a determinate formal function because it seems to leave room for emphasizing the role of a speak er and context. But given the intents of the defenders of the account – to construct a theory and not just describe use and meaning, and by this means , define a language as a determinate form of practice – that is not the case. Lewis's “Languages and Language” (1975) argues for the fundamental unity of the two approaches. To illustrate his point, note that those such as Sellars drawn to the conceptual role account see an analogy between a (natural) language game and a strict rule-governed form of activity, chess. The analogy is instructive. Instead of written and spoken symbols, chess has pieces, and their roles (their “co nceptual roles”) are defined by the rules of chess, which stipulate how pieces can be moved. Pursuing the analogy , words are said to ‘move’ according to rules. In the case of language, the rules are not stated, but conceptual role defenders assume that they are honored in the linguistic behaviors of members of a linguistic community . In effect, defenders assume the rules are induced in the behaviors of members of a linguistic community by some kind of training or learning procedure (behaviorist training is a popular one) that p rovides for uniformity or regimentation in the ways individuals use the terms they have available to ‘play the games of language’. Words such as “red” (a perception word) are introduce d to a sentence/discourse as a result of sensation (through “language entry rules”). Action words lead to behavior (“move finger”). “Language exit rules” are said to govern them. Words induced by entry rules and exit rules, along with others, are p ut together (via ‘syn tactic’ rules) in various kinds of sentences, and these sentences are governed by language-internal inference rules based on truth or correctness assessments. (If X can correctly say “there is smoke,” X is entitled to or can correctly say “there is fire.”) In the last case, it is assumed that the rules – both log ical inferential rules and “mat erial” rules that govern inferences from sen tences that state facts of the matter to other sentences that state facts of the matter – are corre ct. They are thought to be so because if honored without success, they will extinguish; otherwise, they are correct. It should be no surprise that those who like this approach – and the formal function story too – are drawn to the idea that a language is rather like a “theory of the [commonsense] world.” The obv ious pro blem for Lewis and Sellars and others who like to think that it is possibl e to construct a theory of language-as-used is that if they really think they can treat their functions from words to things and circumstances (direct and indirect) in the way the natural scientist treats functions (essentially , as laws), they better hope to find sufficient uniformity and conformity in use in populations of speakers to underwrite such a move. It is a mug's game. They assume (in accord with commonsense's conception of language but without warrant) that there must be training procedures or like procedures that ensure conform ity in use. And on the parts of speakers, they assume (again without warrant) uniformity in intention: they assume that people are truth-tellers, with no long-term incentive to break a truth-telling game's rules – or , more important for our purposes, be creative in their use of language. The strategy is popular . But it is broken-backed. With the uninteresting exception of the association of specific sounds with (more or less) specific concepts in a population of (say) Swahili (or Bantu, or English …) speakers, it is very difficult to find anything in the use of natura l languages that really looks like a settled usage-related linguistic convention or practice of the sort they need, where a specific word or sentence maps determinately onto a thing, property , or situation, even in truth-telling contexts. Recall the example I of fered before of many witnesses to a crash, where even in the truth-telling con text of a court of law, each describes the event in a different way. Sellars speaks of “practices” of people in a population, Lewis of “conventions.” But it is very difficult to find any even ap proximately determinate prac tices or conventions in use. Take greeting another person: people may greet each other with a “hello,” but also with a “hi,” a “howdy ,” a “hey there,” a “yo,” a “what's up” (“whazzup”), or currently in some groups, a “dude.” Even in the limiting case where a population is restricted to a sing le individual, there are no determinate practices or con ventions of the sort that Sellars and Lewis (and their many followers) need. There is no blo ck to treating a language-at-a-time (an I-langu age) as a formal function. But by now it should be obvious that if you think of language in the way the commo nsense conception of language invites you to, as a regulated form of behavior , you will not succeed. So we must abandon the focus on use and lo ok to an internal native system that allows for creative use. Language as formal function: the right approach If focusing on use to get a science of language leads to a dead end, how must on e concei ve a language, o r language? There is a good natural science way to describe language, and also a way to describe a language. I start with describing/defining a language, or an I-language. Assume that language should be seen as a generative system, specifically , one that with finite means determines an unlimited number of sentential expressions. The term “generative” has come to mean two things in linguistics. One is due to the mathematical-formal nature of the science of language: a generative principle is one that is explicitly and formally defined. Another is due to the fact that the relevant generative principles must yield a potential infinity of expressions, for natural languages are systems that provide – in principle – for an unbounded number o f sentences or expre ssions. That is why “generative” has also come to mean something like “productive.” Anyone familiar with elementa ry mathematics knows that to go from finite means (some lexical items and some generative principles or ‘laws’) to in finite potential output of discrete elements (here, sentence s that differ in theor y-relevant ways) is to ensure that one or more of the generative principles provid es recursion. A simple example of a recursive principle is the successor function. It generates and defines the natural number series. Avoiding formal ism, the function says that if you begin the series of natural numbers with 1, to get the rest you need only at each step add 1: 1  + 1 gives you two; (1  +  1)  +  1 gives you three, and so on. 5 A language must have principles that, like the successor function, yield boundless ranges (outputs) with fin ite domains (input elements), with each item in the range (sentences) discernibly distinct from every other . The natural n umbers and languages constitute “discrete infinities”: infinite items in their ranges, where each such item is discerni bly distinct from any other . We will see in a moment what provides recursion of the relevant sort in Chomsky's recent work. Assuming this, here is how to describe a language: a language is a formally stated function from lexical items to expressions, where expressions are seen as structured forms of semantic and phonetic information – informally , meaning and sound ‘information’, where these are taken to be kinds of ‘information’ made available to other systems in the head, inf ormation that the other systems can utilize. For such a definition to meet the standards of natural science, “function” is to be read as “formal function,” where the function is stated in formal and explicit terms in the relevant naturali stic theory of the language faculty. Given this, a language – specifically , an I-language – is defined when you provide a list of the lexical items in a person's mental dictionary plus the combinatory principles, ‘laws’, o r algorithms that provide ways to combine lexical items to yield expressions. The list of lexical items with the various features that each has is what makes the language an individual one. The lexical items-plus-laws specification is an internal speci fication of a language: it describes what can be thought of as a computational system in the head. And the combinatory principles (since they can in principle yield an unbounded set of expressions including many that cannot be used) are intensionally specified. This specification yields an I-language that is individual, internal, and intensional. It formally specifie s what is intended when one speaks of a language as a way of yielding an infinity , given finite means. What are the combinatory principles? As Chomsky's theories have progressed, there have been various answers that have been related to each other , each simpler and more comprehensive than the last. The most recent is the simplest. Some qualificati ons aside, it amounts to the function Merge, which has two prominent forms. The most obvious and easily illustrated form of Merge amounts to something like “put lexical items together” or “concatenate” them. In that form, called “External Mer ge,” Merge takes two lexical items and makes of them the set of the two, which is then a more complex lexical item or “syntactic object.” To illustrate: given the lexical items (LIs) “eat” and “apple” External Merge makes the set {eat, apple}, which amounts in this case to a verb phrase. In general, External Merge takes item X and item Y and yields the set {X, Y}. Another form of Merge is called “Internal Merge.” It consists of taking something that has already been merged into a syntactic object and re- merging it, essentially placing it ‘outside’ the constructed entity , or ‘at the edge’. So assume that we begin with a complex syntactic object Y that contains an X: Y = […X…]. Now take the X inside Y and merge it with Y itself; you get {X, Y}, where Y contains X. Thus, Internal Merge (X, Y) where X is inside Y  =  {X, Y}  =  {X, […X…]} (see C&M: 16, 238). For example, suppose at a stage of a derivation or computation the language system has External Merged “what” and “eat,” so that you get the syntactic object {eat, what} – in effect, a verb phrase. Then you External Merge again to this “John,” and you get {John, {eat, what}}. Next, you apply Internal Merge, which gives you {what, {John, {eat, what}}} – in effect, a question, where the “what” inside the first-Merged {eat, what} is not pronounced, even though the mind understands it as the object of the verb “eat” (that is, as what gets eaten). There are additional complications, but for current purposes, we can ignore them. Internal Merge replaces what Chomsky up until around 2000 used to think of as a separa te principle, Move, which amounts to a “transformation” (hence the early terminology: “transf ormational- generative grammar”). Some examples of earlier grammars taken from various stages of Chomsky's work appear below; they illustrate the point. Transformations on the recent view, unlike the earlier ones, do not require a separate principle. They are just variants of Merge where X is not distinct from Y, as it is in Externa l Merge. Note that the Inte rnal Merge ‘transformation’ illustrated above leaves a “copy” of X in its original position, where it is understood by the mind to be: an object of a verb in a verb phrase. In earlier grammars, Chomsky introduced what he called “traces” that did the job that copies now do: they indicate the place from which a lexical item or LI mov ed, and the place where it is understood to be. Copies (and traces) are not pronounced, although they remain in the semantic or meaning derivation and are found at the semantic interface to other mental systems. Chomsky has suggested that Merge alone (in its various forms) might suffice as the sole combinatory principle on the path to the semantic interface (C&M: 54–6). Separate and still-unclear principles would be needed on the path towards the phonetic interface between language and perceptual and articulatory systems. Given his desire to simplify the definition of language as much as possible in order to – among other things – make it possible to speak to how language might have been introduced to the species as a result of a single mutation, he focuses primarily on the path where Merge alone operates. The reasoning behind that view reflects the desire of the natural scientist to seek simplicity – with, in this case, a very tempting-looking hypothesis as the result. That hypothesis is that a single mutation – the introduction of Merge in an individual – led to the very useful capacity to engage in complex thoughts, even if this capacity preceded the later capacity to express these thoughts. While I began by saying how to define a lang uage – an I-language – my explanation has ended by explai ning what language is. That sho uld not be a surprise, for to investigate scientifically and say what a langu age is, you really need to know what any language is – that is, be able to say what any (I-)language is. You can conceive of that project as an attempt to construct a complete theory . A complete theory can be conceived of in at least two ways – both out of reach at the moment, including one that is likely to be out of reach of human intelligence forever . Complete theories? The task of co nstructing a complete theory could be seen as one that provides a theory that captures the internal natures and developmental courses of all the mental systems involved in what Chomsky along with Hauser and Fitch in their 2002 Science article (Hauser et al. 2002) called the “FLB,” or “faculty of language, broad.” That would include a theory not only of what they call the “FLN” or “faculty of language, narrow” (in essence, an I-language) but of all the other systems involved in the perception, articulation, and production of speech and though t, plus their interactions. Since that would also require a theory of the systems' various interfaces and of the circumstances in which each system communicates with ano ther, when, and how , a theory or theories of this sort wo uld have to provide determinate predictive accounts of thought- and speech-production. We have already seen that that project seems out of reach of the methods of natural science. Some speech- and thought-production can be captured by commonsense understanding's notion of rational causation. But that is not science. The more nearly realizable form of a complete natural scientific theory of language would be one that focused on the FLN alone, and thus not only on the combinatory system of language – including that pathway that goes towards the phonetic interface – but also on the innate system or systems that provide the commonsense concepts and phonological/phonetic features that com e to be associated in lexical items. The specific associations found in so me speech community – or individual, for that matter – are irrelevant to the natural scientist; as mentioned. That is a matter of “Saussurean arbitrariness,” mere association. No specific pairing is sanctioned by nature, only the system or systems that yield the relevant linguistically expressed concepts and sounds, each captured in groups of features that can have effect at the relevant interfaces. With theories of such systems in place (including accounts of the growth or development of the system(s)), we could say what any possible commonsense concept is, what any linguistically expressed “sound” could be, and what the combinatory principles available for any possible I-language might be. We could do this while remaining within the scope of the FLN. Clearly, accom plishing all that would take a lot of work. And on the current view of the task, it would require going outside of the study of language proper and into the study of the chemical, computational, physical, and other constraints on development that play a role in the way in which the FLN develops in an individual. Still, it appears achievable within the scope of nat ural science methodology . And the search will no doubt be interesting. A more modest version of the last project mentioned may be o n the way to achievement. It focuses not o n everything that contributes to the growth of a specific grammar in any given individual, but on what is absolutely essential to have a language at all, and thus on what would have to have been introduced into the human species by some mutation o r series of mutations, where what is introduced is sufficient to explain why we humans alone appear to have a language faculty. This is the route that Chomsky pursues in his recent work within the framework of the “Minimalist Program.” It provides the most nearly achievable internalist linguistic scientific projec t for the momen t, and points clearly towards what is needed in or der to ‘biolo gize’ language, or to accommodate the science of language to that of biology . For informal discussion of this program and its progress, see C&M. The Science article mentioned above outline s much of the basic strategy. Beyond distinguishing the study of FLB from the FLN, that article aims at finding some feature of langu age that cannot be found in the mental repertoires of any other creature, whether in homologues (very unlikely in the case of langu age) or analogues. The argument proceeds by focusing the search o n whatever it is that yields what has long been seen as a distinctly human capacity , the capacity to produce discrete infinities, whether they appear as distinct sentences/expressions or as natural numbers. As we have seen, that can be understood as a search for Merge in other creatures' cognitive/mental capacities. The authors conclude that while there may be some non-lingu istic capacity such as navigation that uses recursion, they can find nothing so far that does what Merge does by way of providing multitudes of complex forms of ‘information’ 6 at meaning and sound interfaces. In no other cases is there evidence of the kind of productivity that leads to a p otential discrete infinity of expressions that is found with human languages. Notice what this approach to producing a complete theory assumes. First, it assumes that human conceptual capacities as well as sound-production and sound-perception capacities are in place when Merge is introdu ced, at least to a degree. Perhaps that commitm ent can be reduced further, though – as suggested above. It is probably enough to have human conceptual systems in place, even if relatively few concepts have formed. Even a few concepts would still allow Merge to yield a discrete infinity of complex thoughts, and these thoughts could provide enough of an advantage to those who had Merge to allow Merge to remain in place in the progeny of the man or woman in whom the relevant mutation took place. In such a case, thoughts could not be expressed. Nor co uld one be conscious of one's thoughts, fo r even when we just talk to o urselves in thinking, planning, ruminating, etc. we employ the sound systems, although without speaking out loud. While we need to assume that concepts are in place for this minimizing strategy to succeed, we do not need to assume that human linguistically expressed conce pts available at the time of evolution and the range of possible linguistic sounds/signs are shared with other creatures. Deciding whether they are or not would require good theories of the relevant systems that yield concepts and linguistically expressed sounds and then comparison with oth er creatures – and, of course, evidence which as it stands would be extremely difficult to find, if for no other reason than that the theories are in a pri mitive state, at best. Prima facie, however , there is no parti cular reason to think at the moment that they are shared, especially concepts. Do apes have or even need the concept RIFT or LEDGE, for example, not to mention THIRTY-THREE? Is an ape's concept of ape faces – assuming there is such, an d judging on the basis of some degree of similarity in the behaviors of humans and som e specific ape species – not just like the human concept FACE in some respects, but the same? Is it related through relevant semanti c features to SURFACE? Does it lend itself to treatment as a verb (including FACING) or noun? As for sounds: do parrots quickly and early in life com e to hear one of the various human linguistic sound ranges as that of a specific human “mother tongue”? Are their native sounds and gestures like those of the developing infant who becomes familiar with a language's soun ds virtually instantaneously , and while developing the capacity to articulate sounds/sig ns moves through a predictable course of babbling (in sound and sign) and beyond? And so on. These considerations and others make an identity of human conceptual and spee ch/sign capacities with those of some other or ganism very dubious. There might be similarities in displayed behaviors, of course. Trained apes have been shown to be capable of some sign/symbol use – although without the recognition of structure and morphological alternatives (TYPE, TYPING, TYPEWRITER …) that comes automatically to children. Apes have also been trained to behave in ways that are somewhat similar to how humans do when they employ concepts such as FOOD and HUNGRY in primitive action contexts. Further, neural work on primates by Rizzolatti and his associat es (Rizzolatti and Craighero 2004) indicates that primates seem to have concepts that are structurally rather like the human GIVE and are employed both in receivin g and in giving with others of the same species. But none of this is evidence of identity . There is no reason to doubt that apes, for example, can produce sounds of a not very articulate sort and gestures and hand articulations o f various sorts. Nor is there reason to doubt that they have concepts of some sort. But – focusing now on concepts – from what little we know of them, their concepts are closely tied to behavior and limited in scope, with little if any flexibility, with respect either to the int roduction of ones to suit new cases and things, or to their application. An d it is very unlikely that they have co ncepts like DEMOCRACY, COMPUTER, AVERAGE, etc. and all but impossible that they have concepts like FIFTY-NINE and ONE FIFTH. To have the last two, they would have to have a recursive system like that found in language (Merge), and the evidence indicates that they do not. The result of p ursuing this minimizing strategy is that unless Merge's development in an individual allows for variant structures – perhaps variants due to the influence of physical, chemical, or co mputational constraints on development – we can plausibly assume that Merge is the same in all human languages. Perhaps we can even take another step characteristic of the Minimalist Program (C&M: 54–6). That step is to see if we can place all linguistic differences on a computational pathway to a phonetic interfa ce, where the language system is forced to ‘linearize’ a sentence's expre ssion and use various devices to – among other things – indicate which nouns are to be read as subjects, which as objects. It is obvious that different languages – including different I-languages for what we would informally call “English speakers,” or even the same speaker – do in fact so und different and linearize their sound signals in different ways, by exploiting different structures. While the claim about identity of computation on the way to a semantic interface for all languages is reasonable, it is speculative. But if it is correct, perhaps with minor exceptions, and if it is plausible that human concepts (or the system(s) that yield them) were in place when Merge was introduced, we co uld say that Merge defines language, at least for the purposes of speaking to what is central to, comm on in, and essential to all human languages. This is all with an eye to saying what needed to be introduced by a mutation to explain why we alone have language and at least primitive forms of science – and natural numbers, plus its of fspring, mathematics. So there we have it: for the science of language as understood from the point of view of the current Min imalist Program, language for Chomsky is (tentatively , and under the relevant assumptions) Merge + concepts, and I- languages are formal functions that take semantic features of LIs (concepts) and com bine them to yield an in-principle unbounded set of thoughts, where these are minimally taken to be sets of semantic features made available at semantic interface s with other systems inside the head. In expanded but still realizable form, LIs are semantic and phonological features and Merge must be supplemented with other principles. However construed, the science is internalist and naturalistic, computational in form. Language as the majority of philosophers and psychologists understand it, or language externalized (E-language, as Chomsky sometimes puts it), becomes an epiphenomenon. It is not something that can be carefully and precisely characterized and it is not an apt subject matter for the methods of natural science. In terms that so me philosophers are fond of using, it is the appearance, and not the reality . Progress in linguistics The account of the science of language outlined above represents the most recent version of Chomsky's efforts. There were several earlier efforts to construct natura listic sciences of language. Aspects of them survive in the most recent version, but that version is a clear advance towards better satisfying the methodological demands on natural science research: simplicity , expla natory and descriptive adequacy , objectivity , universality , accommodation with biology , and so on. I outline some of the earlier attempts here to indicate the degree of progress that has been made in the last 60 years or so of work on transformational-generative grammars in the Chomskyan mode. Grammars are formal theories of languages. A grammar is transformational if it relies at least in part on a way to specify where and how in the computation of a sen tence or expression, elements of a language (lexical items in a technical sense) can be moved, or perhaps copied, to different positions, ending up in a different position than the one it is interpreted as being in. Transfor mations are needed because – among other things – they explain why lexical items in one position in a sentence are interpreted as being in another position. Everyone interprets the sentence The dog that ate the rat that ate the cheese that sat in the r efrig erator … is ill in such a way that the dog is taken to be the subject of the verb phrase is ill and is understo od as though it were proximal to the verb phrase is ill, even though it appears to ears and eyes to be displaced across several intermediate clauses – in principle, indefinitely many more than appear here. This feature of natura l languages – Chomsky calls it the “displacement property” – was in his early grammars explained by appealing to “movement transformations,” where these consist of formally stated rules that sanction going from one formally defined position (“phrase structure”) in a linguistic computation/derivation to another such position, also for mally defined. His 1955 Logical Structur e of Linguistic Theory (LSLT) introduced transformational rules that resembled but made important changes in some statements of relations between structures explored by his University of Pennsylvania linguistics instructor Zellig Harris. Because LSLT was not p ublished until much later (1975), though, it was his 1957 Syntactic Structur es that introduced transformations and transformational grammars to a wider audience. His early views of transformations have under gone several important changes that need not concern us here. The important issue for our purposes is “why transformations?” That is, why should we introduce transformational grammars, where from at least some points of view there are much simpler grammars available that do not have them? We can look at the matter this way: it is clear that for languages to exist at all, there must be a means of concatenating o r joining lexical items to create more complex sentential structures. Every language concatenates or relies on External Merge; why should there be movement, or something like it – copying? And in trying to answer that question, we shoul d also keep in the back of our minds the question of what it is in natur e that demands movement of items – if, indeed, it does. Syntactic Structur es is a good place to begin to get insight into these matters. The volume amounts largely to Chomsky's notes for a class at MIT in the 19 50s. Fo rmal linguistics of the sort that Chomsky invented was very new at the time (only a few had access to copies of LSLT) and were so different from what had been done before that Chomsky needed to explain to his class in elementary terms how his approach differed, and why he used the spec ific mathematical and formal tools he did in the way he did in order to understand a phenomenon – natural language – that was thought by many of his students to be easy to deal with by using the tools of information theory that had just been in troduced. Grammars must allow for the production of an infinite number of sentences of arbitrary leng th, but also determinate structure. Information theory as then understood provided finite state grammars – on the face of it, the simplest (by one standard ) that allow for the generation of sentences o f indefinite length, thereby providing for an infinite number . But these grammars are hopeless. A finite state grammar construc ts a sentence in the way Alan Turing in the 1930s pointed out a computing machine as defined by him could. Beginning with an initial state (a single lexical item), the machine moves to another state by adding (essentially , concatenating) another lexical item, proceeding thereafter to a final state – effectively, placing a period. There is neither look-forw ard nor look-back. One form of finite state grammar is a stochastic and probabilistic Markovian one. The ‘decision’ on which item to place after a given item is no t completely determined, but is based on probabilistic gro unds. The machine follows rules, and these rules ‘say’ that after placing the, the machine can place another item on the basis of the probability that that item follows the the. No verb or adverb can, but any of a group of nouns could follow the, nouns such as house , stable , winch , etc. What about rumrunner and r esour cefulness ? These are just less probable, where p robability is measured, presumably , by frequency of that sequence in a corpus or population, thus indicating an externalist and empiricist assumption behind this approach. How about the sequence Colorless gr een ideas sleep furiously ? So long as the probability of each element following the othe r at least makes this sequence considerably more pr obable than Gr een sleep colorless furiously ideas , there is a probabilistic (but no yes-no) means of distinguishing between the grammatical and non-grammatical or garbage cases. On inspection, serious problems emerge. How many pairwise lexical probability rules are needed: given a specific item, what can follow it? Since grammars of this sort do not – despite my use of the words ‘noun’, ‘verb’, and ‘adverb’ above – p rovide for categories of lexical item, there must be a massive number of them. Worse, given the anti-nativist assumptions of such grammars, each such rule will have to be learned. There are other problems too. The rules do not even work for the logician's predicate calculus, which has nested dependencies (quantifiers that bind embedded variables, for example). 7 Generally , long-range dependencies such as that mentioned earlier pose serious difficulties for a finite state grammar. Const ructing or reading the sentence above from left to right without representing the distant connection between dog and is ill looks hopeless. No finite state grammar can do this. In effect, then, finite state grammars cannot say definitely what gets counted as a sentence of English (or any other na tural language, with whatever variants). And they cannot deal with nested and long-distance dependencies. They are not, then, even marginally descriptively adequa te. As for solving Plato's proble m, or what Chomsky in early work took to be the sole explanatory issue: it is hard to imagine what a finite state theory of all languages (a finite state UG that actually contributes to explaining the POS facts) would look like. So while they are simple in one sense, fin ite state grammars are anything but simple in the sense nee ded to contribute to dealing with acquisition: minimization of the amount that needs to be learned. They fail at meeting even minor standards for descriptive and explanatory adequacy . Chomsky concludes that we need at least a phrase structure grammar to get that; fro m the point of view of acquisition, it is much simpler than a finite state grammar, for it can be compres sed into a set of rewrite rules. And if you add to a phrase structure compo nent a transformational one, you simplify in this respect still further. Syntactic Structur es and the later Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965) of fered those kinds of simpler grammar . Before continui ng, a couple of technical terms and some useful aide- mémoires. One technical term is “base component.” In the so-called “Standard Theory” of 1965's Aspects of the Theory of Syntax , it was assumed that there is a transfo rmational component of a grammar whose job it is to mo ve elements in structures around. This component was assumed to operate over sentence-like but formally characterized structures produced by the base compon ent. The base component consisted of a lexicon and a (perhaps ordered) group of “rewriting rules,” together constituting a phrase structure component (on which below). The term “base co mponent” remained, at least for a while, even after phrase structure rules disappeared. The second technical term is “Deep Structure.” Deep Structures were in Chomsky's early work structures that consisted of generated base structure components to which obligatory transformations were applied. In (1965), they also constituted the locus of semantic interpretation. Again, the term remained – although sometimes in altered form such as “D-structure” and “DS” – even after a base component as originally understood, obligatory transformations, and interpretation ‘underneath’ as opposed to the ‘surface’ were all abandoned. It did not fully disappear until the advent of the Minimalist Program in the early 1990s. The aide-mémoire consists of simple pictures of the overall structure of Chomsky's evolving views of linguistic computation and interpretation. The capital letters F and Y provide two such simple pictures; another – the purpose of which I will return to – is something like this: . The F approximates the structure of Chomsky's (1965) Standard Theory grammar. The bottom of the F represe nts the operations perfo rmed in the base component with which a derivation begins, including the application of obligatory transformations, yielding Deep Structures – something like simple sentences, but actually formally defined abstract structures. Deep Structures are located at the po int where the bottom right-hand branch of the F begins to branch. The botto m branch represents the operations involved in yielding a semantic interpretation of Deep Structures. It was assumed that the abstract Deep Structures and their semantic in terpretation are universal, the same across all languages. The trunk between the lower and upper branch represents optional transformations that combine and move items in Deep Structures around. They – assuming any are employed – lead to the topmost node, called “Surface Structure.” To these, the phonological-phonetic system applies to yield phonetic interpretations. This picture in its pure form was soon modified in various ways and eventually became the Y for m that characterizes com putation in the Principles and Parameters (P&P) framework that began early in the 1980s. The trunk of the Y represen ts base D-structure operations; the branch node is S-structure (again, a successor term), and the tops of the branches are PF (“phonetic form”) and LF (“logical form”). This was not always the case, but it is for our p urposes good enough. At the risk of sounding enigmatic, in Minimalism D-structure and S-structure disappear , leaving at the branch node “sp ell out” and replacing PF with PHON and LF with SEM. That is an approximation. In one form of Minimalism, perhaps the best p icture is , with the vertical line represen ting the operations involved in semantic interpretation, where these involve Merge alone, and the horizontal line representing phonological/phonetic operations, with the node at which they branch out representing “spell out” where phonological features are stripped of f and a sepa rate sound-spec ific form of computations proceed. The current picture is rather more complicated than this, but the story so far suffices for our purposes. Phrase structure grammars are simpler in relevant respects (acquisition, which can be thought of here in terms of number of rules to learn) than finite state grammars, and transformational grammars simpler still. Beginning with pure phrase structure grammars, we will find o ut why at a reasonable mini mum we need transformational grammars. Unlike finite state grammars as understood by several of Chomsky's under graduates, a phrase structure grammar recog nizes categories of elements (N (noun), V (verb), etc.) and of fers ways to relate them in phrasal and clausal structures (NP (noun phrase), CP (complementizer phrase), S (sentence), etc.). Chomsky's phrase structure grammars consisted of a set of r ewrite rules . Rewrite rules take as input formal category symbols such as S and, as output of the op eration “rewrite as,” other formal category symbols such as NP and VP (verb phrase). A context-free phrase structure grammar does not specify in what environments a rewrite rule applies, while a context- dependent one does. Chomsky's early phrase structure grammars are context-dependent. For simplicity of presentation, though, I limit this exposition to a few context-free rewrite rules. One rewrite rule says that the symbol S can be rewritten as the symbol NP plus the symbol VP: S → NP + VP. NP and VP can in turn be rewritten. To capture a VP such as “left Harry's book” we need a symbol V (for verb “left”) p lus a symbol NP (for “Harry's book”). We need, then, a rewrite rule like this: VP → V  +  NP. After continued successive app lication of categorial (S, NP, …) rewrite rules, one eventually reaches single lexical category symbols like N and V. At this point in (1957) Chomsky introduces rewrite rules that say which lexical items can be inserted. There might, for example, be a rule V → [wash, rinse, …], which says that V can be rewritten by substituting any of a specified group of verbs. (In (1965) lexical category symbols rewrite as clusters of lexical features.) An important set of rewrite rules for English captures verbal auxiliary structure, crucial for the assignment of tense, modality , and the distribution of the auxiliaries “have” and “be.” Without this set of rules, there could not be anything like a recognizable English sentence. (Notice, for example, that every sentence in English is tensed.) Chomsky's two rules in (1957: 39) are: with M = modal and C, for present purposes, identified with tense. Modals (“must,” “can,” etc.) include “will,” so that one can get the effect of the future tense, even if the only morphophonemic realizations of tense (which is what Chomsky then called the component that yields phonemes, or ‘sounds’) in English are the past (“-ed,” as in “walked”) and the present, which is ‘unmarked’ (without “-ed,” as in “walk”). Parentheses around a symbol indicate that it is optio nal; thus, only C is obligatory . C's role in subject–verb agreement and the rules that provide for progre ssive verbs, introduce word boundaries, and do the other work necessary to make a string in terpretable by the morphophonemic part of a grammar can be ignored here. These rewrite rules are not enou gh; we need to move beyond the rewrite rules of a phrase structure grammar to add at least one transfor mation. It is needed in order to have affixes ‘hop’ across word stems so that we get an English-sounding string. The hopping rule is: “Let Af stand for any of the affixes past , S, Ø, en , ing . Let v stand for an M or V, or have or be (i.e., for any non-af fix in the phrase Verb ). Then: where # is inter preted as word boundary” (Chomsky 1957: 39). In other words, to make “walked,” we need to have past affix “ed” jump over “walk” and attach itself, after which there is a word boundary . Transformations, as this examp le illustrates, take structural descriptions and subject them to a structural change , so introducing movement of elements. The passive transformation rule as it appears in 1957, to provide another example, takes the structured string NP-Aux-V-NP (“Beavers build dams,” with Aux here amounting to the present tense alone) and transforms it accord ing to the passive rule X1–X2–X3–X4 → X4–X2+be+en–X3 by Xl (“Dams are built by beavers,” or more accurately, before relevant other transformations apply: “Dams PRES be+en build by beavers”).) The two phrase structure rules V → Aux + V and Aux → C(M) (have + en) (be+ing) (be+en) plus the affix-hopping transformational rule and appropriate lexical rules provide any English auxiliary sequence, such as any of these: Harry washed the car. Harry will wash the car. Harry will have washed the car. Harry will have been washing the car . Harry has washed the car. Harry has been washing the car . etc. The fact that we cannot attach affixes in the right way without transformations indicates trouble if one asks a pure phrase structure grammar to deal with English or other natural languages. A pu re phrase structure grammar cannot move the elements in a string, once they have been introduced . That is why in the illustration above, an affix transforma tion was needed. Rewrite rules to deal with affixes could be provided, but only at the cost of losing the simplicity of the basic auxiliary rewrite rules and substituting several rules to deal with each class of cases. Lost too, surely, would be improvements in learnability: the mo re rules one must learn, the harder it is to learn a language. To be descriptive ly adequate, a pu re phrase structure grammar would have to include all the rules required to produce various pas sive constructions for different tenses and modals, different kinds of relative clause constructions, and the large number of other forms that the sentences of English can take. It would have to be extraordinarily complicated and unwieldy , requiring many additional ‘rules’, many of which would have to be not just specific to Eng lish, but ad hoc to deal with differences in particular constructions, lexical items, etc. A phrase structure grammar cannot, therefore, make good sense of the POS observations for English, or for any other language. So, Chom sky argued, any grammar adequate to English and other natural languages must at least include transformations. They greatly reduce the number of rules needed to construct a grammar of a natura l language. The reason to at least begin with transformational grammars is found in the need for a grammar to at the same time be descriptively adeq uate and generate all and only the sentences of a specific lan guage (here seen crudely as the natural langua ge English, with non e of the complications of individual variations) while demanding that a child's mind acquire as few and as simple rules as possible. When introduced, transformations were defined over structural descriptions and mandated structural changes, essentially presupposing a phrase structure grammar (plus lexical insertion, both together constituting a base component (Chomsky 196 5: 84f) to provide the elements and structures to be transformed. In later usage, transformations are not tied to this picture, which is characteristic of (1957) and (1965), the latter representing the Standard Theory . Increasingly , “transformation” came simply to characterize any trans ition in the derivation of a sentence where an element changes position. Derivations of sentences in late Minimalism – which has abandoned a base co mponent, the infamous Deep Structure, its successor D-structure, and S-structure too – still has transformations in this sense in what was in the 1990s called Move, and afterwards, Internal Merge. Indeed, given the conceptual necessity of Internal Merge mentioned before, assuming that Chomsky' s analysis is correct, it should be difficult to conceive of a grammar that is not transformational. There are independent (althoug h related) grounds for thinking that all grammars shoul d deal with the “displacement property” (1995b: 50, 222, 324f). As suggested before, sentences with “whwords,” among others, provide reasons . Consider the sentence “Who did Harry and Harriet hope might work for them?” Intuitiv ely, it is understood in a way that requires that the person “who” is used to refer to be understood as the variable of an embedded element, “x work for Harry and Harriet,” despite the fact that what is seen or heard (the expression's phonetic or graphic appearance) puts “who” far away from “work.” A grammar must show both how “who” came to be displaced from its natural place, and how and why we automatically link it to its “natu ral” place. Any grammar must capture this movement and provide for its recovery . Thus, any grammar will involve transformations. The early transformational grammars did not last long. W ithout going into detail, while they of fered a great improvement in descriptive and explanatory adequacy over phrase structure grammars, they did not of fer much in the way of linguistic universals even in the base component, and thus required that much of a language be learned. Some universals were discovered then and survive still. An example is the principle of the cycle: transformations apply to “minimal” clauses/phrases in phrase markers, then to those sentences/clauses that contain them, and so on. This very strong empirical claim about how processing takes place in all natural languages turns ou t to be correct on the evidence so far, thus making an important contribution to a theory of UG. It survives in changing forms in Chomsky's later theories of language. But these earlier grammars were not very successful at eliminating a great many language-specific rules. The early English passive rule mentioned above is an example: it is spe cific to the way in which affixing occurs in English, and, worse, it bears little structural resemblance to the way in which some other languages work. So, while there were excellent reasons to choose a transformational (1965 usage) theory of language over a finit e state or phrase structure one, it was also clear that there had better be better theories. Explanatory adeq uacy in the acquisition sense (solving Plato 's problem) was still far away – along with universality and accommodation to biology . How the Principles and Parameters (P&P) framework makes a sentence The details of the post-(1965) and pre-P&P period (from abo ut 1965 to about 1 980), with its many adjustments and the development of the Extended Standa rd Theory , are important and reward study, but there is not space enough to discuss them in this book. One way of looking at them is that it became increasingly obv ious that a clean break from earlier efforts was nec essary; another is to see the details as a constant accumulation of changes moving in the direction of P&P, the signs of which were, in hindsight, apparent in earlier work. These two apparently very different perspectives can both be supported. But the clean break perspective is better for our purposes: it effectively solved the acquisition problem. The old picture of acquisition required some kind of internal algorithm that measured comparative simplicity in terms of number and length of rules. It was clumsy and depended on comparison with already-constructed grammars, and effectively disappeared when para meters came along. Below I indicate another reason: the P&P framework dispensed “entirely with rule systems for particular languages and particular constructions” ( Chomsky 1995b: 52). I discuss one of Chomsky's more technical ways of describing the progress later . First, we need to get clear how the P&P system works. Binding theory The P&P framework as originally introduced clustered its language- universal principles together in “theories” that deal with various interconnected language-universal phenomena. Case theory , fo r example, speaks to how the cases of nouns (nominative, accusative, and oblique, the last of which in cludes Latin's dative, genitive, ablative, etc.) are assigned and marked. I focus instead on another such ‘theory’ – binding theory . (My discussion is drawn from the informal (Chomsky 1988a), but I simplify the already simplified discussion there.) Binding theory deals with several important issues, among which are how a person who hears a sentence knows which pr onouns are bound by nouns (when bound, a pronoun must refer to whatever the noun is used to refer to), which nouns they are bound by, and which p ronouns are ‘free’ (can be used to refer to anything/anyone, without regard to what other nou ns and pronouns in the sentence are used to refer to) . Binding theory answers these questions without supposing that a child learns the answers to them by appeal to generalizations of specific data, such as “the pronoun and the noun in that sentence Harry muttered are both used by him to refer to the same thing.” Binding theory is defined over phrases. As should be clear by now , the concept of a phrase for natural languages amounts to the idea that all languages have clusters of words that have a specific kind of structure. Specifically , phrases have a head and a complement . Examples of heads of phrases are nouns (Ns) and verbs (Vs). If the head of a phrase is a noun, it is a no un phrase (NP); if the head of a phrase is a verb, it is a verb phrase (VP). Heads in different languages appear before or after their complements, so the general form of phrases allows order to be free; parametric options built into principles allow the order to be set in one way (head-initial) or the other (head-final). With this in mind, we can represent the general (universal) form of a phrase as XP  =  X —YP, with ‘—’ allowing heads before complements, and vice versa. As Chomsky says (1988a: 69): “we understand this formula to mean that for each choice of X (V, N, A[djective]) P[re(post)position]) there is a phrase XP (VP, NP, AP, PP) with the lexical category X as its head and the phrase YP as its complement.” In the verb phra se (VP) “left her under the tree,” the verb “left” is the head, and the complement includes a pron oun and a prepositional ph rase “under the tree” with prepositional head “under” and noun phrase (or determiner phrase) “the tree” that includes a determiner “the.” What is the status of “her?” Binding theory provides a pa rtial answer to this. It is crucial to the answe r that the pronoun appears within a phrase, for phrases help define (minimal) domains (1988a: 51). The (minimal) domain of a word is the smallest phrase in which it appears. In the case of Spanish “El ama a Juan” (He loves Juan), the domain of the pronoun “El”/“He” is the entire sentence. The pronoun is not in the VP; the next smallest phrase is, then, the who le clause, a sentence. In “John thinks he is intelligent,” the smallest domain containing “he” is the clause “he is intelligent.” Binding theory includes three principles. Two deal with forms of pronominal binding phenomena; the third deals with what are called “r- expressions” ((quasi-)referring expressions). 8 I ignore the last and discuss only the first two principles. One describes binding between nouns (and other pronouns) and pronouns like “her” above. (Do not confuse this with the poss essive pronoun “her,” which binding theory does not deal with.) Another describes the binding relationship between nouns (and other pronouns) and a special class traditionally called “reflexive pronouns” which include – in the case of a language like Spanish, which has terms such as “se” that precede a verb – clitics . Reflexives and the relevant kinds of clitics are called “anaphors.” Spanish clitic construction “se afeitar” translates into English as “shave himself,” a reflexive construction. An example of a reflexive sentence in English is “Harriet washed herself,” where “herself” is the anaphor . Anaphoric pronouns must be bound by some other element in the sente nce. You cannot interpret “Harriet washed herself” in such a way that “herself” (could be used to) refer(s) to anyone other than what “Harriet” is used to refer to. It cannot be used to refer to Jane. The same applies to all natural languages. Binding theory must capture this fact in its principles: “herself” is bound . It must also capture the fact that in “She wanted to leave before her dogs came back” there is a “she” that can be used to refer to any woman (or female dog or hippopotamus, for that matter), while the “her” in this sentence can refer either to the p erson (or dog or hippopotamus) referred to by the subject “she” or to some other female creature. Similar p oints apply to all other sen tences in English, and to all other natural languages. A pronoun that can be used to refer to anything without regard to what other nouns or pronouns in a sentence are used to refer to is fr ee. Consider two principles of binding theory: 1. An ana phor must be bound within the minimal domain of a subject (Chomsky 1988a: 77). 2. A pronoun must be free in the minimal domain of a subject (1 988a: 78). (The third principle is that r-exp ressions are free; there are exceptions (cf. 1986: 8 0), but none of this is discussed here.) According to the second principle, a pronoun must be free in a phrase/clause containing a subject. That makes sense for “She left him”: “she” is the subject pron oun; both it and the pronoun “him” are in the minimal domain of a subject; and both are free. Switching examples, if we are to find out whether or not “her” in “Harriet washed her under the tree” is bound or free, we cannot restrict ourselves to the phrase that contains “her” – the VP “washed her under the tree” – but must look for a minimal domain that contains the element and also con tains a subject. The minimal domain of “her” that contains a subject is in this case the whole sentence. Clearly, “her” is free; it cannot be bound by “Harriet.” So, on the basis of this further bit of evidence, principle 2 again seems plausible. Consider now “Harriet washed herself under the tree.” Here, “herself” is an anap horic pronoun, so questions about binding are dealt with by principle 1. According to the principle, “herself” must be bound within the minimal domain of a subject (here, “Harriet”). And it is, by “Harriet.” So this principle has some evidence in its favor . “Herself” need not be bound by the subject itself; it might be bound by an object term. But let us restrict ourselves to cases where the reflexive pronoun is bound by the subject NP. Consider “Whom did Harry have shave himself?” (“whom” is a “wh-word,” mentioned before as causing trouble for finite state grammars (and other grammars too)). Who is “himself?” It does not look as if it is Harry, even though “Harry” is a subject of a sentential clause and is the closest noun, on surface appearances at least, to “himself.” If surface closenes s to a reflexive element were all there were to defining a minimal domain of a subject, “Harry” would be the subject of a minimal domain containing “himself,” an d Harry, according to the principle, would have to be “himself.” So, if the principle is correct, there must be another subject somewhere that serves to bind “himself.” Chomsky's hypothesis (supported by other aspects of the theory of syntax and by massive evidence) is that “himself” is bound to a hidden element that refers to whoever the interrogative pronoun “whom” is used to refer to (cf. 1988a: 84). To see how it is tied, it help s to put the sentence in the qua ntificational phraseology that logicians favor . In that phraseology , the sentence amounts to something like this: “Who is the person x such that Harry had x shave x?” On this way o f looking at it, the interrogative pronoun is actually a quantifier binding a variable x that operates over a clause of the form “x shave x.” If that is the case, we must think of the sentence “Whom did Harry have shave himself?” as containing what Chomsky calls a “trace” element (in Chomsky's current accounts, a “copy” that stays in place and is visible at the semantic interfac e, but not the phonetic) that serves as the subject that defines the minimal domain of a subject for the reflexive element “himself.” When hearing something that is said, or p roducing a sound, the mind “sees” a trace (copy) that has the role of a bou nd variable within lo gic, an d it is this variable that constitutes the subject that defines the minimal domain of a subject containing “himself.” To say much more, we would have to begin to delve into trace theory and into the third principle of bindin g theory , and to bring it up to date, into the copy theory of movement. We have seen enough to establish the point for present purposes. The basic idea is that traces (copies) are left when elements are moved (copied) from their original positions during a derivation of an expression from another form and that these traces (copies) are apparent to the mind. This p reserves principle 1 of binding theory (and supports trace theory and its principles too). Binding – at least on this limited evidence – is internal to the language faculty (syntactic) and universal across all languages. This result presupposes, though, that one can provide an independent account of what a phrase is, for bindi ng is stated over phr ases. Let us turn, then, to the question of how the P&P approach dealt with phrases, at least at the beginning of the framework. X-bar theory As we saw, the (1965) Standard Theory had too many languag e-particular transformational rules to solve Plato's problem. Its base component – phrase structure plus lexicon compon ent – had the same problem . The P&P framework of (Chomsky 1981b) spoke to a surfeit of transformational rules by intro ducing a single transformational rule – “move-α ” (something like “move anything anywhere”). It spoke to the lack of uniformity in different languages' bases by adopting and adapting X-bar theory , which had been developing in the intervening Extended Standard Theory framework for some time before. X-bar theory , essentially , postulates the same structure in all languages (parametrically sanctioned variations such as head- initial/head-final aside) and in phrases of all sorts, whether no un phrases, verb phrases, or any other . The definition in the previous section of a phrase having a head and a complement (XP = X — YP) incorporates this point: it makes no difference what category a head is (noun, verb, etc.), it heads a phrase o f that category (NP, VP, etc.) that can take a complemen t consisting of a phrase of some category or another . But where does this structure come from? In (1981b: 29) Chomsky suggested it be seen as pr ojected fro m a lexical item of a pa rticular category , where projection takes the features of a lexical item with it to higher levels of processing. The discussion below sketches what is involved, but it is important to recognize that the (1981b) adaptation of X- bar theo ry and the concept of projection are incomplete solution s when seen from the viewpoint of work in the Minimalist Program. The structure that X-bar theory fin ds in all phrase s and the mechanism of project ion call out for explanation in terms of more fundamental theoretical devices – and that is what Chomsk y's recent Minimalism attempts to provide. In doing so, it gets rid of this lingering residue of a base component in grammar. To be clear about where this discussion of the earlier, pre-Minimalist effort is going, this is the progression: binding theory needs phrases; phrases need X-bar theory and projection; X-bar theory and projection, and thus the “base componen t,” can be absorbed into something else – essentially , into Merge and the copy account of movement based on Internal Mer ge. The following discussion of X-bar is close to the (1981a) Lectur es on Government and Binding exposition (cf. 1995b: 51–3) but draws from Cook and Newsom's (1996) well-developed expositi on. The term “X-bar” can confuse. “X” is easy enough; it is a placeholder – a kind of variable – for categories . Categories include N, V, A, P, and, as we will see, I(nflectional ), D(eterminer), and C(omplementizer). The first four are lexical categories; the last three are functional categor ies. (Functional categor ies are disputed for reasons that are beyond the scope of this book.) The notion of a bar confuses the uninitiated, partic ularly as the convention that started the terminology is now defunct. It comes from a time when levels found in phrase structure were designate d by putting no, one, or two bars above a category label. To adapt the co nvention to easier typing and typography , though, zero-level category indicators are as before, N, A, V, P, (or N0 , etc.), single bar is now N′, V′ (or N1 , Vl, … ), and double bar, N”, V” (or N2 , V2 , …). As having a uniform variable for different kinds of category suggests, all categories – N, V , D, etc. – project the three bar levels and their associated phrasal structures in the same way . X-bar theory's claim that the basic phrasal structure of all categories of lexical items in natural language s is the same is cashed out in the view that each category of lexical item projects in the same way and carries with it its demands on the kinds of item that can be placed in a full phra se structure with it. The schema for phrase structure in the discussion of binding theory , ‘XP = X — YP’, with ‘—’ unor dered to allow heads (N, V, … ) to p recede or follow complement YPs is captured by projection and X-bar theory . I o ffer only a few illustrations limited to English, a head-initial language. A noun phrase, as the phrasal structure schema claims, consists of a noun head N and a co mplement, where a complement is a (complet e) phrase of some so rt. The phrase “horse un der cover” has a noun head N (“horse”) and a PP compleme nt, “under cover ,” which itself has a preposit ion head P (“under”) and an NP complem ent that has an N head and null (or no) complement. It is diagrammed as in (1). The idea is straightforward: choose a lexical item of any of the four categories, and it projects the same basic structure as any other category of item – ahead of that category and a phrasal complement, both “under” and dominated by an XP (NP, VP, or N”, V”). In addition, the lexical item makes o ther demands on the structure, dependent on its particular features (which are projected along with the item to “higher” levels in the structure of a sent ence). The verb “build,” for example, is happy with a D(eterminer) P(hrase) comple ment (“build the bicycle”), but “lurk” seems to exclude one: “lurk the building” is odd . The noun “cover” – as above – does not require an explicit complement, so can go null; it could, however , have a PP complement (“under cover in the barn”), which itself has a determiner phrase complement. Intuitively , if all the words in a sentence are satisfied with their complements and an y other items involved in projection of a category , all is well: we are on the way to projecting a grammatical sentence/expression which – assuming it does not overload our performance systems – we can speak/hear and understand. The structure indicated in (1) is not enough, however . So far, we have an illustration of only two bar levels, one for XP (NP, VP, …) and one for heads X (N, V, … ) and their complements. We have no place to attach specifiers for phrasal structure, among which are determiners (Ds), which include “the” and “a:” “the horse” is a determiner phrase that includes a specifier D (“the”) that ‘specifies’ the NP head with null complement “horse.” D cannot be a complement for this NP; nor can it be the head N (“horse”); it also seems to be of f on the left side of N in English, a head- initial language. To slot in speci fiers, we need to insert another position and another level into phrasal structure. Another motivat ion is that we need to insert a second level between head X an d XP to deal with the different status of the complemen ts of some verbs that appear to take two or more phrasal complements. Different complements can have different degrees of “connection” to the verb: the verb “watch” in the phrase “watched Harry on Friday,” for example, insists on a much tighter connection with “Harry” than with the PP “on Friday,” which we could, for example, drop. This tighter connection is represented by making the NP structure for N “Harry” a sister of the V “watch” and placing the PP “on Friday” in a structurally detached position away from the sisters. Sister elements are immediately dominated by the same element; they are, then, at the same bar level. The sisterhood of the V “watch” and the NP structure for “Harry” is represented by placing another bar level, V′, between the lexical category head level, here the V level, and the VP (V”), and having both V “watch” and NP “Harry” dominated by V′. The ‘detached’ character of the PP “on Friday” is represented by making it a sister of V′ (not V), where both are dominated by the VP (V”) – see (2). In effect, X-bar theory requires that each lexical item project three bar levels: X (which in effect says what category of lexical item it is), X′ (which is less intuitively clear, but is needed for the reasons indicated above), and X” (which is the obviously needed level VP, NP, PP, etc.). Notice, too, that the information specific to the lexical item (represented in its features) is carried along to higher bar levels, where it can p lay a role in determining with which other lexical items and their projected structures it can be placed to make an expression grammatical. Now for specifie rs: where are they to be put? If phrasal complements are sisters to N, V, etc. and are dominated by an X′ level, specifiers are at the same bar level as V′. Thus, X” levels (NPs, VPs, etc.) may have a specifier alongside their X's (N′, V′, etc.). According to a plausible account, Ds or determiners are specifiers of NPs, so that for the DP “the womba t,” we have (3). A sp ecial category of phrase called an “inflectional phrase,” or IP, takes a special I′ that dominates and makes sisters of an abstract element, called “I,” in specifier position whos e features represent the requirements for subject–verb agreement and ten se for a sentence and – as sister to I – a VP for its complem ent. This complement is the VP that represents the rest of the sente nce and contains the sentence's subject in its NP specifier position. This leaves an odd-looking structure with a null specifier and a bunch of features under I – see (4). Something much closer to the familiar sentence structure we hear and see is provided by movement (the displacement property mentioned before). Intuitively , one can think of the VP's specifier NP ‘movin g into’ the position provided by the currently empty specifier position for IP, and think of the VP's V head moving (leaving a trace) by a transfor mation into (‘raised to’) the I position, where tense and agreement are assigned to the verb. This ends up looking more like sentences we are familiar with. For “Harry sees Fido” (but without tense and number agreement) we have (5). An IP, or inflec tional phrase, with the abstract element I in specifier position is, then, a before-move ment approximation to the ordinary notion of a sentence. Two more details need to be dealt with: adjuncts and complementizer phrases. X′ levels can take adjuncts . Adjuncts include adverbs (fo r V's), relative clauses (for N's), and “wh” constructions for V′ (“wondered whether he would be able to survive”). Relative clauses such as “that Harry decided to leave” and “wh” co nstructions constitute a sp ecial class of phrases called “complementize r phrases,” or CPs; a CP is a bit like a sentence with subject, predicate, and (often) tensed verb, but is embedded within another sentence: “The woman who lost at darts today won the match yesterday.” A CP has a complementizer C at level X (complementizers include “who,” “that,” “which,” and “whether”), and its single-bar C′ governs the sisters C and an IP. The category C, like I, is called a “functional category .” This is not the occasion to go into the complicated and disputed territory of functional categories and functional phrases. They do, however , play a crucial role in movement as understood in X-bar theory , as the earlier brief discussion of IPs suggests. They thereby play a crucial role in making a sentence represented in X-bar theory into something that looks like the sentences we are familiar with. As for adjuncts, part of their importance lies in their role in natural language productivity . Part of creativity (specifically , part of unboundedness) lies in the fact that adjuncts can iterate, allowing sentences of unlimited length that nevertheless all meet the univ ersal demands of X-bar theory , suitably parameterized with respect to order for specific natural languages. In English they iterate to the right of a phrasal head (N, P, …) by supplying another X′ and making the adjunct the sister of the head's original X′. An N′ iterates as shown in (6). Much more cou ld be said, but we have seen enough to appreciate that projection and X-bar theory yield powerful generalizations over all languages, providing support for Chomsky's solution of the acquisition problem (Plato's problem). But what is projection, and where did the structure – sometimes rather arcane, as with X′ – come from ? It would be far better to simplify and get rid of unexplained primitives by showing that projection and the structure of X-bar theory are merely ep iphenomena, the way things look to the theoretician who hasn't quite got to the heart of the matter. Specifically , it would be preferable if projectio n were the result of even more primitive operations on lexical items, biologically motivated if motivation is necessary , and if the structure found in X-bar theory were located entirely within lexical items themselves, not adventitiously imposed on them. That is one thing that Chomsky's Minimalist Program aims to do. One basic assumption of the Minimalist Program in its earlier (1995b) version is that structure introduced into the computation of an expression (a (PHON, SEM) pair) must be “co nstituted of elements already present in the lexical items” (1 995b: 228); bar levels, not being among the features of a lexical item itself, cannot be introduced later in a computation. The motivation behind this assumption is clear: a true Minimalist will want to eliminate anything as complex and – apart from appearing descriptively useful – unexplained as X-bar theory , especially if it is read not merely as a description of phenomena, but as structural conditions imposed from outside – perhaps biology , per haps some other factor – on permissible grammatical structures. We need something better grounded and simpler that does the same work – that introduces the structure in a motivated way. Projection and X-bar theory quite nicely describe various levels within the grammars of all languages and provide a convenient and plausible framework for dealing with movement. But we must somehow get its positions, levels, and – more important – such relations as head to complement, without leaving what philosophers of science call “danglers.” So how do we get the appea rance of bar levels described by X-bar theory? I only hint at how it works. Assume first that any plausible grammar is going to have to provide for at least two levels, even if not levels as constru ed in X-bar syntax. One is a lexical, or X, level, and the other can be called an Xmax level. Lexical items themselves do duty for the X level; Xmax is defined in terms of operations in the system and is an analogue for XP. The reason for instituting these two levels is that (in terms of X-bar theory) only XPs and Xs (now just lexical items) mov e to appear at in terface levels. X′-level items do not, hinting that there might be a reason for the unintuitive character of this bar level. Chomsky's Minimalism is an ongoing project that has been becoming more Minimalist as time goes o n. In its early stages at the begin ning of the 1990s, there was no real effort to actually replace X-bar theor y. The first attempt to do so appeared in chapter 4 of (199 5b) and Chomsky's lectures, particularly his fall syntax lectures at MIT in 1995 and 1996. (He did not lecture in 1997.) A discussio n of some of his more recent work in producing yet more austere acco unts appears in sketched form above and is found in more detail in his “Minimalist Inquiries” (2000b) continuing through (2001, 2002, 2004a, 2004b, 2005a, 2007d, 2010). It continues still. One key to Chomsky's view of how to conceive of the derivation of a sentence, in line with the assumption referred to in the last paragraph, is that a comp utation leading to an expression begins with a group of fully specified lexical items that in a sense contain in themselves all the properties needed to fix their place in a derivation. 9 Think of lexical items as sets of features, and the elementary and ineliminable process that leads them to eventually express (to other systems) their combinatorial and structural proper ties at PHON o r SEM as Merge. As we have seen, Merge places pairs of lexical items – clusters of lexical features – together , and, like chemical substances, they either combine or fail to com bine. If an attempt to combine fails because their intrinsic properties rule it out, the effort ceases. When they do co mbine, one of the two lexical items (just a cluster o f features, actually, but for convenience I speak of lexical items) becomes the “label” of the combination and (in effect) the head. Using set notation to reflect the fact that we are dealing with clusters of features and set inclu sion, assume the following selection of lexical items: {the, river, Wanda, watch}, with “watch” having among its features [verbal] (i.e., V), “river” including [concrete] and [nominal] (i.e., N), “the” [determiner]. Imagine that Merge takes the “the” and “river”; the result is {the, {the, river}}, with “the” as label. {River, {river, the} is obviously ruled out by the lexical items' features: one of the features of “the” is [determiner], and nouns do not determine determiners. So features control which lexical item is the ‘label’ of the merged pair . The result is, in effect, a DP, with “the” as head and “river” as complement, as shown in (7) – already a change from X-bar theory: With this successful combinatio n in place, Merge can then take another lexical item and attempt to merge it with the first successfully combined one (which is simply another , more complex syntactic “object”). Say it attempts to combine it with “watch.” The combination works, and a new label is chosen. With the choice between the old label (“the”) and “watch,” the choice is obvious: it is “watch.” The result is {watch, {watch, {the, {the, river}}}} – in effect, “watch” makes itself into the ‘head’ of a ‘VP’, “watch the river.” (“Watch” could hardly be the ‘complement’ of a ‘DP’.) Then Merge might also try to put together the label “watch” with the remaining lexical item, “Wanda.” Here, the old label becomes the label of the combination; in effect, “Wanda ” becomes the ‘subject’ term in the VP, while “watch” ‘projects’. We get the effect of heads, levels, and dominance with sets of features and labels of merged items. We also get the effect of projection: lexical items are nothing but their features, and while features may be eliminated, none are added. As Chomsky puts it, the syntactic objects we are considering are of the following types: a. lexical items b. K = {α, {α, β}}, where α, β are objects and α is the label of K Objects of type [a] are complexes of features listed in the lexicon. The recursive step is [b]. (1995b: 243) (Now on e would speak simply of External and Internal Merge and the sets they create and manipulate, an even simpler story .) Projecti on becomes not a matter of putting lexical items with their features into a fixed schema that all phrases must conform to but merely one of merging and labeling the combinations, with the label assigned depending on the features of the items. Positions such as specifier are ‘created’ by functional features of lexical items. The two crucial ‘levels’ involved in movement in X-bar syntax, lexical items (Chomsky in (1995b) also speaks of them as Xmin s) and XPs (or Xmaxs) are now just ways to describe merged lexical items. What were X′ positions in X-bar theory become cases where a label is repeated in a derivation. This is illustrated by the example above. Keeping in mind that “Wanda” will eventually Move (now , internally Merge) out of the VP and that tense and verb agreement (functional matters both) have to be dealt with by further processing, the diagrammatic repres entation of what we have so far is as shown in (8). The top label “watch” is at the Xmax position; the lower “watch” gives the effect of an X′ level. What was the rather odd-looking intermediate level of X′ becomes a no-longer X max (or no-longer XP) that has lost any chance of ap pearing at the interface. Paraphrasing an observation of Sam Epstein's, Chomsky remarks that this result is “quite natural, these ob jects being ‘fossils’ that were maximal (hen ce visible at an interface) at an earlier stage of derivation, targeted by the operation that renders them invisible” (1995b: 382, n. 24). So one can squeeze all that one needs of X-bar theory out of packaged lexical features and Merge (plus Move, now absorbed into Merge) and receive as a bonus a natural explanation of why the X-bar levels X, X′, and X” have such different effects at SEM. It also bring s into focus the centrality of the lexicon and its nature. Some aspects of the lexicon are discussed in the next chapter . The above is the view from 199 5 or thereabouts, with a hint or two that things have changed and impro ved even more in simplicity and answering the acqu isition issue. To explain just how the 1995 version of derivation became that of approximately (2005a) and beyond would require introducing cons iderable additio nal material. For example, the introduction of third factor considerations in 2005 is easy enough to understand in itself, but to explain why Chomsky has adopted the particular line of argument he has with it requi res going back to the 1980s and beyond, where there was a growing realization that linguistic differences – what appeared to be differences in structure – could be located in differences in the ways language is ‘sounded out’ (or ‘signed out’), not in differences in the ways in which meaning or ‘semantic’ pr ocessing took place. That, and an intuition that has persiste d from the earliest days of the Port Royal grammarians in the seventeenth century to the present – that so far as meaning and meaning composition is concerned, all languages are the same – helps make clear why Chomsky wants to both lo cate all language differences in third factor considerations and attribute these to phonological/phonetic proc essing, and why he suggests that the evo lution of language could amount to the introduction of Mer ge alone. Movement, progress, perfection – and evolution Let us return briefly to the issue with which this discussion of which grammars are better than (more adequate by the standards of natural science methodology than) others began . The discussion focused initially on why it was important to introduce transformational grammars. The answer was that these constituted the minimally adequate grammars for dealing with displacement, o r with movement of elements in a derivation. Something like movement is needed to deal with long-range dependency , among other things, and transformational grammars of fer at least some progress in meeting desiderata of explanato ry (acquisition) and descriptiv e adequacy compared to finite state and pure phrase structure grammars. Nevertheless, Chomsky until fairly recently considered movement and its later non- moving substitutes (traces and copies) to be an imperfection in the ‘design’ of language's computational system – a messy, kludgy imperfection in comparison, at least, to the “conceptual necessity” of concatenation of lexical items (jo ining one element to another to produce senten ces/phrases with the structure that they need to have. As we saw earlier in my sketch of the most recent version of Min imalism and again just above, however , he no lo nger does so: Move becomes Internal Merge, which is just a variant of concatenation (External Mer ge). This represents progress at meeting the demands of natural science methodology . So far as the combinatory operations of FLN are concerned, it allows UG (the genetic contribu tion to language) to be compressed into a single pr inciple. That goes a sign ificant way towards solving the acquisition issue (the major explanatory adequacy issue until recently). And it allows for a saltational (single jump) account of the evolution of langu age, which is consis tent with what little evidence we have concerning its introduction into our species ; in doing so, it advances the cause of accommodation to biology . Further, it simplifies the formalism, makes language (the core computational system) universal, and advances objectivity . Progress focuses on a part of the core computational system alone, of course, and leaves open other tasks, including producing theories of how and why human concepts and linguistic sounds cluster together in semantic and phonological features. But the advances are nevertheless significant. Minimization of UG clearly solves the acquisition problem for the computational path from lexical items to SEM: Merge is built into our genome, requiring only triggering. But it leaves open the issue of how children's minds develop the capacity to linearize – how they manage to ‘sound out’ the meanings of phrases and sentences. The computational path to PHONs looks messy and allows for many variants (parameters and microparameters (Kayne 2000, 2005)). Explaining acqu isition looks a lot harder. As Chomsky puts it, morphology , phonology , [most of the parameters, maybe all of them,] and all the externalization systems. … [T]hey are messy. There's no reason for them to be computationally good. You're taking two co mpletely independent systems. The sens ory-motor system has apparen tly been around for hundreds of thousands of years. It doesn't seem to have adapted to language, or only marginally . So it's just sitting there. You've got this other system – whatever developed internally – and there's every reason to expect that it might be close to computationally pe rfect, for there are no forc es acting on it. So it would be like cell division . So then, when yo u're going to map them together , it's going to be a mess. (C&M: 51) As suggested earlier, Chomsky hopes that some answers to explaining acquisition in ‘sounding out’ can be found in third factor (non-biological but natu re-based) constraints o n growth and development. If third factor considerations p lay a major ro le – it is an empirical matter – language acquisition will still be largely automatic, with the diversity of options traced to parameters and the fine-grained differences exemplified by microparametric differences. There is some evidence in favor of this strategy (C&M: 30, 54f). And there is, of course, the observational fact that children do develop a language quickly un der POS conditions. There must be unive rsal con straints, althoug h they need not be biologically based in the human genome. Minimization o f UG allows Chomsky to address the matter of the perfection of language. He spoke at the beginning of the Minimalist Program of optimality of language design and efficiency of computation, suggesting that language is not a system put together helter-skelter, but good design. It is more like the elegant ‘design’ of physical and chemical phenomena than the messy kludges one often finds in the biological domain. As François Jacob put it, evolution appears to be a tin kerer that is apt to produce bricolage (the work of the odd-job worker and weekend amateur), not the elegant and well-made designs of the master craftsperson. But perhaps in the case of language – and perhaps also other systems – the accusation of bricolage is wrong. D’Arcy Thompson and more recently Alan Turing in his work on morphogenesis thought that design o f biological or ganisms is a lot more elegant than the term bricolage would suggest. Turing went so far as to reject the ‘historical’ view of evolution and the idea of tinkering. He attempted to pla ce biology (as Chomsky put it to me once) in the departments of physics, chemistry, and mathematics, rescuing it from kludges. The elegant designs of flowers and seed patterns such as those found in the center of the sunf lower – a design reflecting the Fibonacci series – suggests that he might be right, at least in part. The idea that biological entities show evidence of perfection in design goes back to at least Goethe. Chomsky mentions Goethe in (1966/20 02/2009). Goethe suggested that the design of pl ants respects a mathematically formulable design principle built into nature and its constraints on or ganic growth. As we have seen, there was little evidence of elegant design in early grammars. There appeared to be a few universal principles, but also many language-specific rules. Yet the facts of the POS suggested otherwise: children develop languages in what appears to be a channeled way, coming to maturity in an ordered manner . Increasing generality and simplicity in grammars and improvements in ways to deal with these poverty observations ove r the decades of fered increasing evidence of good design. And now that the Minimalist Program has made considerable headway, computation begins to appear simpler , uniform, and more elegant still – at least, on the computational path to SEM. A caveat: disabuse yourself of the idea that design requires a designer . Nature displays design, but that is due to the basic structures an d natures of natural objects and processes and the options they of fer. If language is a ‘natural object’, then, it is not designed for anything. There is no function or functions that the language faculty fulfills, no ‘job’ it does except in the formal sense that it combines lexical items and provides their information to relevant interfa ces. Clearly, for example, it is not designed for the philosophers' favorite candidate, communication. Communication requires linearizing semantic-pragmatic information at SEM that includes traces/copies. Linearizing introduces computational inef ficiencies and interpretational problems. In fact, we can't even say that language is designed for thought. It is true that unless people did use the computational system of language for thinking (commonsense problem-solving), the mutation that led to language would probably not have survived. But that does not speak to why langu age has the design that it does – and specifically , to why at least so me of the design seems to be perfect – elegant, simple. To speak to that, you must construct a natural science theory of the language faculty, and take seriously the demand that theories be simple. Nature need not be simple. But, remarkably, natural science methodology seems to indicate that it is, even in some or ganic domains. Implicit in the discussion above is a strong critique of popular dogma concerning evolution. I cannot go into detail; for that, see C&M. I will just make three points. (1) Natural selection does not build structures; its role is to ‘select’ which modifications in structure inherent in natural entities and processes that result from some event (“mutation”) persist in a species. (2) Skinner the behaviorist was right: the popular view of evolution as adapting an or gan ism to an environment is very much like a drawn-out version of behaviorism. According to that view, what is ‘inside’ the or ganism (including its mental structures and processes) is the result of the environments in which an or ganism exists. But this view of adaptation and thus the popular view (and Skin ner) are wrong: see the first point. (3) As Richard Lewontin (19 98) pointed out in his criticism of ‘just so’ stories such as that told by Pinker and Bloom in (1990 ) (and variants told by many others) about the evolution of language, it can be very difficult to actually find evidence of the evolution of human mental/cognitive faculties and capacities. Coping with differences The discussion suggests that linguists are committed to describing and explaining not only what makes human languages the same an d unique to humans, but also what makes them different. Not all differences are relevant, of course. The specif ic associations of particular concepts with specific ‘sounds ’ are not. They reflect Saussurean arbitrariness , at least so far as the natural science of language is concerned. They are, o f course, of interest to individuals and to sociolinguists. And the times and rates at which specific associations are made as the child develops can be of interest to the study of development, for it of fers insight into when and how children acquire and come to be able to use specific kinds o f relatively complex concep ts, such as BELIEVE; for relevant discussion, see Gleitman and Fisher (2005) and Gleitman et al. (2005). Perhaps, too, this kind of study can contribute evidence towards a general account of (commonsense) concept development/growth. The lang uage differences that the natural science of language must take into account are those that can be traced to nature and its contribution to language and its development. These contributions can be biological, but – especially during development – also due to physical, chemical, computational, and related con straints. The most recent approach to the study of language sketched above provides some insight into how and why recent work has tended to attribute language differences to the ‘sounding out’ or linearization comp utational path, preserving a uniform computational p ath to SEM. Where the P&P program originally built differences such as head–complement order into the principles themselves, recent Minimal ist work has tended to attribute differences to the linearization pat h. The advantage of doing so is that it minimi zes UG and makes it much more nearly possible to accommodate the science of language to biology , including addressing the question of evolution. Perhaps some structural constraints are built into linguistic principles; perhaps headedness is an example. But it is also quite possible that all apparent structural differences can be attributed to third factor constraints on grow th. It is an empirical issue, one to be resolved by employing the methods of natural science. As remarked before, actually explaining all the differences between languages might well require contributions from physics, chemistry, and the like. The point is a familiar one to those who are working in the field of evolution-development (“evo-devo”). The tasks of the compleat linguist are likely to expand – and to become more exciting. No tes 1 Linguists will likely ask: no phonology? No morphology? Please bear with me: these turn out to be included in syntax, broadly conceived. 2 That is not quite accurate. Chomsky's view of a lexical item is committed to meanings or concepts, formally defined in terms of “features,” which he sometimes also calls “properties.” For discussion, see the next chapter . 3 For Frege and some others, a ternary (or perhaps even more) relationship. See below . 4 There is an exception of sorts with the natural numbers. The sounds too, and definitely the concepts, can be seen as coming naturally to the child (given relevant stimulation), primarily because the natural number concepts (something like ways of counting) can be generated with a special case of Internal Mer ge. Start with some object, call it “zero” (0) and then form the set of 0 = {0}, or 1. Then Mer ge it to itself again and you get {{0}} or 2. Mer ge it to itself still again and you get {{{0}}} or 3. And so on. See C&M: 15–16. 5 See also the previous note. 6 The scare quotes around “information” indicate that the features found in LIs and provided at interfaces to other systems are not to be understood in a way they sometimes are, as “information about something.” In particular , they should not be understood as providing information about the world. That intentional (“of-ness,” “aboutness”) reading of “infor ‐ mation” is popular , but wrong. Reference and intentionality are features of use, not of LIs and what they provide at an interface. 7 For interesting discussion of Haskell B. Curry's attempt to construct a logic without quantifiers “out front” (thereby no longer having logic mimic and rely for ease of learnability upon natural languages with their clause-initial quantifiers ( every , some … ), ‘up front’ quantifier -like “wh- words” such as who , which, what , and similar devices – for example, who John wants to take him to the doctor reads as “for some person x, John wants x to take him to the doctor” – see C&M: 17. 8 They are in ‘referring position’. Whether a person uses them to refer is another matter . 9 Chomsky calls this view of lexical items and their role in derivation “inclusiveness”: intuitively , do not include in a derivation anything that is not already contained in the ‘materials’ with which you begin (here, LIs). He treats it as a natural assumption, a methodological assumption that promotes simplicity (C&M: 61–2). This assumption is disputed by – among others – those calling themselves “distributed morphologists.” An important example is found in the work of Hagit Borer . While sympathetic to Minimalism, she removes all structural features from her “lexemes” (something like LIs, consisting of clusters of semantic features to which is applied a phonological “stamp”, but no category labels) and relies on Merge plus some specialized lexemes of fering functional features to get categories such as N, plus morphology , plus structure. I do not discuss her view further, only mention here that there can be and are variant forms within the Minimalist Program. 6 Lin guistic Mean in gs an d Their Uses Differences in I-languages repre sent differences not just in structure, but in lexical items. Some such differences are irrelevant. Mental dictionaries can differ in the ways in which they associate a particular lexical item's ‘sound’ instructions with some cluster of ‘meaning’ instructions. To take an example from Chomsky (2000a), the sound “arthritis” could be associated with the meaning DISEASE OF THE JOINT, with the meaning DISEASE OF THE LIMB, or for that matter, with WALLABY or RISK. The natural scientist is not concerned with socially based conventional associations, only those underwritten ‘by na ture’. Speakers are concerned with which sound to associate with which concept, of course, for associ ating in the ways others do in one's linguis tic community enables chatting, gossiping, informing, and so on. But that concern is not and cannot be reflected in a natural science. Another way in which language s can differ is in the natures or characters of the specific ‘sounds’ and con cepts found in a particular pers on's mental dictionary . It is obvious that different languages such as Japanese and English sound different. But it is also the case that in a populati on of native English speakers, specific individuals will differ in their pronunciation, even though they all speak Eng lish, where this is understood as a group of I-languages that are sufficiently similar to one another to be thought of as a single natural language. And it is often the case that people will use two different pronunciations in form al settings as opposed to inform al; if so, the differences cons titute two different I-languages for the same ind ividual: one has to assign different phonological features to a group of lexical items in a person's mental dictionary . This is a form of context-sensitivity , of course, but one that a natural science of language can contend with, since all of the various options are in the scope of the theory of FLN. The point was made before: in order to describe an I-language properly , you must have available a theory that can describe any I-language. As for semantic or meaning differences: it is not just that people's vocabularies differ even though they are all “English speakers,” but that there can be differences in the specific semantic features that are placed in clusters and that constitute differences in meaning or concept. The difference can be notable. In Hebrew , for example, the more-or -less uniform concept WEAR of English (applied to all clothing such as shoes, jewelry, socks, ties, coats, etc., and readily yielding multiple metaphorical uses) is not found, but rather a cluster of concepts that appear to be sensitive to what is worn. Hebrew concept ANAD applies to jewelry and watches only (not glasses), GARAV is used only for socks, NAA’L apples to any kind of footwear (boots, shoes, sandals …) although it comes from the same root as what English expresses as SHOE. Further, HIRKIV is used for glasses, but also amounts to ASSEMBLE; HAGAR is used for belts; A’NA V, while rarely used, applies only to ties. As for taking of f clothes, it is HORID, while taking of f shoes is HALATZ. In each case, the action seems to take on a different character or texture, where it does not with the English WEAR.1 That is not to say that an English speaker could not understand the Hebrew concep ts, or vice-versa. It is only to say that there can be differences in concepts from one language (including I-language) to another , althoug h all are enc ompassed within the range of possible commonsense co ncepts, and are readily enough activated by any individual. In this sense, while perhaps special to one or a few languages, they are nevertheless universal. Words to perspectives to interpretations As the last chapter indicated, Chomsky believes that the computations from lexical items to SEMs is much more straightforward than tho se that lead from LIs to ph onological/phonetic ones. He also holds that they are on evolutionary gro unds more fundamental – that linguistic com munication and thus the n eed for externalization could well have com e after the introduction of Merge and the o pportunity that that opened for combining primitive concepts in ways unavailable to any other creature, thereby of fering an in-principle infinite range of complex meanings. That is part of the reason that when discussin g the contributions of lexical items to our understanding I focus on semant ic features and not phonological. And there is another reason too: it should be obvious that we get greater cognitive advantage from being given inf inite numbers of sentential meanings than we do from the ability to communicate them. We might even be able to cooperate without communication of conceptual complexes: given biologically similar conceptual and combinatory systems, we should be able without speech or sign to ‘get in their heads’ and figure out what they are up to when performing various actions. After all, apes and other or ganisms can and do cooperate on at least some tasks without language. And we can do so without actually employing articulate language (thus, linking concepts with sounds) too. Whether we can be conscious of and articulate what we understand is, however , another question. In our current state, however , we can be conscious of and articulate what we understand, for we can exercise inner speech. I menti oned earlier that Chomsky's informal term for a sentence's semantic interfa ce of SEM is “perspective.” So far in the discussion of Chomsky's view of language we have focused primarily on how perspectives are assembled; that is the job of a set of internal functions that take semantic features to a semantic interface. I also said in an earlier chapter what a word is thought to be in Chomsky's work, and o ffered a few hints concerning how to conceive of words' (LIs') “semantic features.” Following Chomsky , I also argued extensively against assuming that anyone could – with the exception of faculty-to-faculty interchanges – provide a science of their use in interpretation. Nevertheless, it is possible to say some sensible things about how perspectives can ‘instruct’ other systems and even ‘guide’ without determining the uses to which they are put. In this chapter I want to fill in some of the gaps that earlier discussions left open. I will say a little more about assembling per spectives. With the aid of seventeenth-century philosopher Ralph Cudworth, I will try to provide more detail concerning semantic features and their contributions to meaning. And I will discuss in a bit more detail than before the place of perspectives or SEMs in ‘making’ worlds. To recall, a (cog nitive) perspect ive according to Chomsky is a SEM. He says (19 95a: 20) that perhaps “ the weakest possible assumption about the LF [SEM] interface is that the semantic properties of the expression focus attention on selected aspects o f the world as it is taken to be by other cognitive systems, and provide intricate and highly specialized perspectives from which to view them, crucially involving human interests and concerns even in the simplest cases.” Remember that commonsense con cepts – the ones expressed in natural languages – are virtually made to be sensitive to human interests. And keep in mind that SEMs contribute to interpretation; they do not determine it. The idea that the language faculty makes cognitive perspective s that are of p articular interest to humans continues a theme that go es back to (1955/1975) and (1957) and to the idea that one might appeal to a ‘use theory’ to deal with how humans use language to refer to and characterize things in the world – how they interpr et lang uage. Even in the mid-195 0s, then, Chomsky thought langua ge provides ‘tools’ that people can use in various ways and situations to talk of things and themselves – perhaps to regale others with the antics of Mary's pet otter , to complain about the general lack of service now that the local shops are closed, or to fantasize about a world full of vampires. As noted above, there was a period when he thought it possible that interpre tation of language took place ‘underneath’, at Deep Structure. I discuss that period briefly again in the next section. It did not last long, and now , as for the most part before, he holds that in interpretation an ‘output’ of the language faculty, now called “SEM,” instructs or interacts with “conc eptual and intentional systems,” and its and their contributions to cognition enable people to think and deal with the world. That complex of intercha nges and human action is interpr etation . It is not, and may never be, clear what interpretation is; explaining what is involved would require a full account of the language faculty, broadly conceived (FLB). It is clear that it involves interaction with other systems in the head (“focus attention on selected aspects of the world as it is taken to be by other cognitive systems”) and that it involves free activity (including reference to things in the wor ld). Chomsky suggests that the only grip science is likely to get on it concerns relations to “other systems” in the head, no t reference to things o utside the head. Nevertheless, he provides enough in his p ersistent view of language as a tool (captured now in the notion of a perspective), in his model of mind, and in his approval of Cudworth's attempt to show ho w inner ideas do indeed bear on a world outside, for us to see that his biological rationalist position leads to the idea that, in interpre ting meanings (perspectives) by using them to refer and characterize, the human mind shapes and in some sense makes the world. His version of Goodman's worldmaking is discussed at the end of the chapter . D eep Structure again For Chomsky , linguistic meanings are those syntactically defined elements produced in a derivation that ‘feed’ interpretation, understand ing by this whatever is involved in relating the language faculty to “conceptual and intentional systems” and (perhaps) the world. Currently , meanings are SEMs that “giv e instruction to” these other systems and are found at the output of the computational process. For a while, at the time he wrote (1965), Chomsky adopted the idea that meanings are found ‘underneath’, at Deep Structure. This does not fit well with his view before and after (1965) that meanings are tools for use, produced by an innate, unconscious computation, that appear at or near the end of their derivations and bear marks o f their derivational history in the configuration of features found there. The persi stent view puts meanings at the ‘surface’, where they have been configured by the language faculty's derivational process to make them int o useful tools. It is instructive, however , to look briefly at some of the reasons why it might have seemed plausible to place them ‘underneath’. There were theoretical motivations in 1965 for introducing Deep Structure. Given commitment to a base (at the time, phra se structure grammar plus lexical insertion and obligatory transformations) that feeds a transformational component, and moved by the idea that nouns and pronouns have to be assigned their roles as agent of action an d as object (“theta-roles”) before they are displaced from their ‘natural’ positions by transformations, in 1965 it seemed plausible to postulate a level of representation that preceded the transformational, where at least some meaning-relevant matters are settled. Jerrold Katz and Jerry Fodor picked up on this idea and suggested that Deep Structure be the locus of semantic interpretation. This hypothesis commits one to the idea that Deep Structures are meanings, that in going from Deep to Surface Structure, tran sformations preserve meaning, and much more besides. In part because of the incautious nature of the commitment, Chomsky was uncomfortable with this hypothesis, even in (1965). He pointed out (1965: 224–5, n. 9) that Surface Structure also seemed to play an important role in semantic interpretation. And he thought that “the grammatical relations expressed in the abstract deep structure are, in many cases, just those that determine the meaning of the sentence” (162): “many ,” no t “all.” Nevertheless, he thought there was sufficient eviden ce in favor of the hypothesis to adopt it. He said: “T o the extent that relevant evidence is available today , it seems not unlikely that it is true” (1 17). I do not discuss the theoretical motivations further; they are irrelevant in Chomsky's Minimalist Program and only mildly relevant between 1965 and the 1990s as he continued to hold to a conception of a base component and to a successor of Deep Structure, D-structure. Arguably, they alone were never en ough to tip the scales. There were other motivations, o ne of which Chomsky seems to have taken seriously , and still does. It is found in studies of langu age at least as old as the Port Royal grammarians. To appreciate it, for get what you have been told about UG, principles, parameters, and the irrelevance of Saussurean arbitrariness, and observe that languages differ orthographically and phonetically in ways that are apparent to everyone. While the alphabet (A, B, C …) used might sometimes be the same, sounds and sound–mea ning pairings can differ radically from one language to another , even from one person to another . On many people's pronunciations, “red,” “rot,” and “rouge” do not even have the same initial r-sound. But if languages differ as radically as this alone makes it appear , it is difficult to make sense of how there can be mutual comprehension. An appealing answer to how there can be sufficient uniformity to allow und erstanding, yet great differences in how languages appear , is that languages differ at the ‘surface’ but are uniform at another , deeper level that has something to do with meaning an d thought. This sort of consideration drove the Port Royal grammarians. Lancelot and Arn auld acknowledged ‘surface’ differences in the sounds that appeared, but postulated a hidden, uniform level for meaning and introduced transformation-like rules to link the two. Chomsky acknowledged the parallel between his thinking and the Port Royalists' when he adopted Deep Structure as the locus of interpretation, saying that “base Phrase-markers may be regarded as the elementary content elements from which the semantic interpretations of actual sentences are constructed,” continuing: To say that formal properties of the base will provide the framework for the characterization of universal categories is to assume that much of the structure of the base is common to all languages. This is a way of stating a traditional view, whose origins can … be traced back at least to the Grammair e gén érale et raisonneée (Launcelot and Arnauld, 1660). (1965: 1 17; for discussion, see McGilvray , forthcoming) Another motivation amounts to the idea that what one finds in Deep Structures as they were understood in the mid-1960s are sentence-like entities that seem easier to interp ret than “Surface Structures.” They are not yet com plicated by optional transformations such as passive. They seem to provide relatively simple formal objects that look like logical fo rmulae and that might easily be mapped onto things and situations in the world. So it was tempting to think that at Deep Structure one could find much more nearly straightforward ‘correspondences’ between what is ‘said’, or declared, and circumstances. They seemed to of fer a relatively easy way to secure interpreta tions. Some of what Chomsky wrote might be taken to suggest that he was moved by this consideration too. There is, for example, the “ elementary content” remark quoted above, although it is not clear that this is how to understand it. There is also a note in (1957: 103, n.10): “Goodman has argued – to my mind, quite convincingly – that the notion of meaning of words can at least in part be reduced to that of reference of expressions containing these words … Goodman's approach amounts to reformulating a part of the theory of meaning in the much clearer terms of the theory of reference.” This might look like commitment to the idea that clarity about meanings comes when we have mappings from wo rd to world – to ‘correspondences’. But then Chomsky continues: “just as much of our [previous] discussion can be understood as suggesting a reformulation of parts of the theo ry of meaning that deal with so-called ‘structural meaning’ in terms of the completely non semantic theory of grammatical structure.” Structural meaning is what Chomsky now calls “(sentential) meaning” (formally , SEM) – even in 1957, a “completely nonsemantical” notion. Given this, he was saying only that reference seems to give a grip on language use – Wittgenstein's sense of “meaning,” which Chomsky now places in pragmatics. This do es not imply that the lingui stic entities (representations within the language faculty) used in reference are simple, or that they wear referents on their sleeves. Given that (1957) was written during a period when Chomsky thought that the end products of a derivation constituted the tools used in interpretation, that these were not simple, and that they did not somehow refer by themselves, the second motivation played no role in (1957), suiting only Chomsky's persistent view. Whether Chom sky was moved by this consideration in 1965 or not, though, it – plus perhaps the Po rt Royal one, and possibly others – proved compelling to other people. If Chomsky soon changed his mind about Deep Structure and returned to develo ping his persistent view, others did not. The idea that Deep Structure or perhaps something even more abstract is the apt place for semantic interpretation caught the imagination of many , including several linguists and philosophers with Fregean likings for the idea that sense (meaning) determines reference. Chomsky soon became embroiled in controversy with several linguists who could neither give up the idea that semantic interpretation applies at Deep Structure nor overcome their resentment that Chomsky had done so. The generative semanticists – including some of Chomsky's students, such as John Robert Ross – soon generalized their complaint to the claim that Chomsky did not leave enough room in his grammars for semantics or meaning. It was not always clear, however , what the controversy was about. And now , when it is evident that the language system was virtually ‘designed’ (with all the qualifications that this word needs) to produce complex concepts from lexical ones, it is hard to take seriously the charge that Chomsky's derivations/computations have nothing to do with meaning. C omputation and inclusiveness What determines the meaning of a sentence or expression? Let us say right away that for the purposes of the science of language, it is not a person who chooses words and how they are used. We are not speaking here of language users and language use, but of derivations or computations of sentential meani ngs/concepts from some ‘choice’ of lexical items. If this is so, the answer is reasonably straightforward: the meaning (linguistic conceptual contribution) of an expression is fixed by the intrinsic contents (semantic feature packages) of the lexical items or LIs that go into the derivation and the combinatory principles to which the LIs are subjected, assuming with Chomsky in most of his work that LIs are in some way assigned formal features that ‘say’ what they ‘do’ in a sentence/expression. The LI ship might occur twice or more in a single derivation, and in some instance end up in a derived sentence as a noun (with, say, formal features ACCUSATIVE, PLURAL) and another a verb with some set of features specifying tense, among other things. UG demands some UG-possible specification or another for verbs, nouns, etc. There can be and is disagreement about how and where in a derivation that spec ification is given, o r ‘choice’ made. On one possible view, mental dictionaries include LIs without formal features, and also a group of LIs that amount to formal features, either abstract (< pst > for past tense) or with a morphological ‘shape’ such as will. A sente nce's meaning then depends on what is inserted where in a derivation, yielding either garbage or interpretable expressions (some, perhaps, with a verb phr ase like “shipped several ships”). Chomsky (at least in 1995b: 236–9, and o ften elsewhere) seems to prefer a strategy for ‘cho osing’ formal features that places them in LI specifications themselves. Assuming so, he assumes further that a derivation begins 2 with a grouping of LIs he calls a “numeration.” These LIs can have various formal features. If an LI is an N, it can have any of a number of UG- permitted assignments of case (ACCUSATIVE, etc.) and number (SINGULAR, etc.). During the course of a derivation some LI with specific features is Selected (a technical term) and inserted in the derivation. I will not try to cho ose between Chomsky's dominant view or others. The important thing to keep in mind is that ‘choices’ be random. Given a ‘choice’, the results are determinate, although the result is perhaps garbage. However one conceives of the ‘choices’ made, Chomsky holds that a derivation shoul d respect what he calls an “inclusiveness principle.” The basic idea is that a derivation be determined entirely by the relevant principles and the LIs that ‘enter ’ the derivation with the ‘choices’ made. As he says in (C&M 61–2): Plainly , to the extent that language is a system in which the compu tation just involves rearrangement of what you've already got, it's simpler than if the system adds new things. If it adds new things, it's only specific to language. Therefore, it's more complex; therefore, you don't want it, unless you can prove that it's there. At least, the burden of proof is on assuming you need to add new things. So inclusiveness is basically the null hypothesis. It says language is just what the world determines, given the initial fact that you're going to have a recursive procedure. If you're going to have a recursive procedure, the best possible system would be one in which everything else follows from optimal computation – we're very far from showing that, but insofar as you can show that anything works that way, that's a success. What you're showing here is a property of language that does not have to be attributed to genetic endowment. His point here (as he continues later to indicate) is like the point that bees don't have to evolve a geneticall y based instruction set that tells them that if they are going to build hives, they should make them in polyh edral form. Nature determines that: those are the stable forms. The point is also related to the idea that the faculty of language is a modular system. Its operations proceed independently of other systems, where these operations are described by the principles of computation, presented in a grammar or theory of language as formal functions. In the case of the computations to the semantic interface, as we found out at the end of the last chapter , his view is that ideally, the computational principle in question is just Merge in its various forms. That view represents, of course, an extraordinary reduction in the number of ‘rules’ that were found in his early grammars. A gain, the lex icon Chomsky is not known for detailed contributions to lexicology , or for the study of individual lexical items, but his Minimalist Program sets an agenda for linguistics that not only assigns the lexicon a crucial role, but requires that the lexical items it lists have a particular shape. They must, as we have just seen, include phonological, formal, and semantic features that specify (given UG) how they contribute to linguistic processing. The formal features indicate , for instance, that something is an N, not a V, with all the obvious consequences – that the N will be assigned a case (nominative, accusative, or oblique), for example. Formal features include the inflectional features that specify what ‘moves’ will be made when this item is inserted in a linguistic compu tational derivation of an expression. That is Chomsky's view, at least as of (1 995b). I continue to assume it, because it is easiest to under stand and makes clear sense of what he has in mind by inclusiveness. Semantic features, let us assume, are simply carried through as a package or atom ic ‘unit’ from LI to the semantic interface. Assuming this has consequences. One likely consequence of assuming that semantic features remain inert in a package unless and until they reach SEM is that not all the features in a package need to turn out to be relevant or play a role in an interpretation. That would likely be the case for a metaphorical interpretation. For example, calling Harry the 4-year -old child a pig does not often get interpreted in a way that portrays him as a quadruped, but it does assign Harry some PIG features – perhaps omnivorous (or perhaps pizza-specific) greed.3 A related consequence is that there will likely be few, if any , determinate relations between the language faculty's semantic interface with a specific cluster of semantic features at a time and feature- by-feature reactions in the systems with which it ‘communicates’. Perhaps we will find determinate structure-based relationships between systems in the case of – for example – semantic ‘role’ assignments such as nominative, accusative, oblique, etc. But it is unlikely that the fine-grained features of specific conceptual characters will stand in one-to-one or even multiplexed relations to ‘input’ channels in the systems with which the langu age faculty communicates. If you insist on determinate relations of the fine-grained sort, you could explore the possibility of pruning features before they reach the interface. But that would, of course, complicate the computational procedure a very great deal – far too heavy a cost to pay . So to allow and underwrite flexibility of interpretation and avoid complication of derivation, I suggest adopting the “all features, untouched” option. It may, of course, turn out to be either misguided or plain wrong. But it looks reasonable at this poin t, given the alternatives, and it supports and helps makes sense of an aspect of creativity – specifically , the appropriateness typical ly displayed in creative use. It also has a further advantage. It helps explain the intuition that what is called “semantic compositionality” must proceed over atomic or indecomposable units. An account of semantic compositionality is an account of how the meaning of a sentence comes to be fixed by the meanings of its parts (here, LIs) and by specified compositional or computational principles. Let us assume that the compositional principles in question for the faculty of language are those found in the vario us versions of Merge. That in itself imposes strict conditions on an account of sentence meaning compositionality . Unless Merge also applies to specific semantic features – and there is no eviden ce that it does, and good reason against this view – Merge p rovides no way to manipulate lexical semantic features in the course of a derivation or computation. Stereoty pes, atomicity , and Fodor's misinterpretation of atomicity But are there theory-independent reasons to believe that sentential meaning compositionality requires atomic ‘meanings’? Jerry Fodor (1998) of fers well-known and compelling arguments in favor of lexical meaning atomicity , but comes up with an incorrect view of what atomic ity amounts to. He makes it a semantic (referential) notion, while it should be understood as syntactic. It is worth looking at the good and bad points of his argument. One of the most compelling of his arguments is based in his discussion of and rejection of the so-called “stereotype” account of concepts. The stereotype account proposes that concepts such as BIRD amount to clusters of features, where the features in question reflect various stereotype phenomena. Imagine you are asked to name a bird. If you are a resident of the US o r Canad a, it is far more probable that you will name a robin (which in North America is actually a thrush) than an emu or a penguin. This is an example of a stereotype phenom enon. The stereotype view of a concept is the view that your BIRD concept – your BIRD stereotype – has features such as ‘flies’, ‘ is mid-sized’, and so on. In effect, the proposal is that the features that make up the concept BIRD are properties of birds you are likely to name first when you are asked to name a bird, and – not surprisingly – properties of birds that you are most likely to find in your environment, to find pictures of in children's books, and so on. Move away from birds that fly, are mid-sized, found in the environment, and the like, and you will find that the number of times people in a North American population will quickly name or think of emus and dodos will approach zero. Fo r the stereotype view, then, a concept's group of features amounts to a listing of the properties of things in a class – here, the class of birds as these are usually thought in commonsense understanding to be – that are readily identified, quickly nam ed, and so on. These need not be actual properties of birds, of course. They need only be among the features that are characteristic of birds. Given a population and a specif ied set of properties, stereotype views do make reasonably good probabilistic predictions about how people will answer specific questions. But they are not particularly good proposals for finding the features of linguistically expressed concepts. They look like – and are – predictions concerning the use of concepts by people in environments. These predictions concern language use and concept application. Perhaps they can play a role in cataloguing and of fering evidence of some sort for a formal proposal concerning a concept's features, but one would have to be careful. Catalogues based on the listed features, along with the evidence for them, are skewed towards individual populations and environments, where a proper catalogue would have to aim towards universality , with system-allowable variation. The merits and demerits of the stereotype view aside, though, let us return to Fodor's compositionality-based argument for rejecting the stereotype view and defending his account of atomic lexical concepts. Is there a stereo type for THROTTLE, LUNK, STROKE, and thousands of o ther noun-like concepts, without even mentioning verb-like and adverb- like con cepts? Speaking for myself, I have none, and I cannot, then, expect to be able to produce a genera l theory of semantic compositionality that relies on stereotype specifications. Many people do, however , have stereotypes for MALE and NURSE. I do, although different contexts can prompt variations. But let us for the purposes of argument assume that there are popu lation-fixed stereotypes for these concepts. This is where Fodor asks us to cons ider whether anyone's stereotype for NURSE and MALE when co mbined in the phrase “m ale nurse” yields the stereotype for MALE NURSE. The answer appears to be “no.” There may be some cases where one can combine stereotypes to yield a plausible stereotype, but this is not one of them. Given this plausibl e intuition, he goes on to argue – plausibly , I think – that compositionality of sentential meaning cannot in general be compositionality of clusters of stereotype features. So far, so good. But then he begin s to go wrong. He uses this argument (and others he has to of fer) to claim that concepts cannot be complex. He holds, correctly , that compositionality of stereotypes does not uniformly and plausibly yield stereotypes. But he also thinks that on this ground, he has demonstrated that the conc ept HOUSE cannot have multiple semantic features in its concept- or mean ing-specification. This is his mistake. He can plausibly argue that compositionality of concepts cannot involve mucking around with specific semantic features. After all, we have already seen that there are arguments against that: syntactic compositionality should leave semantic features alone, since they are needed at a SEM interface to provide for variable and creative interpre tations. And he can plausibly argue that compositionality of sentential meanings must be compositionality of units, ‘atomic’ units, of a sort. But it do es not follow that lexical concepts are not themselves complex. We know how they can be while still allowing for compositionality of atomic units. All we need do is assume – as seems to be the case anyway – that compositionality is syntactic via Merge, where Merge pays no attention to what is in packages of lexical semantic features. It treats the features themselves as inert. Because of that, we can make sense of how sentences such as “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously” and endless numbers of other sentences come to have meanings, even though vast numbers of them turn out not to be meaningful – to not have any application or use. And we can also make sense of at least one aspect of creative use. It is not hard to diagnose why Fodor goes wrong. He is a representationalist. Because of this prior (and unjustified) assumption, he holds that the only way to get semantic compositionality is by semantic means – that is, semantic in the traditional sense, where the content (or ‘external conten t’ or ‘wide con tent’) of a concept is specified in terms of (he and other representationalist s suppose) the concept's referent(s), or their distinctive prope rty. He is aware of this, and it is why he tries to provide atomic (in this sense) concepts and at the same time stay natura listic. To do so, he introduces and relies on what he takes to be a naturalistic theory of denotation or reference. Concepts on his view arise from triggering by and in turn denote properties ‘out there’. Meaning compositionality is compositionality of properties ‘out there’, even if we have no idea of what these pr operties might actually be. But if we abandon represen tationalism and the failed semantic project it depends on, and simply assume on reasonable grounds that semantic compositionality requires only that the compositional p rinciples treat a complex of semantic features as an atomic unit, we can hold that concepts are fixed or individuated by their internal and intrinsic semantic features, and at the same time preserve the intuition that com positionality of meanin g is computation over atomic units. This point generalizes: if concepts were identified in terms of stereotype properties (even if they should not be on other grounds), or identified with clusters of any o ther sort of features, we could still have compos itionality of the synt actic so rt I mentioned. The issue is not whether concepts can be clusters of features but – if they are – what kind of features, and what kind of clusters. The stereotype view of concepts may be wrong for various reasons. But it is not wrong in the way Fodor's view is. The ‘atomicity’ of a package of semantic features is consistent with thin packages of features that underdetermine the uses to which the concepts can be put, or fuller packages of semantic features that provide many features that allo w for and invite multip le alternative interpretations. We have no good theory of semantic features and how they cluster on hand at the moment so cannot choose on established and tested grounds between these or other alternatives. We can, though, speculate on reasonable grounds. Let us assume that concepts identified as clusters of semantic features at least ‘guide’ the uses to which they are put. That suggests neither determination nor com plete freedom in interpretation, but it does indicate that specific interpretations can provide evidence for postulating specific features. Let us assume further that at least some aspects of concepts are shared across a population – perhaps even the whole human population. That is to be expected, given that while understanding what another says is always approximate, it is only rarely wild, and when it is wild, it could be due to sentence ambiguity rather than incomplete matches or even complete mismatches between semantic feature clusters. It is imp ortant, however , to also keep in mind that concepts can differ in some respects between individuals and groups of individuals in populations. Consider , for example, Hagit Borer's observation that English BITE and STING (used to describe various kinds of animal/insect attack) have no directly corresponding conceptual characters (conceptual “listemes” in Borer's terminology) in Hebrew (2005: 12). In English, dogs, snakes, and mosquitoes bite, while bees sting. In Hebrew, dogs bite while mosquitoes and bees sting. Snakes do neith er: they attack in quite a different way for which there is no English translation: they HIKIŠ. Clearly BITE and STING have a different way o f presenting situations and things than do their Hebrew analogues, and there is no analogue to the Hebrew snakebite concept in English. It is not difficult to find further examples, such as those mentioned at the beginning of this chapter . These considerations appear to eliminate the possible but unlikely view that a concept such as WATER can be identified with a sin gle feature, perhaps WATER. The single-property view wou ld not make sense of why – for example – a person who uses the concept WATER that appears in a sentence in a position for a noun expects samples of water to be liquid, or recognizes that when someone who puts a tea bag in a cup of hot water, the result ceases to be water and becomes tea, while nevertheless, when drawing someth ing from a tap connected to a municipal water system that purifies its water with massive tea bags, calls that stuff coming from the tap “water .” Features that allow for and make sense of these uses appear to be among the hidden features of WATER, assuming that it is the co mmonsense concept that is in question, not some invented scientific one. The considerations also seem to rule out the idea that semantic features could amount to a grab bag of various individual-specific features of ELEPHANT such as [admired by small tree frogs]. These supposed features might in a specific case help make sense of why a person happens to expec t small tree frogs to chirp with excitement in the presence of elephants, but it has no obvious merit other than this. It also undermines the otherwise plausible idea – at least for the internalist who seeks to explain how concepts appear to be acquired easily and automatically and also appear to be reasonably uniform over large populations – that there must be some kin d of mental machinery at work that yields at least some ‘core’ features for a specific concept, while allowing at least other more nearly peripheral o nes to enter too, perh aps by means of a different process such as association. That kind of compromise view is temptin g, and for purposes of this book, I propose adopting it – without, of course, hoping in doing so to cut of f further discussion and possible rejection of that picture. If that view is adopted, we make sense of a degree of uniformity in populations with similar acquisition triggers – perhaps in principle the same for all people everywhere – and also provide for a reasonable degree of variation, short, though, of individual-by-individual variation. The core features of WATER then might include [liquid], [phase changeable], [natural], and the like. More peripheral features might include [colorle ss], [incompressible], and so on. I do not propose this picture as a serious theory , only a reasonably plausible guess. Artifact concepts such as CHAIR might include not just [artifact] but functional features [for seating] among the core features, perhaps structural features [stable material] among the peripheral. There is considerable danger in proceeding this way: the features in question are expressed in everyday terminology , not theoretical, and the assignment of features suspiciously resembles aspects o f stereotype and of ‘properties of referents’ view of concept s. A proper theory must avoid these errors. But at this stage, perhaps stereoty pe and other , better accounts of feature clusters of fer useful hints to the would-be scientist of linguistically expressed concepts. Remember that while a computa tion might be fully determined, there will be choic es left up to the interp reting speaker and/or the other systems to which SEMs ‘speak’. Uses are not predetermined, only guided in part. Moreover , some lexical features allow for changes in emphasis and focus. The features of BOOK, for example, allow that this single lexical item, in its various possible configurations (accusative, nominative, singular , plural), can be ‘ read’ as referring to either a physical object or an abstract container of information, or both . In effect, they have a “take it any of these ways” feature, perhaps representable as [physobj·info] (which can be read very informally as physical-object-and-container -of-information-although- can-be-considered-under -only-one-aspect-as-in: “shred the book”). This alternation is also among the features of NEWSPAPER, JOURNAL, MAGAZINE, THESIS, WINDOW, etc. Arguably, in fact, all nouns have something like the feature [± abstract]. Chomsky remarks that “book” “can be used to refer to something that is simultaneously abstract and concrete, as in the express ion ‘the book that I'm writing will weigh 5 pounds’. That is a proper ty of a broad range of nominal expressions, perhaps all” (1995b: 236). Because o f it, one can speak of moving a flooded London to another location, which requires that London be conceived of as both a concrete entity (flooded as it is) that cannot in fact be moved, although, conceived as abstract, it can. No decision is made as computation begins; [± abstract] (in some fo rm) is a feature that migrates to SEM along with oth er semantic features of the lexical item, ob livious to various Merges (although words with which it co-occurs might serve to skew interpretations in o ne direction rather than another). At SEM it of fers a very useful special form of ambiguity that seems to be characteristic of natural languages. Chomsky suggests that the fact that something like [± abstract] may be among the features provide d by UG (or UG+) for all nominals is “one of the reasons why standard theories of reference are not applicable to natura l language” (1995b: 236). The point can be extended: SEM/LF need not meet the strict logical deman d of a consistency that would rule out something being considered both abstract and con crete at the same time. Logics – or at least, logicians – tend to dislike incompatible-looking features like these. But natural language users seem to thrive on them. It af fords yet more creativity . There are many other undecided issues concerning the lexicon and its features. I mention one of these issues. It concerns how certain forms of semantic co-gen eration, or “polysemy ,” are to be represented and placed in a comp utational system. Usin g some of James Pustejovsky's (1995) examples, a fast driver is very different from a fast game, a fast decision, or a fast book. Exp laining how to represent FAST's feature set in such a way that it can yield (or perhaps pick out) such different aspects of what counts as fast – depending on the con cept it ‘modifies’ – turns out to be a very difficult task. Is this to be und erstood as a matter for pragm atics? That appears to be a reasonable answ er, for – among other things – judgments of rate and speed are, like those of distance, subject to variability depending on circumstance . But there are some who try to deal with the matter as a part of the computational procedure. Ignoring these issues, the general picture sketched so far should be reasonably clear. Lexical items, which are clusters of features, enter the computational/compositional system, which produces boundless numbers of expressions, each of which includes a linguistic perspective (SEM). This view of meaning and its composition ignores relationships to things in the world. While the meaning of a lexical item might be related by a speaker who uses it to something in the world – by, for example, using a sentence with its meaning to speak about that thing – the fact that it is so related on an o ccasion of use is irrelevant to its meaning. If “Gertrude left before her dogs could get into the garbage” is used on an occasion by a person to refer to Gertrude, her retrievers, and the accumulation behind Jane's house, that is a matter for pragmatics, not for a theory of meaning. C homsky and C udworth on interpretation: “ innate cognoscitive power” and prolepsis If on e adopts na ture-assembled meanings in the head and propos es that they are used to deal with the world – that is, provide perspectives that we can use in various ways to deal with this world and others – ‘the wo rld’ and its things do not survive unscathed. Things are not just “out there,” waiting for us to inspect them. Like Goodman, Chomsky suggests that by using language human s ‘create’ worlds that reflect the cognitive capacities used to deal with them. That is Goodmanian constructivism. But Cho msky has a very different view of the tools with which worlds are made. Goodman is anti-nativist; Chomsky's natural language meanings are the pr oducts of a nativist engine. He says: “W e can think of naming as a kind of ‘worldmaking’, in something like Nelson Goodman's sense, but the worlds we make are rich and intricate and substantially shared thanks to a complex shared n ature” (2000a). To find others who have adopted worldmaking and rationalist nativ ist and internalist principles, one has to go back to Cudworth, Herbert of Cherbury, and Descartes. Chomsky's few suggestions about ho w the mind configures the world are often expresse d in quotes from Cudworth and other ratio nalists. This is no accident. Much of what Cudworth and the others had to say – with the exception of their reliance (perhaps someti mes pro forma) on God's aid – is easily constru ed in terms of SEMs as configuring tools that people use. Of course, Cudworth and others during his period would not have thought that commonsense ideas/concepts and what Chomsky calls SEMs (‘sentential meanings’, as a first app roximation) are in any way linguistic, nor did they have the theories on hand that indicated how these ‘entities’ are formed/grow . But they with Chomsky agree on certain basic assumptions, and on their implications for the application of concepts, or “interpreting.” The assumptions – all discussed and justified so far – are these: 1. Linguistically expressed commonsense ideas/concepts (lexical/phrasal/sentential) ‘grow’ and are innate in that sense. The same ap plies to sensory ‘concepts’, such as the colors humans experience. All originate in the mind, not the world outside. 2. Nothing in the world(s) of science need have any of the features that make up the characteristics (“characters”) of ideas/concepts. 3. Human s must interpret/‘see’/conceive the entities and events of the ‘world of experience’ (“lived world”/commonsense world) with their native concepts. (We also use (invented) concepts to ‘make’ scientific ones, which are not ‘experienced.’) Cudworth focus ed on the role of ideas/concepts such as HOUSE and WATCH (not the “ideas” of color and shape produced by the visual system) in what we now think of as perceptual judgment. Perceptual judgment is a way in which humans, who alone have the concept HOUSE, mobilize such concepts and on an occasion apply them in coordination with sensory features to produce what we think of as judgments (whether expressed out loud or not). The result is reference to something that we think of as ‘out there’ an d perceptual categorization: “That is a house,” “I hear a stream.” Cudworth wanted to make sense of how an innate internal concept such as HOUSE could bear on (be used to refer to) and seem to properly characterize som ething in the ou tside world, even though ‘out there’ in the world o f the sciences nothing has features such as [FIT FOR HUMAN HABITATION] (or colors) that interpretation through the innate concept of HOUSE assigns to it. To make sense of how the mind n evertheless produces experiences appropriate to circumstances that must be thought of as alien to such features, Cudworth produced his “proleptic” account of concept product ion and perceptual judgment. According to it, the mind generates ideas in the head as needed and, when it perceives , somehow manages to anticipate the circumstances and the appropriate use of the concept HOUSE. It effortlessly produces the feature [FIT FOR HUMAN HABITATION] (clustered with [MADE BY HUMANS/ARTIFACT], etc.) inside the head yet seems to ‘find’ it in things outside the head. A house is, in ef fect, ‘made’ by and through perception. In modern dress, we might say that the linguistically expressed concept HOUSE, along with sensory concepts such as colors, etc., partially configure ‘what we see’. Perhap s similar stories could be told about the role of HOUSE in imagined, remembered, anticipated, storied, etc. houses. Good perceptual judgment amounts not, per impossibile , to a matching or correspondence between inner concept and outer facts (as these are understood, presumably , in ph ysics, chemistry, and so on), but to the successful, by human standards, informing of perception or experience by the relevant concept. This is a restatement of Chomsky's point that innate ideas have proved successful in informing our anthropocentrically oriented experience of the world: commonsense understanding is proof positive of that. Our mind's concepts do seem to ‘anticip ate’ experience – or at least, to provide adequate resources such that they can be applied in ways that advance our interests. Lexical concepts and SEMs thought of as concepts clearly p rovide a means to cope with the environments that human beings encounter in their “ecological niche.” Saying that concepts anticipate experience, or ‘work’, when applied in perceptual judgment, does not pretend to be a theory of sensory ‘interpretation’. We already know that the prospects of a seriou s science of interpretation or use/application of language of any sort are dim, at best. It is a likely story – as Plato put it in his Timaeus – that rearranges intuitions about the appropriateness of inner ideas to outer circumstance for one kind of interp retive activity, that of p erceptual judgment, utilizing the concepts expressed in natural language s. It also suggests how to construe the appropriateness of speculation about what Harriet might do tomorrow , about how well a historical novel captures a time, and about how compelling a poem is – all ways in which linguistically judgment can be “appropriate to circumstances.” The likely story helps re adjust intuitions in order to take into account the fact that inner ideas must inform experience and the world – and imagined worlds too – rather than the other way around. Notice that agreement between people in commonsense perceptual and other judgments (assuming that there is such agreement) provides us not with the objectivity of the sciences, but with what might be called a “public” world. Its being shared has nothing to do with being in direct contact with things ‘out there’ and learning (with the aid of training) what their features are. It depends in stead on largely shared biophysical natures and sufficiently similar I-langua ges. We share sensory sounds and colors, plus thing- and category-concepts and basic combinatory principles, because of the biophysical basis of our minds and their machinery . One mo re remark underscores a related point made by rationalists such as Cudworth and Herbert of Cherbury. They argued that without innate conceptual and combinatory machinery we would not be able to develop ‘knowledge of the (commonsense) world’ and engage in reasonable inferences at all. To see this, consider one of the many ‘ca usal’ verbal concepts, PERSUADE. Chomsky often (e.g., 1988a) points out that from the correctness/t ruth of “x persuade y to z” follows the correctness/truth of “ y in tend to z”: if someone has persuaded someone else to do something, everyone knows that the persu aded person at least intends to do it. This inferential relationship constitutes knowledge that bears on fact (on the things of the wo rld – here, the commonsense one). But if Chom sky is right, this relationship between PERSUADE and INTEND, and thus the correctness of the inference from relevant sentences with the first to relevant sentences with the second, is not learned . No one has to learn it, for it lies in the semantic features of the structurally complex concept expressed by the lexical item “persuade.” There is plenty of evidence that the feature set characteristic of PERSUADE (which would, of course, be associated with different sounds in different natural languages) and INTEND, and the connection between them, are innate, for there is evidence that the concepts and the connection are recognized across the human p opulation. No child has difficulty automatically ‘pick ing up’ this complicated lexical item and thousands of others equally complex. ‘Persuade’, like a large class of other causative verbs that include SINK, WASH, BREAK, BLOW, and THROW, are conceived by our minds to include a causal relationship between an appropriate agent who does something and some state that is an ef fect of what the agent does. 4 In ef fect, the meanings of PERSUADE and related expressions underwrite the correctness of inferences like the above. We have in PERSUADE and like verbs many clear examples of what philosophers are fond o f calling “a priori knowledge.” And it is because we have this that we can develop “knowledge of the (commonse nse) world” and ways to make reasonable inferences about it. Relevance of the science of language to politics? The com binatory system of language provides humans with an endless conceptual resource that can guide use. Add to this the fact that guidance without determination provides lots of additional room for creativity; metaphor of fers endless examples. Given this, and given that language constitutes an important – perhaps the sole distinguishing – aspect of human nature, it should be no surprise that humans get satisfaction from exercising their creativity and freedom. A lot of that creativity has been turned to ‘real- world’ problem- solving, and among the problems that humans have to deal with are providing not just for their animal needs (sustenance and reproduction), but for distinc tively human needs too, such as the opportunity to exercise creativity and to cooperate in fulfilling ways with others in order to solve problem s. Among the tools that we have invented to deal with these kinds of issues are institutions – economies, villages, cities, states, systems of production, clubs, games, and the like. Because these are institutions, they are artifacts. If they are artifacts, they can be modified and molded by us to best solve these problems. There is nothing sacrosanct about the kinds of ‘representational democracies’, autocracies, nation- states, capitalist forms of economy , and institutions of aggression common in the world today . They can be, and need to be, judged by deciding how well they solve the problem of fulfilling needs. That is why some of Chomsky's political work has been directed towards constructing, and employing as an ideal, a model form of government with which to measure current institutions and practices. And to make sure that he is justified in of fering this model as an ideal, he has also tried to provide a nat uralistically based theory of human nature and the needs of creatures with this nature. The results are found in his co ntradictory-sounding “anarchosyndicalism” and “libertarian socialism.” We will find out what these amount to and what they can be used to do after lo oking at some major themes of Chomsky's political analysi s. Keep in mind, though, that this analysis and criticism are informed by what strives to be a naturalistically based assessment of human nature and its needs. Chomsky's scientific work and study of language and its role in cons tituting human nature inform and influence his political work. I try to explain how below . No tes 1 I am grateful to Oran Magal for these examples. 2 While I have described and will continue to describe a derivation as a temporal process that ‘begins’ with a number of LIs, keep in mind that Chomsky is not claiming that there is some actual temporal process of the sort. 3 Metaphorical attributions are no doubt easier to detect and interpret when the features assigned to the tar get (here, little Harry) are among the stereotypical features of the source (here, the concept PIG). (For an idea of what a stereotypical feature is, see below .) But nothing rules out metaphorical interpretations with non-stereotypical features. Interpretations, whether metaphorical or literal, are within the control of “other systems” and ultimately , the person who interprets: there is no science of interpretation. The issue at stake here in the discussion is that of deciding what features to assign to a lexical item, and – particularly important – how they come to be part of a person's mental lexicon. 4 To avoid possible confusion: this is not causation as under stood in the sciences. This is “rational causation,” as discussed above. 7 Cho msky o n Po litics: So me Basic Themes Focusing It is impossible to discuss all of Chomsky's political works. They encompass a wide range of issues: terrorism, racism, state religion, rights, freedom, authority , needs, political ideals, strategies, the cold war, nationalism, council communism, anarchism, libertarianism, revolution, morality , the market economy , US foreign policy , imperialism, the role of intellectuals, un ions, solidarity , friendship, managers, media, corporations, legal persons, and tribalism, to name some. Fortunately , there are recurring themes. Chomsky admits to being an anarchosyndicalist or libertarian socialist and has added considerable intellectual content and strength to this progressivist view. He reminds us that political decisions are made against a backdrop of assumptions about human nature, and opposes an ‘economic man’ view of human nature to the view he supports. He argues that his supposedly radical politics is in fact far more responsive to human nature and its distinctive needs than the currently popular ‘isms’ of co rporate-run democracies – for instance, neoliberalism. He defends the view that citizens of democracies in which large corporations control the economy – especially the United States – are subjected to a form of mind control or propaganda by corporate-run media, advertising and ‘public relations’ industries, and the publicized opinions of corporate-supported ‘think tanks’. He holds that the “free market economy” is anything but free, and that those who are most strident in their defense of ‘free trade’, such as the managers of large transnationals and their elected government representatives, benefit from protectionism, low-wage non-W estern manufacture, and welfare for corporations and the rich. “Mar ket principles” (subjecting one self to high risk, failure, job loss …) are to be honored by the poor , not the rich. He holds that the US invaded – committed deliberate aggressio n against – Vietnam, Iraq, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, and others. He holds that intellectuals are responsible for telling the truth in politics, although, he argues, few do; most conform to the wishes of power to gain reward. He criticizes the actions of both sides in the Arab–Israeli conflicts and exposes the role of the US in blocking settlement of the Palestine issue in a way that accords with long-standing and massive international opinion. His preferred long-term solution to the Palestine conflict is a binational state, but he compromises on a two-state solution. He provides ample evidence of US ‘exceptionalism’ – of exempting itself from moral and legal principles, considering itself a law of its own. He holds that US foreign policy has consistently , through the exercise of military and economic power (often through local ‘clients’, often dictators), worked to ensure that popular movements in developing countries that might be sufficiently effective to challenge the ‘ideals’ of a market economy are unsuccessful. He (201 1) calls this “saving a country fro m its population.” And there are several others. In this survey of Chomsky's political views, I drastically shorten even this relatively short list. I focus on three themes. One is the use and abuse of power and its (attempted) justification in government actions at home in the US and abroad, especially as exhibited in capitalist ideology . Another is Chomsky's acco unt of why people living in a democracy who nominally have the power to control their government and economy are persuaded to accept policies and decisions against their interests; this is called “the manufacture of consent.” The third is Chomsky's anarchosyndicalism, a sketch of an ideal form of social or ganization that he employs to measure the extent to which current social and economic systems fail, and to propose ways to improve them. I take up Chomsky's important form of justification for this ideal in the next chap ter. But I begin with some preliminaries concerning method and style. Chomsky's focus and style in political writing Chomsky does not cover every social and political issue, or deal equally with every part of the globe. This is surely no surprise: affairs of economy and state present an overwhelming mass of material, and he naturally emphasizes some themes and focuses on certain areas of the world to be effective in what he says. Nor in this regard should it be a surprise that he focuses much of his ener gy on the deeds and misdeeds of the US. Certainly since World War II, the US has been the primary hegemonic power (read “empire”), and its foreign polic ies and military and economic power have had a major influence on o ther states (Israel, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Colombia, Iraq, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Indonesia …), on the UN, on NATO, and on the policies and decisions of supposedly independent international eco nomic or ganizations such as the IMF, the WTO, and the World Bank. It has had unequalled influence, and through its military and economic power it still does and, for a while, at least, it will continue to. While Chomsky focuses his writing in the ways indicated and constantly changes his narrative to suit contemporary affairs, it is importa nt to notice that he is careful to place his discussion in an historical frame. He typically does so in a way that corrects in a well-documented way the ‘of ficial’ historical record written by the powerful to serve their interests. This allows him to engage in – as Irene Gendzier (20 05: 260) pu ts it – “histori cal retrieval.” Doing this, he shows how distant the professed ideals of those in power are compared to their actions, and deflates the professed intentions of the pow erful to serve the inter ests of those they oppress. It provides his readers with too ls of “intellectual self-defense” (Chomsky 198 9: viii, 426) . And it helps readers see that there is little that is new in political affairs: actors in the American Empire are little different than those in the British, for example: the behaviors, attitudes, and ‘justifications’ repeat. Because he is so critical of the policies of power and empire an d of those who exercise them, Chomsky has a prudential reason for care in his data and claims. If his data were faulty, he would be subjected to immediate efforts to discredit his integrity , resources, scholarly efforts, and so on. Remarkably, given the thousands upon thousands of citations his works contain, I know of very few cases where he has been correctly faulted for providing misin formation or for misquoting. Despite this, he notes that one famous instance has been the subject of (literally) dozens of articles, “proving” that nothing I say can be trusted, that I'm a conscious liar, that nothing from the left can be trusted, etc. In the first printing of American Power and the New Mandarins , I attributed to Truman himself a very close paraphrase of Truman's remarks given by James Warburg. In the second printing, a few months later, it's corrected. (personal communication, April 15, 1998) There are very few other examp les. By contrast, those who criticize him often do not bother quoting his work or quote out of context, distort, and create straw men that cannot be supported by Chomsky's text. His care is also motivated by another , more important factor . He feels that as an intellectual concerned with political and moral social issues and endowed not only with a prodigious memory but with well-ho ned tools of analysis and or ganization, he has a responsibility to provi de accurate information on matters of concern to people. “What I'm trying to do is simply p rovide the kind of service to popular dissident movements and scattered individ uals that any person who has the resources, the privilege, the training, etc. should perform” (1988b: 775; see also 1996 and 2010). This is part of the task of the responsible intellectual. Sometimes criticism calls Chomsky's credentials into question: it is said that he's not an expert on political and social matters. The answer to this form of attack should be: politics is not science, but a domain of concern where we all can and do rely up on a massive number of shared assumptions and concerns about persons, their hopes, their projects, and their interests. We already know Chomsky's op inion of claims of expertise in this domain. In Language and Politics he puts an iron ic cast on his point: “I don't think international affairs are harder [than sport commentaries and ‘expertise’ in analyzing a team's play and chances against others]. I don't think that national security policy is intellectually more challenging … That's a pretense of the social sciences – that they're dealing with deep ly complex issues that are beyond the level of the ordinary person. That's mostly fraud” (1988b: 717). The fraud, Chom sky holds, is that intellectuals – among others, those in the social sciences and the media – pretend to objectivity and to telling the truth, but too often actually participate in a very effective form of thought control. The in telligentsia, “which include historians and other scholars, journalists, political ‘commentators’, and so on, undertakes to analyze and present some picture of social reality. By virtue of their analyses and interpretations, they serve as mediators between the social facts and the mass of the population: they create the ideological justification for social practice” (1979: 4) . They serve (to use some more of his terminology) as members of an intellectual “priesthood.” (So-called “public intellectuals” are often in this group.) But the priesthood is not needed. “In the analysis of social and politic al issues it is sufficient to face the facts and to be willing to follow a rational line of argument. Only Cartesian common sense, which is quite evenly distributed, is needed” (1979: 5). Typically , that information is denied through lack of opportunity , often aided by propaganda-induced apathy , redirection of interests (celebrities, entertainment …), and ennui induced by limited choice, fatigue, and many other factors. The social scienc es generally , and above all the analysis of contemporary affairs, are accessible to anyone who wants to take an interest in these matters. “The alleged complexity , depth, and obscurity of these questions is part of the illusion propagated by the system of ideological control, which aims to make the issues seem remote from the general population and to persuade them of their incapacity to or ganize their own affairs o r to understand” (1979: 4–5) the social and political domain where genuine democracy correctly assumes that they should make decisions – so long as they are properly informed. The responsible intellectual tries so to inform. Irresponsible ones serve the interests instead of the state and corporate religion. And fina lly, a note about style: as indicated, Chomsky often uses irony in his work. His (2010), for example, is replete with it. There is a lesson in that: iro ny work s only if your audience is aware of the correct story . It would do no good for an expert in physics' string theory to use irony in her talk to me; I would not recognize the irony . But it is quite easy to detect irony in the commonsense dom ain. And it is effective: it gets the audience involved in the assessment of the truth of claims made and arguments given, exercises their critical capacities, and places them on the path of participation, rather than as passive consumers of what is often misinformation. Power and its abuse Power and ideology: ‘ economic man’ The issue of power – its nature, roles, and justifications – recurs in most of Chomsky's political themes and writings. One way to come to understand his polit ical views and their motivations is to see what he has to say about power and its justification. In his discussion s of power and its exercise, Chomsky always raises the question of justification. And he supposes that ultimately, answers to the question of whether someone, o r a corporation, or a governmen t is justified in choosing to exercise authority or power depends on a conception of human n ature an d its fundamental needs. Sometimes it is easy; he remarks (1996) that he would be justified in using power to keep his grandchild from running into traffic. Here, survival clearly trumps autonom y, and there is no reason to criticize, unlike the fear-mongering efforts of a Ronald Reagan government telling the citizens of the US that they should fear an invasion from Nicaragua. Generally , it is very difficult to justify the exercise of power and authority in cases involvi ng social, economic, and political coercion and limitation, especially where the institutions involved have questionable legitimacy. It is not just that the cases become more complex. It is due also to the fact that one enco unters competing yet equally ill-founded views of what is right and of rights and legitimacy. Getting answers to questions of justification and legitimacy in this sphere require s, at the least, a clear view of human nature and its needs, and especially , a view that can itself be justified. For that purpose, obviously , faith and stipulation will not do; objectivity and evidence are needed. The only plausible way to get that kind of justification is to construct a natural science – presumably biologically based – of the natures of humans, and in particular , of distinctive human characteristics and the needs they engender . The nature and prospects of such a theory are taken up in the next chapter . It is enough for the moment to no tice that the credentials of favored pictures o f human nature such as those built into the view of humans as “economic man” discussed below are dubious, and need justification. When n oted MIT economist and Nobel prize winner Paul Sam uelson's book Economics was the standard text in under graduate economics courses in the US, Chomsky quoted from it to illustrate some of the assumptions built into the then-reigning and still dominant version of “economic man” on which neoliberal and neoconservative dogmas rest. He noted that when Samuelson spok e of the range of possible economic systems, he simply assumed that the spectrum was defined by freedom from state constraints on explo itation on one side and complete government control on the other . He saw a “spe ctrum with complete laissez fair e at one extreme and ‘totalitarian dictatorship of production’ at the other .” Assuming this scale, Samuelson concluded: “ ‘the relevant choice for policy today’ is to determine where along this spectrum our economy should p roperly lie” (Chomsky 1971: 62; the in ner quotes are from p. 39 of Economics ). Chom sky continues: “There are other dimensions, however , along which Samuelson's pola r opposites fall at the same extreme: for example, the spectrum that place s direct democratic control of p roduction at one pole and autocratic control, whether by state or private capital, at the other” (1 971: 62). The same poi nt is taken up in “Some Tasks fo r the Left,” reprinted in Radical Priorities . There, Chomsky notes: The assumption s that guide the mass of [economic and political] scholarship hardly differ from those expressed in manifestoes of the American ruling elite, for example the report of the study group on Political Economy of American For eign Policy , which identifies “W estern civilization” with capitalist forms (as contrasted to the collectivist deni al of freedom, initiative, and progress) and defines “the aim of economic activity in the West (as) the maximization of money income – in one or another of its forms – by individuals through the investment of capital or labour on one's own account or for , and under the direction of, others.” (1981b: 2 26; inner quotes from a report from the Woodrow W ilson Foundation and National Planning Association) Chomsky comes to his point: surely this concept of economic man is a psychological and moral absurdity which leads to untold suffering for those who try to mold themselves to this pattern, as well as for their victims. “Look out for number one” is a prescription for demoralization, corruption, and ultimately general catastrophe, whatever value it may have had in the early stages of industrialization. Cooperation for the common good and concern for the rights and needs of others must replace the dismal search for maximization of personal power and consumption if the barbarism of capitalist society is to be overcome. (ibid.) “Economic man ” is a distortion of human nature, and (by implication) the concept of freedom that this conception of human beings presup poses is not that of the “free and creative use of one's capacities” but only the lack of constraint against exploitation that corporate entities desire, or what Chomsky calls “accumulation and domination” (1996: 77). Assuming a different concep tion of humans and their needs, both Samuelson's “polar opposites” are at the same extreme. Both represent autocratic or clearly non-democratic forms of contro l of capital; they differ only in whether the control of capital is private or state-based, as neither puts control in the hands of the peo ple, those who actually do the work, rather than those who would manage – and use – others. Samuelson's con ception of economic man has some roots in Jo hn Locke and Adam Smith and their views of humans and their needs and rights, but is due pr imarily to Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo. In 1690 Locke held that the pursuit of fortune (property) is, along with life and liberty, among the basic rights o f human beings. Smith, in 1776, thought that human nature shows a “propensity” to “truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another” (An Inquiry into the Natur e and Causes of the Wealth of Nations , bk I, ch. 2); for Smith this propensity , along with reason and speech, distinguishes human beings from beasts. But – as Chomsky sometimes emphasizes to undermine the ‘liberal’ claim that Smith is the parent of current doctrine – Smith himself held in contemp t “the ‘mean’ and ‘sordid pursu its’ of ‘the masters of mankind’ and their ‘vile maxim’ ” (Chomsky 1996: 77). It was only in the nineteenth century with Ricardo and Malthus that accumulation and domination became the critical aims for defining economic values and modern neoliberal economic doctrine with its assumptions about humans and their needs and rights. Classical liberal economic doctrine valued freedom and the opportunity for individuals to find fulfillment of their natures in their creative labor , rather than the work-to-survive labor common today that often deman ds that both partners in a marriage work to survive. Labor of this sort is, in ef fect, a form of “wage slavery .” Economic man conceived of in terms of accumulation and domination has thrived in US ideology and justification of government actio n since the Reagan administration (in the UK, after Margaret Thatcher), but among those with power and wealth it has in various forms been an important part of US economi c and political faith from the beginning. James Madison, fourth president of the US, put the “rights of property” ahead of the rights of persons, holding that the rights of property must take precedence because the rights of property will consta ntly be under threat from “the will of the majority ,” who may, by their power in a democracy , “trespa ss on the rights of a minority” … The rights of the “opulent mino rity” that government must protect as its primary duty are … quite unlike “the rights of persons”; the latter are to be granted uniformly under the Constitutional system, whereas “the rights of property” are narro wly held in the hands of the “opulent minority .” ( Chomsky 1996: 1 18) This rhetoric is confusion: prope rty has no rights, people do. So Madison is saying that the rich have the right to be rich. To guarantee that this not be challenged, only the wealthy may run a government; this is only fair because, as Madison says, property “chiefly bears the burden of government.” It is clear where Madison's emphasis is among the three rights Locke assigned to all pe ople. And it is clear whose liberty, and of what sort, is to be taken seriously . In fact, in the US's early days, the right to life was also denied to some citizens, as it was in industrial England, in accordance with Malthus's view that someone who is not independently wealthy and does not survive in the labor market has “no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and , in fact, has no business to be where he is” (1996: 89). In this regard, Chomsky ironically mentions Ricardo on the market economy's devotion to the “happiness of the people.” The people are the rich: only they should be allowed to vote, for “ ‘limiting the elective franchise to the very narrowest bounds’ would guarantee more ‘security for a good choice of representat ives’.” To be sure, some ot hers might generously be allowed to vote – “ ‘not, indeed, … all people, but … that part of them which cannot be supposed to have any interest in overturning the right of property’ ” (1996: 89–90). There were dissident voices from the start – virtually all of them genuine conservatives, unlike today's ultra-right conservatives, who should be classified as reactionary statists. In his later years Thomas Jefferson, third president of the US, recognized that democracy was in danger if the “aristocrats” (the bankers and rich (his class); now: corporations and their ‘managers’) were allowed to take all powers unto themselves, establishing a plutocracy rather like that favored by James Madison. Jefferson came to prefer the true democrats who – like Chomsky – trusted people, who, with their commonsense capacity to solve problems and cooperate, could deal with matters of economy and state by themselves. Contemporary examples might include Evo Morales of Bolivia (2010: 70–1); very few examples can be found in the US Congress or elsewhere in the government. Furthermore, Jefferson declared, “widespread poverty and concentrated wealth cannot exist side by side in a democr acy” (Chomsky 1996: 87–8), which says something about corporate-run ‘democracies’ such as that found in the US. I return to that. Jefferson's views echo Enlightenment emphasis upon a crucial connection between free and creative labor and self-development and self-worth. As mentioned, Smith – unlike Malthus and Ricardo – recognized this connection and the constraints it introduces when he wrote: The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects are perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur . He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becom es as stupid an d ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become … But in every improved and civilized society this is the state into which the labour ing poor , that is, the great body of the people, must necessarily fall, unless government takes some pain to prevent it. ( Inquiry , bk 1, ch. 2) These classical liberal seeds of a state concerned for the welfare of all its citizens had a mixed reception in the nineteenth century . Along with steady growth of the ne w “manufacturing aristocracy” that worried de Tocqueville, one also finds a labor movement that honored Enlightenment ideals and a Republican Party that saw wage labor as chattel slavery where the laborer is seen as property . While the ‘laws’ of the market and the acceptance of domination in the form of wage slavery did not completely control domestic policy fo r most of the period, matters began to change near the end of the nineteenth centu ry with the corporatization of the US – som ething that Jefferson, Smith, and other Enlightenment thinkers did not anticipate. Greatly aided by the creation early in the twentieth century of advertising and PR industr ies and by judicial and legislative creation o f rights for corporate entities (free speech much more powerful than that afforded individuals, prot ection against search and seizure, plus limited liability and in recent years virtual indemnity against loss), corporate power continued to grow . From the advent of corporatization through the twentieth century , with the exception of a period after the Depression when welfare policies were int roduced as part of the New Deal, and apart too from advances in some human rights legislation after that, corporatization has generally increased, justified – when it is – by appeal to neoliberal ideology and its spawn: the myth of free markets, the voodoo of trickle-down (“supply side”) economic s, and its like. Especially from the Reagan years on, these US domestic accommodations to Enlightenment ideals of free labor and self-fulfillment, equality of opp ortunity , and democratic principles suffered some serious setbacks. Here are some indications: the stagnation in adjusted dollars since the 1970s of the wages of laborers, the greater privatization of public in stitutions, the erosion of corporate regulation, the increasing power of the corporation over the poli tical process, increased ‘defense’ spending, increased poverty rates, reduction in taxes for the rich and super rich, the virtual demise of labor unions in industry and (especially recently) the public sector , and – perhaps mos t of all – the extreme disparity in net worth (net marketable assets less net debt) between rich and poor . According to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances , in 2004, the top 1 percent in net worth held 34.3 p ercent of all wealth and the top 5 percent, 59.9 per cent. Shockingly , the bottom 40 percent held only 0.2 percent. The situation was bad enough for the average US citizen and wage earner in 2007 – the year before the housing bubble burst. But it was considerably worse by 2010. That is because the worth of the rich househo ld declined much less during the recent recession than the worth of the median US household. Edward W olf f in (2010) with still-tentative figures estimates that the wealth of the rich declined by 1 1.1 percent, but that of the median household, 36.1 percent. There are at pr esent some signs of grass-roots resistance to neoliberal ideology and its effects: the ‘Occupy’ movement, increasing industry- directed union activity, and the like.1 But aside from these, there is little indication that things are going to change quickly . At the time I write in 2012, an assessment of Barack Obama's performance for his first term might plausibly conclude that his views were at best like those of moderate Republicans during the Richard Nixon years, and at worst fully in line with the fina ncial industry that essentially bought him his position. His ‘universal’ health plan is resisted, but rarely for the good reason that it is largely a gift to the insuran ce industry , not a single-payer system. Republicans remain in control of the US Congress and are far further right now than they were during the Nixon era. And a conservative-dominated US Supr eme Court that on pape r disparages political activism has engaged in extraordinary political activism in favor of privilege and power by choosing presidents and giving corporations yet more power over the vote. The Jan uary 2010 decision of the Court that eliminated century-long restrictions on corporate spending provided the CEOs and boards of directors the power to by their own decision spend corporat e money in support of or against political candidates. That is, of course, in addition to the massive power which corporations already had available to them in campaign fundi ng, lobbying, and threat of moving industries from a politician's constituency . There is ample evidence of the pernicious effects on individu als of the conception of economic man we have been investigating. In addition to Smith's remarks and the evidence of the craftsperson or machine operator that can take pr ide in the work they do – pride that is encouraged by the respect and admiration of others – there is the evidence of greater longevity for those with fulfilling jobs, less depression, less absenteeism , improved products and production, and the like. Especially again since the 2008 crash and a bailout that favored the financial industry that caused it, we see evidence of the opposite. On the face of it, a better form of social or ganization than that of fered by neoliberal ideology is needed. Power and democracy: Madison and Jefferson Western democracies with capitalist economic control are not true democracies in which individuals have the capacity to make decisions in all aspects of their p ersonal and social lives. The attitude towards the ‘common man’ fou nd in capitalist-run democracies is that exhibited in what Chomsky in (1996) portrays as that of Madison, as opposed to that of Jefferson, at least in his later years. The difference is not due to differences in their social status: both were members of the agricultural and merchant elite in the early days of the US, and Jefferson in particular not o nly kept slaves, but fathered children with one. An d as with many attributions of beliefs and attitudes to individuals, the difference was not black and white: Madison too in later years appears to have softened his attitude. Yet there was a difference, and it underlies what is for our purposes a crucial difference in their views of democracy . As n oted, Madison placed the rights of property ahead of the rights of persons, and favored a governm ent structure that would protect the ‘rights’ of wealth. He got a democracy of that sort: only propertied white males could vote. A Madisonian democracy is one in which wealth controls economic and social policy . In current democracies, of course, many more can vote: in effect, any citizen who has reached a certain age. But the US and other capitalist democracies remain Madisonian. The economy is in the control of corporations, an d because economic power can be (and is) used to influence public decisions with advertisements and PR (the topic of the next section), to control politicians through lobbying and threat, and to take control of public or ganizations (privatization in education, etc.), Western capitalist forms of democracy remain firmly Madisonian. Jefferson, as earlier remarked, came to recognize that democracy was in danger if the “ar istocrats” (the large landholders, bankers, and mercantilists of the time) who “fear and distrust the people” were allowed to take all powers to themselves. He prefe rred the democrats who “identify with the people, have confidence in them, cherish and consider them as the honest & safe, altho not [always] the most wise depository of the publ ic interest.” Furthermore, he declared, “widespread poverty and concentr ated wealth cannot exist side by side in a democracy” (Chomsky 1996: 87–8). Jefferson's remarks echo Enli ghtenment emphasis upon a connection between free and creative labo r and self-development and self-worth, a connection for which there is still a wealth of evidence. A true democra cy in which all have a real say even in public economic policy – the kin d of democracy that Chomsky's anarchosyndica lism that is outlined below represents – is a very long way of f, and may in the final analysis remain only a valuable but unachievable ideal. A more achievable goal wo uld be one where the go vernment at least places limits on the power of the wealthy – for current and immediate purposes, legislation that provides government regulation and monitoring of financial institutions and industries, along with safeguards against monopoly , pollution , predatory practices, and unnecessary risks, among other things (1996). While controls of this sort were from Reagan on eliminated or weakened to the point of being useless, they did exist, and so are with effort achievable. An or ganized public can use the degree of control it now has in voting to achieve at least this in the short term, turning to longer -term goals later . Chomsky has argued at length that the concept of economic man discussed earlier and found in its purest form in neoliberal domestic and foreign p olicy in stituted in the US is far of f track. This is his pr imary point in Failed States (2006b). Writing during the G. W. Bush administration, Chomsky must have been tempted by the irony of the use of the term “failed state” by several in that administration when they used it to label Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Syria, or some other enemy of the day . Anyone who encounters the term is likely to think that a failed state is one that does not measure up in some dimension or another . Ordinary citizens of a state would probably when prompted come up with a short list of at least minimal ways in which a state should be measured. On that list would be a reasonable degree of security and provision against injury from within and without the state (2006b: 38). That would be an absolute minimum, reflecting the state's role in providing for survival. Then, depending on the resources that the state has available, its production capacity , the degree of advancement of its industry , and the like, the list could expand to an economy that provides for something more than mere survival, and – certainly in a state with the resources of the United States – provision for health care and income loss, guarantees of reasonable working conditions, opportunity for self-development, and so on. A list of ben efits that a successful state should provide is found in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.2 By these measures, Iran even in its current form is plausibly less of a failed state than the US. The US under Bush II invaded Iraq on a pretext that was patently false to anyone willing to listen to UN weapons inspect ors in Iraq and other evidence, and the US did so when it was clear to anyone not caught up in the rhetoric that invading would lead to a great increa se in terrorist activities, thereby increasing the threat to US citizens. Worse, the evidence of ignored information that could have prevented the crimes of 9/1 1 ind icated that the Bush administration was not being responsib le in considering threats to its territory and its citizens. Iranian citizens, on the other han d, were and plausibly still are subject to the worse threat of outright invas ion. Bush II and company were clearly considering invasion, prominent Israelis were encouraging just such action, and still are at the time of writing, and it is clear to all Arab states in the Middle East not only that Israel needs little pretext to invade, but that Israel has atomic weapons, the stronge st military establishment in the region, and the support of the US. In these circumstances, an ef fort on the part of Iran to develop atomic weapons as a deterrent serves the interests of its citizens, where the Bush administration from a very different position across an ocean and with great power available does not. Iran on this reading sought and seeks to imp rove its citizens' security; the US under Bush did not. And as the Obama administration's continued refusal to consider the option of turning the Middle East into a n uclear-free zone – or even to acknowledge publicly that Israel does have nuclear weapons and constitutes a serious threat to other Middle East nations – indicates, the only things that have changed are Iran's increased nuclear efforts, and increased US–Israeli (and now Canadian under a Harper government) demonization of its policies. I am well aware that Iran is by many measures a failed state; North Korea is worse , with an even more autocratic government that doe s not even appear concerne d about the security of the citizens. But the appropriate measures to apply to a state at a time are those based on what the state could accomplish in the circumstances it is in, not some universally applicable benchmark. And by both the minimal measure and the fuller ones out lined in the Declaration, the US in its current neoliberal phase is a failure, where Iran is a (very qualified) success. Much greater successes are found in South American states such as Venezuela and Bolivia . And – by now it should be no surprise – their success at providing for citizens, Chomsky points out, appears to have depended on breaking out of the restrictions of the neoliberal eco nomic policies that had been imposed upon them by the US directly, or in directly through the IMF and other such agencies. That is a recurrin g theme in (201 0), and the specific focus of its chapter 3 , where Chomsky addresses the evidence of fered by differences in degree of development and performance in making the good life possible under neoliberal and socialized regimes. Summarizing, on economic development overall during the advent of the US's turn to neoliberal policies in the mid 1970s, we find: Reviewing the neoliberal experience of the preceding quarter century , a study of the Center for Economic and Policy Research finds that it has been accompanied by slower rates of growth and reduced progress on social indicators – the most meaningful measure of social health. That holds fo r countr ies from rich to poor . … Robert Pollin found that “the overall growth pattern is unambiguous … there has been a sharp decline in growt h in the neoliberal era relative to the developmental state period” that preceded, a decline of over half, a “downward growth trend [that] is even more dramatic” when measured per capita, with increase in inequality and little or no reduction of poverty (when China, which rejected the neoliberal policies, is excluded), and devastating side effects among the most vulnerable. … In brief, the twenty-five years of economic sover eignty , state-coo rdinated economic growth, an d capital controls under the Bretton Woods system led to better so cial and economic results than the following twenty-five years of neoliberalism. (83–4) The poin t is emphasized when speaking of technological advances, many of them made in the US. With very few exceptions, they cannot be attributed to neoliberal policies and corporate investment in research, but to ‘nanny state’ support of a ‘def ense’ industry produced at public expense and later simply given to priva te power – which then produce s consumer goods based on the technologica l advances and charges the public for them (85f). In this regard Chomsky ironically mentions Alan Greenspan, who, praising the miracles of a market based on entrepreneurial initiative and consumer choic e, gave as examples of these miracles the internet, computers, information processing, lasers, satellites, and transistors. With the exception of transistors – produced by Bell Telephone Labs (which had at the time a government-guaranteed monopoly and thus government subvention of a significant sort) all the items Greenspan listed are “textbook examples of creativity and production taking place substantially in the public sector , mostly in the Pentagon, in some cases for decades, with consumer choic e approximatel y zero during the crucial developmental stages an d entrepreneurial initia tive mainly at the marketing end” (87). The irony is particularly poignant when one places Greenspan's claims in the context of Reagan's and later Republicans' declarations of ‘f ree market’ principles: Reagan not only imposed highly protectionist measures, but increased the ‘defense’ budget, initiated ‘Star Wars’ at public expense, and – like Bush II especially – created heavy public debt to pay for his ‘initiatives’. Neo liberals sing the praises of a free market, but rely on the state to provide them profit, and to bail them out when they fail. Chomsky's (1996) and many other works chronicle the saga of corporate welfare. Another princip le of neoliberalism is privatization. By definition, Chomsky points out, it is contrary to democracy , for it removes services from the public sector and pub lic control and places them in the private. The argument is efficiency but – as the US's privatized health care system that is by reason able measures twice as inef ficient as public sector systems in other countries shows – the ar gument is a sham. Chomsky adds one more principle of neoliberalism: financial ‘liberalization’. The results, from the reduction of currency and capital controls beginni ng in the 1970s through those introduced by Clinton in the 1990s, are clear: massive speculation, the need for governments to build greater reserves, shifting produc tion of goods developed with p ublic funds of fshore, and, of course, the failures of unregulated banks making irresponsible loans, creating financial chaos. Neoliberals continue to claim that ‘fre e markets’, deregulation , and so on, benefit everyone. That should be a surprise only when many who suffer from the institution of its principles echo it. On the evidence, people need a better form of economy and – with it – a better form of political or ganization. I outline Chomsky's outline of such an economy and form of social or ganization in the final section of this chapter . Foreign policy, imperial ambitions, and military power I discuss here briefly a related theme, a relatively recent factor in advancing the US's imperialist ambitions . The US has long had such ambitions; plausibly , they constitute the core of US foreign policy . They were exhibited in early US territorial expansion through purchase (Louisiana Territory and Alaska) and conq uest (the Mexican–American War). Had it not been for British power in 1812, the US would include Canada. And these ambitions were displayed in the 1823 Madison Doctrine expressing the US policy o f hegemony in its hemisphere, in Teddy Roosevelt's Great White Fleet, in the ‘idealist’ Woodrow Wilson's invasion of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and the like. But it was not until after World War II, when the US was the only combatant with an intact indust rial base and a massive war machine along with tremendous resources, that the US could turn its imperial ambitions into an effort to establish econom ic hegemony over as much of the world as it could. This effort became an explicit policy of the US government, outlined in the declassified 1950 National Security Council report #68, which instituted a policy of “Grand Area” politics (Chomsky 1989). The basic ro le of the military remain ed the same (aggression and intimidation), but its primary raison d’être became economic hegemony . The name of the Department of War was changed to the Department of Defense, a rather transparent effort at masking its role and new primary purpose. The ‘defense’ industry continued to receive massive government funding, at public expense. The beneficiari es of this spending were not the taxpayers who fun ded it, but corporations – not just the war industry , but others too which now could count on government-funded research (as mentioned before) as well as government-assisted access to foreign resources with no or minim al extraction restrictions, cheap workers with no unionization, and foreign markets. The US became (and remains) the world's single greatest purchaser of arms and greatest supplier of armament. It has maintained a military machine that with direct and incidental costs (such as ongoing medical resources for injured soldiers, ‘national security’ costs, and payments of the debts (and interest) incurred in G. W. Bush's wars) constitutes at least 28 percent and by some estimates over half of the US annual budget. A considerable part of ‘foreign aid’ was and is in the form of war materials (as with Israel and Colombia); the CIA and the State Department directly participated in the control of foreign governments (Chile, Indonesia, El Salvador , among many other cases); and as the US invasions of South Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan demonstrate, the US has not been shy about carrying out direct aggression wherever its interests (not defense but economic hegemony) are challenged. Chomsky's writings are full of examples and documentation. I will be very selective. The Korean War and the Vietnam invasion, along with military aid to Indonesia with its slaughter of some half a million communists in 1965 and eventual invasion of East Timor , not to mention the establishment of military bases in the region, furthered the US's aim of curbing Chinese ambitions and maintaining access to and control over the resources of Southeast Asia (1996). Heavy aid for a repressive regime in Egypt, massive military aid an d support for Israel and its expansionist policies (1983/1999, 1996, 2010), military aid and encouragement of Saddam Hussein and his campaign against Iran in the 1980s (1996), and the subsequent two invasions of Iraq were aimed at maintaining US control of oil resou rces, along with preventing any serious threat of a cooperative union of the Arab states in the region. Partly due to US over -extension in the Middle East and an economy weakened by reductions in regulation of the financial industry by Nixon (who got rid of GATT and the gold standard), Reagan, Clinton, and Bush, there are only recen tly serious challenges to US hegemony ove r South America (2010). They are found in the effor ts of Venezuela, Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil, and even for a while Paraguay to establish regional and autonomous economies. That is a new chapter in US imperialism. Earlier – as with Vietnam, Nicaragua under the Sandinistas, and Cuba – indigenous economies and governments that provided benefits to the local population were seen (correctly) as examples to ot hers that challenged US neoliberal dogma and US imperial ambitions, and were suppressed or eliminated. The efforts of go vernment and industry along with a compliant corporate- run media to direct massive public money to ‘defense’ have so far been very successful. The tail-wag-the-dog scare tactics and demonization of various foreign countries on the parts of various US administrations have contributed, however ludicrous the claims might be. The specter of an attack o n Texas by Sandinista-run Nicaragua using outdated jets that the legitimate Sandi nista government hoped to buy for the obvious purpose of defense against US-supported Contra forces is one example. As for the case where John F. Kennedy asked Mexico for support against the threat of a Cuban invasion , the then-president of Mexico declined, pointing out that the population of Mexico would die laughing at the idea that the US was threatened by a Cuban invasion. He forbore to mention that Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, Chile, and Mexico itself would be perfectly justified in fearing US invasion. The fright propaganda continues. During the Bush administration, and in only slightly mitigated form under Obama, claims of possible threat from missiles launched by improbable states such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea were among the ‘evidence’ advanced to build and support at extraordinary public expense (and great private profit) a missile- defense program that was initiated under Reagan. The states in question – two of them on the Reagan–Bush ‘axis of evil’ – are surely improbable threats because any launch in the general direction of the US would be met with that missile-launching state's complete nuclear devastation. At the same time, the US turned a blind eye to Indian and Pakistani nuclear weapon development and to Israeli nuclear weaponization in a very volatile part of the world, paying no attention recently to efforts to make the Middle East a nuclear weapons-free region (2010: 63), despite the fact that this would neutralize the nuclear threat posed by Iran. It would also remove nuclear weapon s from Israel, and Israel's role in maintaining US interests (or at least the interests of some in the US) would diminish. The fact that a very large majority of the US po pulation would be in favor of a nuclear -free zone in the area is irrelevant. Public opinion does not count in these ‘matters of state’. Justifications to the US population of policies that take tax funds from individuals (or increase debt that must be paid of f) and direct them not to public n eeds such as education and health care but to support for a privately owned military establishment that aids imperial ambitions remain the same: “self-defense” and “maintaining US interests.” But it is clear whose defense and interests are really at stake. They are not those of the great majority of the US populati on. One could try to argue that the average US citizen has benefited from Grand Area ambitions, but it would be dif ficult. Not only are there examples of economies such as Norway's that have managed to do quite well without neoliberal economic policies accompanied by imperial ambitions, but there are the obvi ous results of neoliberal economic policies: stagnant real income for the majority , massive disparities in wealth, jobs moving of fshore, downsizing, greater efforts to increase ‘productivity’ and ‘ef ficiency’, and so on. The manufacture of consent General points Chomsky's view of mainstream US media is an example o f his more general view of the “intelligentsia” (academics, media), perhaps especially in the US, but certainly in all corporate-run democracies. He thinks that anyone who uses nothing more than Cartesian common sense, a bit of open- mindedness, and a healthy skept icism can see that the intelligentsia serve as purveyors of the ideology of the state (1979). This is not because the various forms of the intelligentsia are engaged in a conspiracy . The explanation is much more straightforward: the intelligentsia go where the rewards of their professions are to be found and, in a corporate-run system, these are gained by not quest ioning the presuppositions of the system. Chomsky and Edward Herman note in After the Cataclysm , the second volume of their Political Economy of Human Rights (1979: 29): “The will to believe patriotic truths and a positive desire to aid the cause o f one's own state are dominant forces, and those abiding by such principle s may also anticipate corresponding rewards and privileges.” In the case of the intelligentsia in the media, the system seems to be particularly ef fective. Chomsky remarked to Mitsou Ronat in 1976, “T o my knowledge, in the American mass media you can not find a single socialist journalist, not a single syndicate d political commentator who is a socialist. From the ideological poin t of view the mass media are almost one hundred percent ‘state capitalist’ ” (Chomsky 197 9: 9). The situation has not changed. Remarkably, this homogeneity is not the result of government oppression or control, as it was in the Soviet Union at the time. It is the result of the fact, Chomsky notes, that “mass media are capitalist institutions” (1979: 29). It is no more surprising than that n o socialist is to be found on the board of directors of General Motors: they do not ‘belong’. And just as members of the boar d of directors of Genera l Motors decide and act in ways that respect the aims of their institution, so do mainstream journalists. Journalists, however , unlike members of boards of directors of corporations, are expected to be dedicated to the pursuit of the truth: their profession would not be taken seriously otherwise. Furthermore, they declare themselves to be professionals dedicated to diggin g for and presenting the truth; they pride themselves on their supposed autonomy and dedication to freedom of the press. This explicitly raises moral obligations that members of boards of directors might deny , although in do ing so, they cease to be fully human, since these are responsibilities any human must respect. Journalists, however , cannot make such a denial : they are committed to telling the truth. Nevertheless, Chomsky shows, they too often lie and misrepresent. They do not consciously intend to do so. Indeed, Chomsky ackno wledges that most journalists are hardworki ng, honest, dedicated individuals who meet high standards of professionalism, exhibit “courage, integrity , and enterpr ise” (1989: 1 1), and fully believe that they are defenders of a free, independent press. It is not their hone sty or their integrity that is at stake but their unexamined “choice of topics and highlighting of issues, the ran ge of opinions permitted expression, the unquestioned premises that guide reporting and commentary , and the general framework imposed for the presentation of a view of the world” (1989: 1 2). The scope of their inquiries and the kind of issues they discuss – on in spection by an open, skeptical eye linked to normal intelligence – are limited in ways that reveal a uniform, dominant ideology . Thus, they fail to fully tell the truth and become purveyors of ideology . In this respect they are serio usly at fault, for they, like other US (and, generally , Western) intellectuals, are in a position to expose the lies of governments, to analyze actions according to their causes and motives and often hidden intentions. [They have] the power that comes from political liberty, from access to information and freedom of expression. For a privileged minority , Western democr acy provides the leisure, the facilities, and the training to seek the truth lying behind the veil of distortion and misrepre sentation, ideology , and class interest. (1987: 60) They acknowled ge that they have the responsibility to tell the truth; they have the means to uncover it; they have the freedom to express it; yet they fail to do so. Chomsky highlights this point by focusing on the question of how free the ‘free press’ really is. It turns out that it is not free, that in the US (and other countries) the press is corporate-owned and reflects the priorities and interests of corpo rations. So, in fact, those who declare that the press is free are deluding themselves. They are engaging in a form of self-deception. Chomsky has written numerous books (sometimes with Edward Herman) demonstrating that while at one level the media provide correct information, they never challenge “the system” – essentially , corporations and their roles in contro lling the economy and government. Indeed, they misrepresent and distort in the interests of power . Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that he has not enjoyed the best of relationships with the mass media, in cluding the “elite” US media – the New York Times , for example, or the New York Review of Books – that, as the most powerful ‘opinion makers’, are in the best position to influence people's views. The New York Times is often the target of Chomsky's ire, perhap s because it claims to print all that is fit to print and purports to be the “newspaper of record.” In one respect it is – it is the “mo st important newspaper and the one that provides the quasi-of ficial record for history” (1989: 225), says Chomsky with hard-to-miss irony . He notes that it was thanked by Arthur Schlesinger for willingly suppressing information in the Bay of Pigs fiasco (1987: 60); that even at the end of the Vietnam conflic t the editors were unable to conceive that the US might have been wron g to invade Vietnam (1979: 36–8); that it (with all other major newspape rs except for some in Chicago where it happene d) virtually ignored the murder of Fred Hampton of the Black Panthers, and, like all the others, ignored clear evidence of FBI complicity , concentrating instead on Watergate, which was in Chomsky's view a far less important crime, involving no harassment or murders by agents of the state. In more recent times, he has mentioned the New York Times 's efforts in the 1980s in Palestinian–Israeli affairs to ignore reports and letters concerning Yasser Arafat's call for negotiations aimed at mutual recognition (1989: 290f) because this went against of ficial US policy . For instance, on December 10, 1986, the New York Times 's Jerusalem correspondent Thomas Friedman insisted that there was no “Arab negotiating partner ,” although six days before this the mass-circulation Israeli Ma’ariv headlin ed “Araf at indicates to Israel that he is ready to enter into direct negotiations” (1989 : 293). (The Israelis under Shimon Peres rejected the of fer.) Another instance: on January 14, 1988, Arafat stated that the PLO would “recognize Israel's right to exist if it and the Unit ed States accept PLO participation in an international Middle East Peace conference” based o n all UN resolutions … Once again the New York Times refused to publish Arafat's statement, or even to permit letters referring to it – though the facts were buried in an article on another topic nine days later . (1989: 295–6) In 1990 Chomsky summarized the situation as: Times history follows the of ficial [US] line [on Israel] throughout. In its news reports and commentary , the major Arab initiatives are down the memory hole, apart from that of Sadat in 1977 – which is admitted into “history” because it could be molded by Washington into an arrangement that satisfied US–Israeli need s. The “peace process” is defined as whatever the US proposes: blocking the peace process for 20 years, in this case. The Times regularly refused to report Arafat's of fers; even letters referring to them were banned. Nor did the New York Times see fit to condemn the atrocities committed by Israeli death squads early in 1995, although it expressed outrage at the mindless murder of Israelis by Hamas. As of May 1995, Chomsky cited reports that put the toll at 124 Israeli dead, 204 Palestinians (1996: 156). The disparity is much greater now , especially after the Intifada in the early 2000s; it is now well into the thousands as opposed to hundreds, especially if one adds to the total of Palestinian dead the number of children and others who have died of starvation and lack of medicine. A media report card pre pared by “If Americans Knew” that covers just the year September 2000 to September 2001 and the whole of 2004 notes the Israeli/Palestinian dead as 165/549 during the relevant dates in 2001–2, and 107/8 18 in 2004. The New York Times 's report of the numbers of deaths during those years was by no means proportional. Israeli deaths were much more heavily reported than Palestinian; in 20 04, 149 percent (sic ) of the much smaller number of Israeli deaths were reported, while only 40 percent of the much greater n umber of Palestinian deaths were. Israeli deaths apparently count much more heavily than Palestinian. The skew is obvious, and the motivations for it easy to discern. New York Times rep orting on Nicaragua and other Central American countries during the late 1970s to early 1990s provides plentiful evidence of mis-emphasis, overlooking, and even fabrication. Objective reports of the apparent vitality of the population of Nicaragua under the Sandinistas, a government rejected by the US because it sought to establish an independent and relatively equitable economy compare unfavorably to the Times 's James Le Moyne's reports of “pot-bellied urchins.” LeMoyne also failed to report that unlike the Sandinistas, the US-supported governments of El Salvador and Honduras engaged in terrorist tactics and killing to keep their population in line. Nor does he report that the US-supported Contras wer e engaged in just these kinds of tactics (Chomsky 1989: 66). He also leaves o ut the role of the US in the matter while emphasizing the roles – supposed and real – of others. LeMoyne's cover story in a 198 6 New York Times Sunday Magazine pro vided a perspective on the guerrilla movements in Central America. Chomsky notes that LeMoyne correctly points out that poverty and failures to bring about political reform played important roles in guerrilla activities, but then devotes considerable space to the roles (supposed and real) of “Cuba, the Soviet Union, North Kore a, the PLO, Vietnam, and so on” (1989: 81). But, Chomsky continues, one participant in the drama is missing, except for the statement that in El Salvador , “the United States bolstered the Salvadoran Army, insisted on elections and called fo r some reforms.” Also missing is the fact that the army that the US supported, and an elite military group trained by the US conducted, a program of slaughter and torture to destroy “the people's or ganizations fighting to defend their most fundamental human rights,” to borrow the words o f Archbishop Romero shortly before his assassination as he vainly pleaded with President Carter n ot to bolster these forces, which repress the people and defend the interest s of the Salvadorean oligarchy (Chomsky 201 1: 28f). The sup port of US Grand Area p olicy is also obvious in the Times reports of what happened after the peace accords in Nicaragua were signed in 1988. While terrorism continued in El Salvador , Honduras, and Guatemala – and indeed, increased – this was barely noted [in the Times ], apart from guerrilla terror in El Salvador , to which the government some times “responded,” James LeMoyne commented with regret. In October 1988, Amnesty International released a rep ort on the sharp increase in death squad killings, abduction , torture, and mutilation, tracing the terro r to the government security fo rces. The Times ign ored the sto ry, while the Senate passed a resolution warn ing Nicaragua that new military aid would be sent to the contras if the Sandinistas continued to violate the peace accords. (1989: 94). I have focused on a very few examples; there are many more. Chomsky documents num erous cases of media bias in favor of the of ficial line from Washington, at least to the extent that it reflects ‘elite’ (corporate economic) opinion. His documentation indicates media support for continued and widening Monroe Doctrine and Grand Area military-economic policy , especially revealing in cases – such as Vietnam, Haiti, Cuba, Chile, El Salvador , and Nicaragua – where the US feared grass-roots efforts to establish an indigenous unaligned government outside US market control. (It is no t import ant for US polic y decisions that there actually be progress; what is important is that it be thought that there might be.) Further documentation o f bias and misrepresentation of various sorts appears below as part of a summary of the “propaganda model” that Chomsky and Herman constructed to predict media reactions to claims by them and others that mainstream US media are biased in favor of US government policies, and that correspondents such as Friedman and LeMoyne are “intellectual commissars” who serve the same function in a democracy that the propaganda machine does in a totalitarian state. Keep in mind that most of the ‘o pinion leaders’ and probably most of the US pub lic firmly believed in the US's good intentions in Nicaragua: LeMoyne, for example, did not consciously lie. It is remarkable how few mainstream and especially elite media journalists actually criticized US intervention in Nicaragua, and even those who did assumed without question that the US's course was idealistically motivated. The New York Times' s Tom Wicker was one of the critical few, and he, Chomsky p oints out, “condemne d the application of the Reagan Doctrine to Nicaragua because ‘the United States has no historic or God-given right to bring democracy to other nations’ ” (1989: 51). But the basic presupposition remains even here – it was assumed that the US's motivation was to institute and support democracy . Criticism was directed only against involvement. The tale continues: it would be very difficult to find outright criticism of US or Israeli exceptionalism (universal moral principles apply to everyone but us, for we cannot be wrong) in any mainstream media public ation in the US. But it is no t at all difficult to find reports of the intransigence of the Palestinians, the terrorism of Hamas, the role of Iran in supporting terrorism, the evil deeds of Muammar Gaddafi, etc. And there are many other examples. So while Chomsky no longer devotes as much of his writing to displaying evidence of media bias, he easily could. And in a way he n eed not do as much as he used to: there are others who have – in most but not all cases, very much belatedly – picked up the theme and continue to provide evidence and constructively point to alternatives. Chomsky sometimes expresses amazement at the extraordinary success of this propaganda machine that always remains silent on the basic ideological presuppositions: no one is coerced concerning what to think or believe, but they do it anyway and are extremely of fended when informed of their bias and their unwillingness to examine it. As an Enlightenment thinker , Chomsky perhaps expects that thought control ought to be much more difficult than control of actio ns. Looking for reward is part of the explanation of the system's effectiveness, of course. In fact, this alone seems to be enough to support the predictions in Chomsky's an d Herman's propaganda model, discussed below . But this explanation does not seem to be quite enough where, as in this case, we find people who claim to be devoted to the pursuit of truth. Another piece of the explanation may be found in what Chomsky has to say about Orwell's problem, discussed in the next chapter . Here, I outline briefly what Chomsky suggests is surely one of the best-attested predictions of the social sciences – or rather, of Cartesian common sense. The propaganda model In introducing the propaganda model, which predicts the phenomenon of US (and generally , Western) media actions and their reactions to criticism, Chomsky point s out that the model fits only mainstream media in democratic but corporate-run states (current forms of Madisonian democracies). In these democrac ies, as John Stuart Mill's father James Mill suggested early in the nineteenth century , those in power will want to use state education and any other means they can (such as the media) to “ ‘train the mind s of the people to a virtuous attachment to their government’ [to authority], and to the arrangements of the social, economic, and political order more generally” (1989: 13). They cannot do so by telling media personnel what to print and say; that is possible in a dictatorship, but not in a democracy . Instead, what they do is provide power and privilege to those who do not question the basic values of the system. Political economist Robert Brady writing about 80 years ago saw the corporation's ‘n eed’ for propaganda: “What in political circles would be called legislative, executive, and judicial powers” is gathered in “controlling han ds” which, “so far as policy formation and execution are concerned, are found at the p eak of the pyramid and are manipulated without significant check from its base.” As private (corporate) power “grows and expands,” it is transformed “into a community forc e ever more politically potent and politically conscious,” ever more dedicated to a “propaganda pro gram” that “becomes a matter of converting the public … to the point of view of the control pyramid” (quoted in 1996: 71–2). Chomsky expands on Brady's propaganda theme: That project, already substantia l in the period Brady reviewed, reached an awesome scale a few years later as American business sought to beat back the social democratic currents of the postwar [World War I] world which reached the United States as well, and to win what its leaders called “ the everlasting battle for the minds of men,” using the huge resources of the public relations industry , the entertainment industry , the corporate media, and whatever else could be mobilized by the “control pyramids” of the social and economic order . (1996: 72) While the actions of mainstream media in corporate-run Madisonian democracies differ from those in dictatorships, both forms are autocratically controlled. In one case the press is responsive to government policy; in the other to the basic policies of the corporate state. Chomsky points out that there is an alternative: a genuinely democratic press. It is represented in 1989's Necessary Illusions (1) in a proposal by Brazil's Catholic bishops that the existing system – in Brazil during the 1980s, TV was owned by five corporations, and almost all advertising was done by eight transnational corporations – be replaced by a system that encourages grass-roots participation. On this Jeffersonian democratic model, the press would be responsive to the truth and to the individual who must make decisions about how he or she and others are to act in society . Arguably, Chomsky's own political ‘journalism’ of fers good examples of what this kind of press might look like – it represents positions fairly and speaks to the ne ed for information by citizens who must make informed decisions concerning how to best meet their needs and hopes. The prop aganda model itself contains three orders of prediction. The first is that “the media serve the inter ests of state and corporate powe r, which are closely interlink ed, framing their reporting and analysis in a manner supportive of established privilege and limiting debate and discussion accordingly” (19 89: 10). The second is that “media debate will be bounded in a manner that satisfies these external needs [of corporate and state power], thus limited to the question of the alleged adversarial stance of the media” (1989: 153). The third is that if there are inquiries into the supposed freedom and lack of bias of the press (such as those presented by Chomsky and Herman), “such inquiry will be ignored or bitterly condem ned, for it conflicts with the needs of the powerful and privileged” (ibid.). “The general prediction, at each level, is that what enters the mainstream will support the needs of established power” (ibid.). This is only what Cartesian common sense accompanied by an open mind and a healthy skepticism would lead one to expect when considering the motivations of people whose service of authority provides them with a privileged place in society . Evidence of first-order predicti ons is provided by simple and obvious paired examples. We have already seen some, such as the way in which the New York Times pres ents the situations and actions of the ‘democracies’ of El Salvador , Guatemala, and Honduras – all US client states in the same region o f the world as Nicaragua, at the same time, at similar levels of development, and facing similar problems – in contrast to the way it presents the situation and actio ns of Nicaragua under the San dinistas. In every instance, Washington's view is presented. Terrorism in the client states is ignored, the benefits p rovided under the Sandinistas ignored, the US's sup port of a proxy army downplayed or ignored. Similar evidence of media bias is seen in the way Palestinian atrocities are pr esented, as opposed to Israeli ones, and in the way Iraq's willingness to comply with US demands is ignored, not to mention the now-historical case of V ietnam. A particularly useful illustration of first-, second-, and third-order predictions of the model is found in noting the ways in which corporate media present “bloodbaths.” In The Pol itical Economy of Human Rights Chomsky and Herman (1979) distinguished constructive, benign, and nefarious bloodbaths. Summarizing this classification in Necessary Illusions , Choms ky says: “ ‘Constructive bloodbaths’ are those that serve the interests of US power; ‘be nign bloodbaths’ are largely irrelevant to these concerns; and ‘nefarious bloodbaths’ are those that can be charged to the acco unt of of ficial enemies and are thus useful for mobilizing the public” (1989: 153–4). The first-order prediction of the model is that constructive bloodbaths will be welcomed, benign ignored, and nefarious “passionately co ndemned” (198 9: 154). As the model predicts , the media reported the Khmer Rouge atrocities in Cambodia as nefarious, the invasion of East Timor by US-backed Indonesia as benign, and the 1990s Gulf War as const ructive. The second-order prediction is that the mainstream media will not study media bias or pre sent information concerning media bias. As predicted, there were no mainstream media studies of how the media present bloodbaths. The third-order prediction is that where studies such as Chomsky and Herman's occur , “exposure will be ignored in the case of constructive bloodbaths; it may be occasionally noted without interest in the case of benign bloodbaths; and it will lead to great indignation in the case of nefarious bloodbaths” (ibid.). As predicted, Chomsky and Herman's criticism of neglect in the case of East Timor was, after several years of persistent effort on their parts and on the parts of others, ackno wledged by the New York Times with a shrug (as seen in Mark Achbar and Peter Wintonick's 1992 CBC film Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media ), while exposur e of patent fabrication of evidence by the media in the case of the Khmer Rouge atrocities raised an immediate hue and cry . The atro cities committed in the US-backed Indonesian invasio n of East Timor p arallel in almost every way those committed by Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge – in “accessibility [to the press], credibility [from reports]’ and character [slaughters of peo ple]” (1989: 155). They were even alike in scale or numbers killed, although – Chomsky remarks – “lar ger in East Timor relative to the population ” (ibid.). The obvious difference was that Cambodia's slaughter was conducted by an of ficial enemy and was, furthermore, highly functional at the time in helping to overcome the “V ietnam syndrome” and to restore p opular support for US intervention and violence in the Third World “in defense against the Pol Pots.” In fact, a few mon ths after [Chomsky and Herman] wrote about this prospect, the deepening engagement of the US governm ent in Pol Pot-style terror in El Salvador was bein g justified as necessary to save the population from the “Pol Pot left.” (ibid.) It is important to keep in mind that Chomsky and Herman do not themselves assess the facts of the case when they present this and other paired example s; they do not go out in the field and do on-the-spot interviews. But they do what anyone could do; they depend on what anyone with common sense would allow are the more reliable sources of information. In the case of East Timor , they rely on refugee and church accounts that were available (little else was), and in the case of Cambodia, on US State Department reports to their own personnel. Sources like these, in the circumstances, are difficult to deny . They provide as good evidence of media bias and fabrication as one could expect. As for the first-o rder predictions in the East Timor/Cambodia pairing, the results are clear. In the case of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge [not when there was US involvement, of course] there were [from US mainstream media] denunciations o f genocide from the first moment, a huge o utcry of protest, fabrication of evidence on a grand scale, suppression o f some of the most reliable sources (including State Department Cambodia watchers, the most knowledgea ble source at the time) because they did not support the preferred picture, reiteration of extraordinary fabrications even after they were openly conceded to have been invented, and so on. In the case of Timor , coverage declined from a substantial level before the US-backed Indonesian invas ion to flat zero as the atrocities reached their peak with increasing US support. (1989: 156) The very considerable details that this summary encapsulates appear in Chomsky and Herman's Manufacturing Consent (1988) and The Political Economy of Human Rights (19 79). Some of the most striking evidence appears in graphic form in the film Manufacturing Consent ; it displays, for example, the number of column inches in the US's “newspape r of record” (the New York Times in 1975–9) devoted to the Pol Pot atrocities (about 1,175 column inches total) as o pposed to the Indonesian invasion of East Timor (70 for the same period). Characteristically, Chomsky later berated himself for not emphasizing in print the mainstream media's suppression of information from East Timor , saying, I publis hed my first word abo ut [East Timor] nineteen months after writing about Khmer Rouge atrocities, though the Timor massacres were far more important by any mor al criterion for the simple and sufficient reason that something could be done to terminate them. Thanks to media self-censorship, there were no substantial efforts to or ganize the kind of opposition that might have com pelled the United States to desist from its active participation in the slaughter . (1989: 156–7) This concern reappears in the discussion of the responsibility of the intellectual below; there, Chom sky remarks of the East Timor atrocities: “T o terminate them has always been very easy, given the locus of responsibility . This is not Bosni a, or Rwanda, or Chechnya. There has been no need to send troops, bom b Jakarta, impose sanctions, even issue warnings. It would have been en ough to turn of f the tap [of US aid]” (1996: 57). The responsibility of the press in this is striking: Chomsky's “article was the first in the US (or , to my knowledge, Canada) devoted specifically to East Timor , only the second that dealt with the topic at all, after three years of huge atrocities, perhaps the worst relative to population since the Holocaust, funded mainly by the American taxpayer” (1996: 58). In the case of East T imor/Cambodia, Chomsky says, the second o rder predictions [of limitation of media debate] were not only confirmed, but far surpassed; the doctrine that was concocted an d quickly became standard, utterly inconsistent with readily documented facts, is that there was “ silence” in the West over the Khmer Rouge atrocities. This fantasy is highly serviceable, not only in suppressing [awareness of] the subordination of educated elites to external power [corporate control], but also in suggesting that in the future we must focus attention still more intensely and narrowly on enemy crime. (1989: 157) The only kind of permissible debate of mainstream media's motivations and actions within these media themselves concerns whether the press might be “too free,” and thus capable of undermining the proper execution of the state/corporate will. As Landrum Bolling put it in 1982, “Can a ‘freepress’, democratic society defend itself and its friends and allies, in a dangerous world, against the totalitarian adversaries that do not have to contend with a free press and uncontrolled television?” (quoted in Chomsky 1989: 1 62). Bolling seems to assume that the press must serve state/corporate interests, and that when it is “too free,” it cannot do so. The third-order prediction in the case of East Timor (benign bloodbath) and Cambodia (nefarious bloodbath) was also confirmed. Herman and Chomsky's criticism that the mainstream press had ignored East Timor was eventually ackno wledged in a dismissive way. It was “conceded that what had hap pened was problematic , even ‘the shaming of Indonesia’ (as the New York T imes described it)” (Chomsky 1996: 58) – but not, of course, the shaming of the press for not p roviding information in a case where US citizens could do something about the atrocity . As for their allegation that the press had exaggerated and created evidence in the form of greatly exaggerated death counts in press reporting of the Khmer Roug e atrocities, it aroused a flood of protest. Chomsky and Herman had used the only reliable evidenc e available at the time – that provided by the US State Department. The press had apparently thought nothing of increasing the few thousand reported deaths to two million, apparently ignoring the obvious sources, and were then of fended when it was pointed out to them what they had done and – much worse – why . It is important to recognize that the propaganda model does not claim that the press will never be critical of what Chomsky calls the “current state managers.” It can be and has been critical: the obvious cases are Watergate and the eventua l recognition that US involvement in Vietnam was wrong. The claim is rather that “the media reflect the consensus of powerful elites of the state–corp orate nexus generally , including those who object to some aspect of government policy , typically on tactical grounds. The model argues, from its foundations, that the media will protect the interests of the powerful, not that it will prot ect state managers from their criticisms” (1989: 1 49). The press follows the consensus of the powerfu l, and in a corporate-based state those who make the basic market decisio ns represent that consensus. Thus, criticism o f involvement in Vietnam never amounted to criticism of the US's ‘right’ to invade a country that seemed to be developing a grass-roots effort to address human needs, or of the Grand Area principles that govern this ‘right’. Elite and media criticism appeared in the form of doubts about the viability of the effort and its cost- effectiveness. In the Watergate case, Chomsky suggests that Nixon had dared to challenge the real masters by including IBM's chairman Tom Watson, the Washington Post , and McGeor ge Bundy on his enemies list and by authorizing a foray against another ‘domestic power ’, the Democratic Party (1988b: 720), thus pitting “men of power against men of power” (1979: 2 1). No doubt, too, Nixon's extraordinary foolishness in maintaining the list, keeping tapes, and authorizing a foray persuaded the power elite that he was expendable and replaceable – particularly given the fact that US administrations, whether Democrat or Republican, have diligently maintained the principles of the Grand Area since the end of W orld W ar II. Notice that the propaganda mo del relies on what Chomsky calls “the interests of the p owerful.” It reflects interests rather than specific decisions, so is not committed to the idea that control of the media is a matter of a few conspirators getting together and deciding how to convince the press to reflect their poi nt of view. It should be obvious that Chomsk y could not accept a conspir acy view in any case. If the media acted as they do as the result of a con spiracy , they could be at least in part excused of their responsibilities because they have been deceived. Chomsky do es not want to excuse these intellectuals, or any others, from their obligation to pursue and tell the truth. Corporate media do as someone with common sense would expect them to: serve the interests of the power elite to preserve their own pri vileged status in society . Such a press is democratic only if one construes a citizen as a consumer , not a free agent. Chomsky remarks: Our political culture has a conce ption of democracy that differs from that of the Brazilian bishops. For them, democracy means that citizens should have the opportunity to inform themselves, to take part in inquiry and discussion and policy formation, and to advance their program s through political actions . For us, demo cracy is more narrowly conceived: the citizen is a consumer , an observer but not a participant. (1989: 14) If that is so, mainstream corpora te media, and particularly the elite media, are “vigilant guardians protec ting privilege from the threat of public understanding and participation” (ibid.) by providing only filtered information and by encouraging public apathy . Chomsky allows that criticisms could be raised against his alternative genuinely democratic model of the media – media that “tell the truth” so that free agents can decide. For example, “the call for democratizing the media could mask highly unwelcome ef forts to limit intellectual independence through popular pressures” (ibid.) – everything from certain forms of “political correctness” to censorship by self-appointed defenders of morality and “family values” (the “moral majority”). But while this problem is “not easily dismissed, … it is not an inhe rent property of democratization of the media” (ibid.). By allowing a voice to various points of view, a democratized press might well provide a form of self-correction. Chomsky also assumes that people share a human nature and certain basic needs, so that, once the extern al influence of efforts to advance “economic man” are corrected by serious efforts to tell the truth, people will probably conver ge in their judgments. He holds out hope for such change in the belief that “any system that's based on lying and deceit is inherently unstable” (1987: 49). I add a comment. Even though n ow that the internet of fers those with the necessary equip ment a means to get access to a wide range of information, much of it free of charge (including www.chomsky .info ), and even with the reduction in influence of at least some traditional media, including newspapers such as the New York Times , I have not yet seen an improvement in political discussion and discourse. If anything, matters are worse. Part of the reason is no doubt due to the influence of television and Fox News in particular with its brand of (mis)infotainment – infotainment that should be amusing (and is, as it is portrayed on The Daily Show ), except that so many take it seriously . Another part of the reason for this, no doubt, is that well-funded neoliberal ‘think tanks’ and bloggers maintain a strong presence on the net, and while progressive sites such as Znet and bloggers are also present, funding is far more limited, and often depends on subscriber donations. But perha ps the most significant reason is just that people lack the interest (and often the time) to treat the material they get critically, to think it through, and to detect the interests that skew the information that they get. This is no surprise. A large majority of the population must work (often at more than one job), and they have little time left for reflection, not to mention paying attention to the views of others. The responsibility of intellectuals The propaganda model's assessment of certain intellectuals – press reporters, corres pondents, and editors – is a special case of Chomsky's more general assessment of intellectuals in the corporate ‘guided’ free speech communities provided by cap italist economies. It is an application of nineteenth-century Russian anarchist writer Bakunin's prediction regarding any form of society in which authority resides in a few. Bakunin's target was the Leninist-inclined Marxist: According to the theory of Mr. Marx, the people not only must not destroy [the state] but must strengthen it and place it at the complete disposal of their benefactors, guardians, and teachers – the leaders of the Communist part y, namely Mr. Marx and his friends, who will proceed to liberate [mankind] in their own way. They will establish a single state bank, concentrating in its hands all commercial, industrial, agricultural and even scientific production , and then divide the masses into two armies – industrial and agricultural – under the direct comma nd of the state engineers who will constitute a new privileged scientific-political estate. (Quoted in Chomsky 1987: 84) The “new privileged scientific-political estate” would consist of managers who have access to information and distribute it as the system needs, to their benefit. The intellectuals would be among them, constituting a new class that uses its access to inf ormation to gain control of economy and society . They will form, Bakuni n said, “the reign of scientific intelligence, the most aristocratic, despotic, arrogant, and elitist of all regimes. There will be scholars, and the world will be divided into a minority ruling in the name of knowledge, and an immense ignorant majority . And then, woe unto the mass of ignorant ones” (quo ted in 1981b: 24). Chomsky in cludes most social scientists among manag ers and points out (to repeat a previous citation) that much of the “alleged complexity , depth, and obsc urity of the analysis of contemporary affairs is part of the illusion propag ated by the system o f ideolo gical control, which aims to make the issues seem remote from the general population an d to persuade them of their incapacity to or ganize their own affairs” (197 9: 4–5) – to persuade them that they should cede co ntrol to those who claim to know . Such mystification is characteristic of the irresponsible intellectual, for it involves the abuse and misuse of truth. Chomsky has emphasized the theme of the responsibility of the intellectual from the very beginning of his political work. At one level, his view is simple and has not changed. In a speech to the Writers' Centre in Sydney , Australia, in January 1995, he says, “the intellectual responsibility of the writer, or any decent person, is to tell the truth” (1996: 5 5; cf. 1976: 325). More specifically , he adds, “it is a moral imperative to find out and tell the truth as b est one can , about things that matter , to the right audience ” (1996: 55). This “is often hard, and can be personally cos tly, particularly for those who are more vulnerable. That is true even in societies that are very free; in others, the costs can be severe indeed” (1996: 55–6). His remark, “as best one can,” should be read “as best one can , given that one is operating within the com monsense framework.” The truths that are relevant here are practical truths, those that involve humans and their social and political affairs. The truths of the various serious sciences are not dir ectly apropos. The qualification signaled by the italics allows for the still very remote possibility , explored in the next chapter , that Chomsky's science of language might bear in some way on his political views, through the mediation of its implications for human nature. What about “thi ngs that matter” and “right audience”? Chomsky points out that there are certain ways to explain what matters that are irrelevant to discussion of political and soci al questions. To illustrate, he mentions the question of whether the brain sciences have anything to say about various mental phenomena. This question matters to numerous people, and the puzzle about what the brain sciences might have to say about consciousness, for example, has a certain intellectual interest to virtually everyone. But questions of this sort have little, if anything, to do with practical human affairs. Chomsky conceives of the human being as involved in practical affairs as an agent . So when the writer or other intellectual acts as moral agent , he or she is supposed to brin g “the truth about matters of human significance to an a udience that can do someth ing about them” (1996: 56). This is “part of what it means to be a moral agen t rather than a monster .” Unfortunately , “the standard practice of the intellectual com munities to which we (more or less) belong rejects this elementary mor al principle, with considerable fervor and passion, in fact. We may even have sunk to historical lower depths, in this regard, by the natural measure [of] comparison of standard practice to opportunities available” (ibid.). “W e” have access to extraordinary amounts of information and live in societies that allow freedom of expressio n but, more often than not, “we” become willing members of Bakunin's new class, as Chomsky shows with his data comparing press activities with regard to Indonesian atro cities in East Timor and Khmer Rouge atrocities in Cambodia. The responsibili ty of Western in tellectuals [in this case] has been to tell the truth about the “shaming of the West” [East Timor] to a Western audience, who can act to terminate the crimes effectively, easily, and quickly . Simple, unambiguous, and plainly correct. If [these intellectuals] chose to condemn K[hmerlR[ou ge] atrocities, well and good, as long as they tried to keep to the truth. But it was a matter of limited importance, unless they had some proposal about what to do; no one did. One should also tell the truth about Genghis Khan, but the task hardly rates high on the moral scale. (1996: 60) We have no mo ral responsibilit y for Genghis Khan's actions, but we do for those where we can affect the outcome. Naturally, the audience plays an important role here, and Choms ky illustrates his view of how one chooses an audience to whom one tells the truth by comparing his own efforts to those of Quaker friends with whom he has participated in various protests. Quakers adhere to the principle that one must speak the truth to those in power . Chomsky disagrees, calling this a form of self-indulgence. “It is a waste of time and a pointless pursuit to speak truth to Henry Kissinger , or the CEO of General Motors, o r others who exercise power in coercive institutions – truths that they already know well enough, for the most part” (1996: 61). If one could find such a person in a situation in which he or she is not playing an institutional ro le but acting as a human being with normal human concerns and sympathies, then this technique might be effective. But “as peop le who wield power , they are hardly worth addressing, any more than the worst tyrants and criminals, who are also human beings [and should be held responsible for their actions], however terrible their actions” (ibid.). Moreover , Chomsky ins ists, while one should seek out an audience that matters, “it should not be seen as an audience, but as a co mmunity of common concern in which one hopes to participate constructively . We should not be speaking to , but with. That is second nature to any good teacher, and should be to any writer and intellectual as well” (ibid.). This recalls Chomsky's view that libertarianism (or anarchy) cannot properly be conceived apart from socialism (syndicalism). Nor can it be claimed that the intellectual does not recognize the elementary principle that one should speak of things that matter mo rally. “W estern intellectuals … understand the point very well, and have no trouble applying elementary moral principles in at least one case, [to] of ficial enemies, say, Stalin ist Russia” (ibid.). Specifically , Western intellectuals applied elementary moral principles to their counterparts in Stalinist Russia in the following ways (quoting from 1996: 62–3): 1. If Soviet intellectuals told the truth about American crimes, well and good, but they won no praise from us … 2. If a So viet inte llectual exaggerated or fabricated American crimes, then he became an object of contempt. 3. If a Soviet inte llectual ignored American crimes, it was a matter of no consequence … 4. If Sovi et intell ectuals denied or minimized American crimes, … it was also a matter of minor or even null significance. 5. If Sovi et intell ectuals ignored or justified Soviet crimes, that was criminal. Applying the same reasonable moral standards to Western intellectuals, we should find: 1. If Western intellectuals told the truth about the crimes of the USSR, Pol Pot, [and) Saddam Hussein (after he was designated an enemy in August 1990), that's fine, but has no moral standing. 2. If they exaggerate or fabricate such crimes, they become obje cts of contempt. 3. If they ignore such crimes, it is a matter of little significance. 4. If they deny or minimize such crimes, it is also a minor matter . 5. And if they ignore or justify the crimes in which their own state is implicated, that is criminal. But Western intellectuals judge their own actions in the opposite way: those who uncovered the crimes of Baghdad, Iran, and Pol Pot were praised, and there was no recognition of the fact that ignoring o r justifying the crimes of on e's own state is criminal. Chomsky grants that points 3 and 4, while parallel to the Soviet case, are, strictly, inapplicable to the Western intellectual: he or she should not ignore or minim ize the crimes o f Saddam, Stalin, or Pol Pot. But point 5 applies, unequivocally . Chomsky allows that one could ar gue that it is unfair to compare Soviet and W estern intellectuals. But the unfairne ss is to the Soviet commissars, “who could at least plead fear, no t mere servility and cowardice” (1996: 65). The culpability of Western intellectuals is greater, because of their much greater freedom and opportunity . Moreover , at least the Soviet commissars, “however corrupt, generally wer e able to recogni ze that the inva sion of Afghanistan was just that: an invasion of Afghanista n.” But in the case of Vietnam, Chomsky notes, he had at the time been lo oking for 30 years, but had not found “one accurate referen ce in the mainst ream to John F. Kennedy's escalation of US intervention in Indochina from support for a standard Latin America-style terror state to outright aggression against South Vietnam, which bore the brunt of US aggression in Indochina throughout” (ibid.). In matters directly related to issues of human concern, Western intellectuals adopt a double standard and subordinate their responsibility to the truth to satisfying the demands of the state/corporation. Cho msky and a few others are exceptions, of course: in matters of human concern, he tries to tell the truth about things that matter to anyone who is, or can be prompted to become, a moral agent who might try to do some thing about them. The anarchosyndicalist conception of persons and their social organization We have seen evidence of problems inherent in the neoliberal conception of the human being and the kind of social or ganization that this conception engenders, and we have also looked at an explanation of why intellectuals do not criticize the basic principles and assumptions of a state conceived in this way. Now we can look at Chomsky's “vision” (1996) of an ideal form of socia l or ganization. His vision is based on what he hopes is a correct account of human nature. But as emphasized in the next chapter , whether his account is correct is an empirical matter, and he is well aware of the limited evidence in its favor . Anarchosyndicalism might seem to some to be a contradiction in terms. Isn't anarchism the complete absence of any obligations towards others? It might appear so to those who have in mind as a model of the person something like economic man. This view of anarchism and its values is represented in economist James Bu chanan's account of the ideal society . Buchanan holds that “the ideal society is anarchy” in which no one man or group of men coerces another . He glosses this in the following way: “any person's ideal situation is one that allows him full freedom of action and inhibits the behavior of others so as to force adherence to his own desires. That is to say, each person seeks mastery over a world of slaves” (Buchanan 1975: 7. 6.5). The definition of anarchy as the absence of coercio n by others is on the right track, but Buchanan's gloss appears pathologic al. Yet it is what the conception of economic man in terms of accumulation and domination seems to lead to. Unlike Buchanan, Chomsky is an anarchosyndicalist, and the “syndicalist” side of anarchosyndicalism reminds us that Chomsky's conception of anarchism and anarchy is by no means like Buchanan's gloss. In fact, Chomsky says, “In today's world, … the goals of a committed anarchist should be to defend so me state institutions from the attack against them, while trying at the same time to pry them open to more meaningful public p articipation – and ultimately, to dismantle them in a much more free society , if the appropriate circumstances can be achieved” (1996: 75; emphasis added). The institutions he has in mind are those that limit the powers of corporations to pollut e, to eliminate or severely restrict unions, to restrict trade, to avoid taxation, and the like. Since there is – as we have seen – plenty of evidence that in capitalist and still dominantly Madisonian democracies like those found in industrialized countries at the moment, this aim both is necessary and leads to stable economies with greater growth, this is for the anarchosyndicalist a reasonable interim solut ion. Better, though, would be a system that replaced the capitalist one, if something closer to an anarchosyndicalist ideal can be achieved. “Anarchosyndicalism” is interchangeable with “libertarian socialism.” In an interview on London W eekend TV in 1976 Chomsky said: [A]narchism can be conceived as a kind of voluntary socialism, that is, as libertarian socialist or anarcho-syndicalist or communist anarchist in the tradition of say Bakunin and Kropotkin and others. They had in mind a highly o rganized form of society , but a society that was or ganized on the basis of or ganic units, or ganic com munities. And generally they meant by that the workplace and the neighborhood, and for these two basic units there co uld derive through federal arrangements a highly integrated kind of socia l or ganization, which might be national or even international in scope. And these decisions could be made over a substantial range, but by delegates who are always pa rt of the or ganic community fro m which they come, to which they return and in which, in fact, they live. (1981b: 245) The result for anarchosyndicalism/libertarian socialism is a form of representational government, but very much unlike what one finds in the US or the UK at the moment. In these latter forms, repre sentation is “limited to the political sphere and in no serious way encroaches on the economic sphere.” Chomsky continues: “Anarchists of this tradition have always held that democratic con trol of one's productive life is at the core of any serious human liberation, or , for that matter, of any significant democratic prac tice” (1981b: 246). This is the context for Chomsky's insistence that people need free and productive activity in order to fulfill themselves. If they do not have it and must ‘rent’ their labor to others who treat them solely in terms of their part in production without giving them effective contro l, the result is “coercion and oppression.” Coercion and oppression take their standard meanings (doing things against one's will and unjust exercise o f power), but because he takes free and creative activity to be a fundamental need of humans, Chomsky presumably also intends some of the psychological aspects of o ppression – depression, failure to thrive. In fact, as is clear from earlier discussion, this aspect is quite important to him: the result of taking accumulation and domination as the basic values, particularly in the form these values now take in the operations of corporations, affects both victim and those in charge of the corporations. It is, as quoted above, a “psychological and moral absurdity which leads to untold suffering for those who try to mold themselves to this pattern, as well as for their victims” (1981b: 226). This connecti on to the psychological is tied to the fact that Chomsky holds that anarchosyndicalism is at least in principle defensible as an empirical claim about the nature of a society in which human beings cannot just survive but thrive, by fulfilling their natures. It is important to see that for Chomsky anarchosyndicalism/libertarian socialism is both an outgrowth of the Enlightenment and a response to a specific problem that was not anticipated when Enlightenment thinkers began to deliberate about implementing the humanistic ideal of the autonomous and responsible p erson who employs the problem-solving powers with which he or she has been endowed (reason) to create a form of social or ganizati on that provides for the needs of such a person. There is no question but that Thomas Jefferson, Henry David Thoreau, Alexander von Humboldt, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau (in some works, at least) had in mind a society of uncoerced individuals that met the bare description of anarchy that Buchanan of fered, a society in which “no one man or group of men co erces another .” But these thinkers did not have in mind the pathological glo ss that Buchanan put on it; nor , crucially, did they have in mind anything like the concept of private power in corporations that has emerged. For them, the power to coerce was held by church or state (often in concert), and – as Jefferson pu t it – government is best that governs least. Today , concentration of private power in corporations represents for Chomsky , as we have seen, the most serious challenge to the basically anarchist principles of Jefferson and others. He sees anarchosyndicalism as a modification of the basic Enlightenment conception of the person as a free and resp onsible agent, a modification required to meet the challenge of private power . Empowering ind ividuals by putting control back into their hands is the best way to meet this challenge and provide a mean ingful form of freedom. Chomsky is no Luddite. The technological advances of industrial society could well be turned to aid the advance of the anarchosyndicali st ideal. He remarks: I think that industrialization and the advance of technolo gy raise possibilities for self-manageme nt over a broad scale that simply didn't exist in an earlier period. And that in fact this is precisely the rational mode for an advanced and complex industrial society , one in which workers can very well become masters of their own immediate affairs, that is, in direction and control of the shop, but also can be in a position to make the major substantive decisions concerning the structure of the economy , conce rning social institutions, concerning planning regionally and beyond. At present, institutions do not permit them to have control over the requisite information, and the relevant training to understand these matters. A good deal could be automated. Much of the necessary work that is required to keep a decent level of social life goin g can be consigned to machines – at least in principle – which means humans can be free to under take the kind of creative work which may not have been possible, objectively , in the early stages of the industrial revolution. (1981b: 248–9) This projection of ways in which technology might be appropriated by the anarchist thinke r is at best a gesture in a direction, but that is excusable, even preferable. It is best to maintain reasonable principles of human nature at the core of one's “vision” while allowing for differences in implementation and, at a particular time, differences in specific “goals” (again his terminology) or plans of action. If nothing else, dif ferent societies with different problems and at different stages of industrialization, health care pro vision, and so on will require different specific propo sals. These remarks reflect Chomsky's prac tical core. He is no pie-in-the-sky idealist. He wants to move towards what can be accomplished at a partic ular time in a pa rticular society , given a good understanding not just of what one eventually hope s for (the visio n) but of how people think and act at a particular time. Chomsky has made specific suggestions for implementing worker control of the “means of production”: Beginning with the two modes of immediate or ganization and control, namely or ganiza tion and control in the workplace and in the community , one can imagine a network of workers' councils, and at a higher level, representation across the factories, or across branches of industry , or across crafts, and on to general assemblies of workers' councils that can be regio nal and national and int ernational in character. And from another point of view one can project a system of governance that involves local assemblies – again federated regionally , dealing with regional issues, crossing crafts, industries, trades and so on and again at the level of the nation or beyond, through federation and so on. (1981b: 249) He explicitly refuses to provide more details about how these forms could develop and how they would interrelate. Presumably, though , given his antipathy toward s the Leninist strategy of implementing a system from ‘on high’, he would reject any proposal along these lines. Indee d, no self- respecting anarchist could propose anything like Leninist or other forms of top-down implementation, for that would undermine the anarchist's own declared principles. This points to the use of anarchosyndicalism/libertarian socialism as a critical tool. If Chomsky's view of human nature and his diagnosis of social and personal ills are correct, an anarchosyndicalist form of or ganization should have benefits, for it rules out autocratic forms of control that demonstrably – in Chomsky's view – lead to depression on the part of those who are used and to becoming “moral monst ers” on the part of the users. But it would require ef fort: it would require that individuals no longer abandon control of their economies and societies to the ‘experts’, but accept individual responsibility for their direction – something Chomsky thinks is not only desirable, but possible. The feeling of helplessness before the complexity of modern society is, as we will see, in part fostered by those forces most interested in maintaining their control. In a connected vein, the prin ciples of anarchosyndicalism rule out political parties: I think it is fair to say that insofar as political parties are felt to be necessary , anarchist or ganization of society will have failed. That is, it should be the case, I would thin k, that where there is direct participation in self-management, in economic and social affairs, then factions, conflicts, differences of interests and ideas and opinion, which should be welcomed and cultivated, will be expressed at every one of these levels. Why they should fall into two, three, or n political parties, I don't quite see. I think that the complexity of human interest and life does not fall in that fashion. Parties represent basically class interests, and classes would have been eliminated or transcended in such a society . (1981b: 250) On the other hand, elsewhere he seems to be happy enough to speak of class interests and of classes or ganizing to defend those interests (cf. 1981b: 59). So, while he thinks that parties are ruled out as a vision, they are allowed as a sensible interim goal. A similar attitude is found in more recent emphasis of the point that the aim in democratic societie s should not be to overthrow government, but to take control of government from corporations and make them responsible to people (e.g., 1998b: 138f). The more interesting aspect of this quotation, however , is Chomsky's emphasis on differences of interests, ideas, and opinions. This reflects an important feature of his view of Cartesian commonsense understanding – its non-systematic and highly flexible character. This is the framework that people use in dealing with politi cal matters, and anarchosyndicalism has the merit of recognizing not just diversity in individuals (specific interests and talents at various stages of development) but diversity in specific, local forms of or ganization (communities, industries). Chomsky seems to think that there is a connection between individual and communal diversity and his view that governance should not be a specialization in which only som e people participate: specializat ion leads to too great a concentration of inter ests and a skewed view of what needs to be done. On the other hand, he allows that governance may be a specialized skill that requires specialized training, training that may require too much time and ef fort to provide to everyone. It may be that governance is itself a function on a par with, say, steel production. If that turns out to be true – and I think that is a question of empirical fact that has to be determined, it can't be projected out of the mind – but if it turns out to be true then it seems to me that the natural suggestion is that governance should be or ganized industrially , as simply one of the branches of industry , with their own workers' cou ncils and their own self-governance and their own participation in broader assemblies. (1981b: 251) Chomsky's Lon don TV interviewer , Peter Jay, pressed him on several issues concerning the viability of anarchism. His answers to questions concerning how the anarchist deals with the problem of work that needs to be done but that people might find uninteresting or unappealing – cleaning sewers, for example, or maintai ning electrical circuits in an ice storm – are particularly helpful in understanding the connection he sees between work, fulfillment, and control. A lot of this work could and should be automated, Chomsky assumes, and he suggests that if more serious attentio n were paid to dealing scientifically with ways to perform the undesi rable tasks (something not done now because people have always assumed that there would be “wage slaves” who needed to do the undesirable work in order to live), it is possible that there would be very few onerous tasks that required human workers. Moreover , some such tasks might, with sufficient technological support, prove sufficiently challenging and interesting – or could be made so – that peopl e might want to do them. Nevertheless, if there still remain some undesirable tasks that need to be done, Chomsky suggests that one solution is to share them (1981b: 254–5) on a part-time basis. Another solution is to pro vide additional remuneration to those who do the unpleasant jobs (1981b: 256). Chomsky prefers the first solution, in which people receive approximately equal pay and the residue of unpleasant tasks that must be performed is shared, but grants that the second solution is consistent with anarchism. Both solutions would be very different from today's arrangements, where the people who do the unpleasant work are those who are lowest paid. Pressed about whether such solutions are feasible while still maintaining the standard of living that people are used to, Chomsky's reply reveals an important assumption – that people find work that produces things that are useful to others fulfilling and meaningful. He says: Now , you speak of work freely undertaken as a hobby . But I don't believe that. I think work freely undertaken can be useful, meaningful work done well. Also you pose a dilemma which many people pose, between desire for satisfaction in work and a desire to create things of value to the community . But it's not so obvious that there is any dilemma, any contradiction. So it's by no means clear – in fact I think it's false – that contributing to the enhancemen t of pleasure and satisfaction in work is inversely propor tional to contributing to the value of the outp ut. [Most of] the occupations that exist – specially the ones that involve what are called services, that is, relation s to human beings – have an intrinsic satisfaction and rewards associated with them, namely in the dealings with the human beings that are involved. That's true of teaching, and it's true of ice cream vending. (1981b: 257–8) Chomsky seems to think that the connection between self-satisfaction and fulfillment in one's work an d producing something useful for the community is empirically based. He mentions interviews with assembly line workers which indicate that their greatest complaint is that they cannot do their job well at the pace they are forced to do it; he also mentions that the most successful predictor for a long life, other factors being equal, is job satisfaction. And he claims that an important part of the satisfaction has to do with “knowledge that you are doing something useful for the community . … I think the feeling that what one is doing is important, is worth do ing, con tributes to those with whom one has social bonds, is a very significant facto r in one's personal satisfaction” (1981b: 258). That is not all, o f course; there is the satisfaction of pride and self-fulfillment in a job well don e. But it is obvious that he holds that free, creative activity and contributions to the community are by no means unrelated; that the satisfaction obtained from the use of one's talents, skills, and intelligence in producing things (solving probl ems using a native capacity) that are useful to o thers is par t of the fulfillment one gets from free, creative activity. People find that control over their own labor is a matter of freedom and self-fulfillment, and, far from being a matter of mastery over others, Chomsky holds, this self-fulfillment is closely tied to contributing to others by p roducing things that are useful to them. Buchanan's gloss of anarchy in terms of mastery over a world of slaves really does appear to be pathological. Chomsky grants that a successful society run along lines that are consistent with anarchosyndic alism would have to be one in which everyone is educated and capa ble of dealing with the busine ss/industrial issues o n which he or she will be asked to make decisions (so be able to understand basic mathematics and statistics, say, and be sufficiently informed about what others are doing). Moreover , he holds, one must suppose that the success of such a society would require a “transformation in the way humans conceive of themselves and their ability to act, to decide, to create, to prod uce, to enquire.” This is not, presumably , a transformation in human nature itself, which he holds has changed little since the introduction of language, but a matter of reorienting the values that one puts on what one produces and on relationships to others – their importance, significance, and the like. Furthermore, Chomsky says, the point is to introduce institutions that will assist this transformation and maintain it – that will “permit new aspects of human nature to flourish” (1981b: 260), recalling the theme that human nature and particular talents provide for unexplored aven ues. Perhaps we will be guided to anarchosyndicalism by our natures (unless we destroy ourselves first). Chomsky concludes: [I]t seems to me that the development towards state totalitarianism and towards economic concentration – and of course they are linked – will continually lead to revulsion, to efforts of personal liberation and to or ganizational efforts at social liberation. And that'll take all sorts of forms. Throughout all Europe, in one form or another , there is a call for what is sometimes called worker participation or co-determination, or even som etimes worker control. Now most of these efforts are minimal. I think that they're misleading, in fact may even undermine efforts for the working class to liberate itself. But in part they're responsive to a strong intuition and understanding that coercion and oppression, whether by private [capitalist] economic power or by the State bureaucracy, is by no means a necessary feature of human life. And the more those concentrations o f power and authority continue, the more we will see revulsion against them and efforts to or ganize and overthrow them. Sooner or later they'll succeed, I hope. (1981b: 260–1) While he has provided ample evidence at global, national, and individual levels o f the degradations of ne oliberal policies, the growth in power and influence of transnational corporations and the globalization of the economy under neoliberal rule may well make this more difficult than Chomsky had hoped at the time of the interview , although it might be argued that this further concentration of private power could hasten the process. Chomsky , however , would probably decline to speculate about this: “I don't think I'm wise enough, or informed enough , to make predictions and I think predictions about such poorly-understood matters probably generally reflect personality more than judgment” (1981b: 260). No tes 1 What about the T ea Party? Most T ea Party sympathizers have genuine grievances, as do many middle- and lower -class US citizens. However , the diagnosis of the causes of their grievances – of fered to them by Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, Fox News, and the like – is far from accurate, and effectively turns genuine grievance into unwitting support of neoliberal ideology . Chomsky has remarked in interviews that he would be happy to speak to T ea Party sympathizers, but he has not been invited. 2 These present a plausible summary of the desiderata of a good life, and a summary also of what a good form of political or ganization or polity should provide. 8 Lan guage an d Po litics: Justificatio n In chapter 7 I sketched Cho msky's anarchosyndicalist/libertarian socialist picture o f socioeconomic or political or ganization – one in which he thinks humans would not just survive, but thrive. Assume – reasonab ly – that an ideal form of social or ganization for humans must be based on and justified by appeal to a view of human nature that is itself justified. That view of human nature can be justified not by dogma, but by evidence and – ultimately – a good natural science of human nature. 1 I investigate Chomsky's suggestions concerning human nature and his efforts at providing justification below . Implicit in proceeding this way is a further assumption: humans have a fixed and distinctive nature. There is good reason to assume that: language – probably among other factors, such as a moral sense – is universal, built into biology , distinctive to humans, and has been in place fo r millennia. And if some aspect of our natures is unique to us, it is plausibl e that it would engender needs specific to our species. Still another assumption is that an ideal projected from a science of a distinct nature applies to all humans, if it applies to any . Culture and circumstance can affect the degree to which attaining an ideal is possible, but do not affect human nature, or the ideal.2 And finally , as suggested before, we must assume that a socioeconomic ideal for humans can be based on satisfying needs distinctive to humans. While bonobos and we need to survive and associate with consp ecifics, likely only we need to be able to be creative and to associate under conditions of freedom and mutual respect. All humans rely on a socioecon omic ideal. Critical analysis depends on a way to detect political, social, and economic problems, to measure progress, and to propose changes. Engaging in critical analysis and proposing alternatives are not reserved for ‘experts’. Virtually everyone does engage in these tasks when thinking about and discussing political and economic issues. In carrying them out, peo ple appeal to an ideal, a ‘vision’ that serves as at least a measure of progress. Plausibly, to do that well, they should appeal to a vision that can itself be justified. There should be no doubt that there is a human nature. As Chomsky points out in a discussion with Scott Burchill in 1998], to claim there is no human nature is to claim that the result of human reproduction could as easily be a chicken or an elephant. And if some aspect of our natures is unique to us, it is plausible that it would engender needs specific to our species. No science of all that is distinctive about human nature exists. Apart from some important insights such as the fact that humans alone have language (and what language co nsists of), natural science does n ot currently of fer the tools to describe exactly what is distinctive about human nature. That is a shame, because a n atural science of human nature would be objective, unlike anything available through the concepts of com mon sense. But we must justify anyway . So in addition to what we can learn from science, we must appeal to what we can reasonably gather from history , literature, and the like about distinctively human capacities and needs. We can appeal to fair polls of ‘what people want’ (which are rarely reported in mainstream media), and to instincts of fairness and justice of the sort that are well-attested in John Mikhail's science of a moral sense. In effect, we appeal to commonsense understanding, critically applied, where this includes treating one's own case as one treats others'. Chomsky appeals to all these resources when he suggests a list of distinctive human needs. Applying comm onsense unde rstanding and noting consequ ences of neoliberal ideals, we have seen that it is difficult (unless, apparently , you are an economist like Buchanan) to believe that anyone would take maximization of accumulation and domination as human needs, much less distinctively human ones. It is still more difficult to take seriously that an ideal soc iety wo uld be one in which these are maximally imple mented. As Thomas Hobbes recognized, that kind of state (he called it a state of nature) will not permit even local forms of law and justice such as those that arise in fo rms of soci al or ganization. As remedy for a creature with needs rather like accumulation and dominatio n (creatures who could plausibly expect an existence that is “solitary , poor , nasty , brutish, and short”), he proposed a polity in which individuals surrender their individual wills to that of a ‘sovereign’. It is not clear what surrendering one's will is, nor what a ‘sovereign’ amo unts to; there are various interpretations. On no plausible reading, howeve r, does Hobbes's remedy yield anything like an ideal state that serves the fundamental needs of all its citizens. Perhaps that is because Hobbes, Buchanan, and the neoliberal begin with an implausible view of the distinctive characteristics and needs of human nature, of equality ,3 and of ways to or ganize. Hobbes might be correct, of course; it is an empirical matter.4 But it would be surprising: our understanding of what is distinctive about humans, albeit incomplete, has made at least some progre ss since his time. Although – as emphasized – it is limited, we cannot dismiss what natural science has told us about human nature. Given what Chomsky and colleagues have shown, langu age (perhaps a form of recursion alone, although likely human concepts too) is unique to human beings . Given also other considerations discussed before, we can tentatively claim that language's combinatory core came to be introduced to the human species as the result of a single mutation . If language so conceived is unique to humans, a science of language can make a crucial contribution to the science of human nature, that is, to characterizing what is distinctively human about our biology , course of development/growth, and mature state. There is no strong argument yet in favor of anything besides language being distinctively human unle ss it is a moral faculty (which Mikhail's account indicates depends on language) and some kind of instinct for cooperative or ganization. If so, one could tentatively adopt a strong thesis that has not yet been shown to be obviously wrong. That thesis is that language suffices to make humans distinctive – that all other apparently uniquely human characteristics such as creating non-kin, non-contact forms of so cial or ganization such as republics and cities are capacities that rest on language, plus perhaps its use in communication. Possibly anthropologists and ethnologists are right and – as Jared Diamond puts it – there was a “great leap forward.” A group o f humanoids somewhere in Africa began to show the first manifestations of what we call culture: art, religion and related forms of ultimate explanation, technology , adaptability to different environments, agriculture, new forms of social or ganization, and the like. Assume too that accompanying this and likely a product of it, the migration from Africa began, leading to widely scattered humans that are basically indistinguishable in their cognit ive capacities, even though they have been separated for millennia and have employed their cognitive capacities to produce differen t solutions to deal with their environments and each other – different cultures. Assuming a great leap and no important changes since, the stron g thesis is prima facie plausible: the evolution of language (and perhaps a moral sense) led to all the other manifestations of ‘the human difference’. That thesis is p lausible, in part, because language of fers humans the benefit of what Chomsky calls “ordinary creativity” (in effect, the creative aspect of language use), a benef it that plausibly underlies the flexibility and adaptability to different environments characteristic of the human species alone, an d crucial not only to individual self-expression but to the creation of cultures. The ‘gift’ of a form of recursion provides endles s cognitive perspectives, indeterminately many on an occasion usable ones. It provides our cogn itive systems a way of or ganizing and reor ganizing to deal with all sorts of practical problems. And to the extent that language can also of fer humans at least the natural number systems and the capacity to engage in abstract thought, to speculate, and to seek answers to questio ns such as where we came from, it underwrites at least primitive science. Even if the strong thesis were incorrect, there would be a significant relationship – proceeding through human nature – between Chomsky's science of human nature and his political views. Chomsky expresses diffidence, even skepticism, when asked to speak about the relationship between his political views and his linguistics. 5 No dou bt part of the reason for this is that too many who ask – such as media personnel – want a quick and ready answer (a ‘sound bite’), as well as one that suits their presuppositions about how such a question should be answered. (You remark that Fren ch intellectuals have a totalitarian streak, Prof . Chomsky . Could this be because they speak French?) Because, however , any connection is tenuous and indirect, at best, the diffidence is real, not feigned. Nevertheless, his version of anarchism assumes the possibility of a stable, free association of individuals that meets human needs and avo ids recourse to the pathological “state of na ture” as understood by Hobbes, Buchanan, and some current evolutionary p sychologists – especially in the form of an absence of social ties and obliga tions, with war of each against each as the means to resolve conflict. Chomsky holds that people will naturally conver ge on a kind of order that respects what Bakunin called an “instinct for freedom,” a natural desire/need to overcome the “constraints of external authority” (cf. 1988b: 468–9) while cooperating with others. If asked why he holds all this, Chomsky must provide some justification, and, given that his biologically based rational ist conception of mind and its capacities seems to be well-founded and his linguistics makes an important contribution to understanding why and how humans are unique , a plausible route is to seek justification in known, discernible features of human nature and its ‘instincts’, prominently language. Chomsky grants that there is some connection between his work in linguistics and his politics. Resp onding to a hostile French inte rviewer, he began by saying that there was “no connection” between his political and scientific views, but continued, “apart from some very tenuous relations at an abstract level, for example, with regard to a concept of human freedom that anim ates both endeavors” (1988b: 318). In general, anyone who, like Chomsky , adop ts Enlightenment ideals must hope to show that he can appeal to properties of human nature to underwrite moral and political decisions. The connection may not be deductive: “I wish it were possible, as it obviously is not, to deduce from our understanding of human nature that the next stage in social evolution ought to be such and such” (1988b: 245). But there had better be some connection. Some philosophers will object to proceeding in this way at all with what they call a “naturalistic fallacy”: you mustn't argue from natu re to value. But even if you like that kind of criticism, proceeding through needs sets it aside. Chomsky adopts a principle so obvious that it is dif ficult to deny (it is a basic assumption of Failed States ): a good pol ity must satisfy fundamental nee ds. It is hard to deny . But how does one decide on these needs? The needs of human nature Near the end of 1970's “Langu age and Freedom,” Chomsky asks how a science of human nature that discovers and establishes the fundamental properties of the human mind – among others, the language faculty in all its detail – might have a bearing on matters of freedom and action. As always, he expresses puzzlement about how language and freedom might be related, but he writes these few intriguing sentences: Conceivably , we might … develop a social science based on empirically well-founded pr opositions conce rning human nature. Just as we study the range of humanly attainable lang uages, with some success, we might also try to study the forms of artistic expression or , for that matter, scientific knowledge that humans can conceive, and perhaps even the range of ethical systems and social structures in which humans can live and function, given their intrinsic capacities and needs. Perhaps one might go on to project a concept of socia l or ganization that would – un der given conditions of material and spiritual culture – best encourage and accommodate the fundamenta l human need – if such it is – for spontaneous initiative, creative work, solidarity , pursuit of social justice. (1987: 155) Ignoring until later what a new social science might be, let us examine the list o f fundamental needs in the last sentence and ask how Cho msky could choose such a specific list and justify his choice. He says that humans need “spontaneous initiative, creative work, solidarity , pursuit of social justice.” The list is not canonical. In other places he says that freedom is the fundamental human need – often, though, in the form of a ne ed for “free and creative activity .” In different contexts, he emphas izes solidarity . In 1969's “Some Tasks for the Left,” in the course of rejecting calls from some on the radical left for revolution with little thought for its aftermath, Chomsky insists that one must pursue a “new social order ,” building his argument on the claim that “compassion, so lidarity, friendsh ip are also human needs. They are driving needs, no less than the desire to increase one's share of commo dities or to improve workin g conditions. Beyond this, I do not doubt that it is a fundamental human need to take an active part in the democratic control of social institutions” (1981b 224). Emphasizing freedom again, but relating it to solidarity , in 1971 Chomsky quotes Russell: “ ‘There can be no real freedom or democracy’, Russell wrote, ‘until the men who do the work in a business also control its management.’ ” Chomsky continues: Socialism will be achieved on ly insofar as all social institu tions, in particular the central industrial, commercial, and financial institutions of a mode rn society , are placed under democratic control in a federal industrial repub lic of the sort that Russell and others envisio ned, with actively functioning workers' councils and other self-governing units in which each citizen, in Thomas Jefferson's words, will be “a direct participator in the government of af fairs.” (1971: 61) Should we add control of management of production to the list of fundamental human needs? Arguably, this specific a need is not a direct product of human nature but arises only in an industrialized economy with forms of social or ganization that require coordination of one person's work with another's, including under “coordination” various conside rations such as co ntrol of resources, distribution of goods, and avoidance of oversupply . It would be more accurate to say that in an industrialized society one or more fundamental human needs expr ess themselves in a need for the worker to control management. This grants that control of management of production is a need for those in an industrialized society but leaves open what the fundamental needs that express themselves this way are. In this case, they are plausibly those contained in Chomsky's conception of freedom: it is likely that control of one's workplace and production (direct participation in the government of industrial affairs) is a specific expression of one or mor e of the funda mental needs for “spontaneous initiative, creative work.” More generally , we get a plausible assumption: fundamental needs can express themselves in a variety of ways in different circumstances. To clarify matters, consider the status of needs. It is unlikely that Chomsky seriou sly thinks of human needs – whether fundamental or not – as somehow lodged in a ‘need box’ in the mind. It is much more likely, given the architecture of the mind outlined before, that he wou ld hold that all needs arise from the basic structure of the mind and its vario us faculties when it is pl aced within a particular set of physical and social circumstances and presented with the task of coping with them – with the world that that set of circumstances presents. In the political domain, this is some circumstance-focused form of commonsense world as understood through commo nsense understanding. In (1988b: 145), in the context of a discussion of how a mind with limited faculties and capacities not only provides great advantages to humans but undermines the plasticity claims of behaviorism, he says: “Naturally I hope that it will turn out that there are intrinsic structures determining human need and fulfillment of human need.” On this way of looking at it, human nature, in the form of various faculties arrang ed and interconnected as they are, “determines” – under given circumstances – what counts as need and as fulfillment of need. (Needs for food and reproduction are not specifically human needs; the fundamental human needs are, plausibly , those due to the distinctive human mind.) In effect, needs arise when minds with a given set of faculties and structure confron t specific contingencies of life. If so, the various needs that humans have in various circumstances are likely to display a relatively stable p attern, for , even though circumstances change, the human nature represented by the mind remains the same. Needs should, then, be detectable by looking at what people get fulfillment or satisfaction from. Chomsky undou btedly has been looking to satisfactions to decide upon a list o f needs when, in discussing moral, political, and aesthetic “instincts,” he appea ls to history for evidence of how people secure satisfactions over time. Think of satisfaction of distinctively human needs as providing distinctively human forms of self-fulfillment. Fundamental human needs would then be those in which any human being finds fulfillment of the relevant sort over history: uniformity in intellectual, moral, aesthetic, and/or social an d politic al forms of satisfaction over time would suggest that one is on the trail of a distinctively human need – one that very likely relates to the list of cultural novelties found in the ‘great leap forward’. With this kind of data and some observations made above and below in mind, I suggest tentatively that Chomsky's list o f fundamental human needs be reduced to two. One is freedom, which is satisfied in various ways – creative work, spontaneous initiative, play , conversation, poetry , and the like – generally , then, what he calls “free and creative activity.” It is found in autonomous thought and action and represent s the individualistic aspect of human needs. The othe r is community or association under conditions of freedom. This is satisfied in friendship, solidarity , compassion, pursuit of social justice, fellowship, sympathy , support, nurture, love, companionship. It is the social aspect: satisfaction is found in association and cooperation involving friends, industry , team, township, neighborhood, village, etc. Compressing the list o f needs to two that represent social and individual aspects distorts to a degree. It might also app ear to set up an opposition within human nature itself – the need to be uni que versus the need to be social, something Chomsky would not want. Among other things, it does not make much sense to think in terms of purely individual satisfactions: an individual's satisfaction in work well done o r a product well made has its so cial side in acknowledgment and perhaps praise by others, as well as in recognition that one has made a contribution to others. But the regimentation of fers a way to or ganize Chomsky's list of needs and at the same time present a tentative hypothesis about the fundamental human needs. Emphasizing both an individual and a social aspect also makes sense of why Chomsky endorses anarchosyndicalism, or libertarian socialism, not anarchism-lib ertarianism alone, or syndicalism-socialism alone. It is because human satisfactions – and thus needs – have both individual and social aspects. Neither of these (tentatively suggested) basic needs comes close to acknowledging control of others (domination). As we have seen, Chomsky considers domin ation pathological. Perhaps it is a perversion of the need to control o ne's affairs: for many today , perhaps, an outcome of a strategy to do what authority demands (including harming others) in order to attain a position in or remain within an authoritarian structure, such as a corporation, so that one can gain some degree of control oneself. 6 That it is a pe rversion is plausible, assuming that humans have a need for community and solidarity , and I add further reasons to take it seriously later. What about (unrestrict ed) accumulation? He writes of a “desire to in crease one's share of commodities” as a “ driving need” (1981b: 224). Had he said “[driving] desire for one's share of commodities,” there would be no problem; it would fit with the n eed for community . It is possibl e, however , to read “desire to increase one's share of commodities” as a desire for unlimited accumulation in the “economic man” sense – in effect, greed. And that poses a puzzle: is he acknowledging that humans have a fundamental and distinctively human need for unlimited accumulation, perhaps expressed in a particular case as a need to be envied by others for one's riches? Whether there is such a fundamental need, and whether it is distinctively human, are empirical issues, to be decided on the facts. It is, then, a useful test case, for if this “driving desire to increase on e's share of commodities” amounts to a desire for unlimited accumulation, and if this driving desire is distinctively human, it would seem to provide some support for a neoliberal vision of an ideal society . Before dealing with this, we need to look more closely at the historical and anthropological evidence that Cho msky of fers for the hypothesis that freedom and community are fundamental human needs. In the argument leading up to the “Language and Freedom” quotation, Chomsky summarizes observations of human action and motivation made by other rationalist/romantic thinkers. This tradition focuses on freedom and sees the satisfactions of exercising freedom in self-r espect when exercising one's own freedom and admiration in the case of others. The implicit assumption is that persons who have sold out – who have chosen rewards from authority over freedom and autonomy – recognize that they have don e so and that, while they may try to justify what they have done by listing rewards received and treating them as accomplishments, these claims ring hol low . They do not respect themselves; nor can they command admiration: one might envy the riches and power , but not admire the person. 7 Chomsky quotes Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality : they do nothing but boast incessantly of the peace and repose they enjoy in their chains … But when I see … others sacrifice pleasures , repose, wealth, power , and life itself for the preservation of this sole good which is so disdained by those who have lost it; … when I see multitudes of entirely naked savages scorn European voluptuousness an d endure hunger , fire, the sword, and death to preserve only their independence, I feel that it does not behoove slaves to reason about freedom. (Quoted in Chomsky 1987: 144) Kant makes similar claims in arguing in favor of the French Revolution after the Terror had begun. Responding to complaints by thos e who said that the Terror showed that those who rebelled were not “ripe for freedom,” he said: If one accepts this assumption, freedom will never be achieved; for one can not arrive at the maturity for freedom without having already acquired it; one must be free to learn how to make use of one's powers freely an d usefully. … To accep t the principle that freedom is worthless for those under one's control and that one has the right to refuse it to them forever , is an inf ringement on the rights of God himself, who has created man to be free. (Quoted ibid.) Self-respect and admiration are here being used to justify revo lution and its after people's needs for these override concerns even for their survival. Chomsky notes that Humboldt makes freedom out to be the “first and indispensable co ndition” of self-fulfillment and self-development. Freedom is not granted when one is “ripe ” for it; it has to be exercised from within. Humboldt ar gues that it is lodged in “the very nature of man. The incapacity for freedom can only arise from a want of moral and intellectual power; to heighten this power is the only way to supply this want; but to do this presupposes the exercise of the power , and this exercise presupposes the freedom which awakens spontaneous activity” (1987: 148). Nevertheless, “a variety of situations” is needed for its stimulation and development. Education plays a role – not education as indoctrination, but education as providing opportunities for the exercise of freedom. The common theme in these ob servations is that people need to exercise freedom in order to develop as people – as free agents. Positi ve evidence that there is a need for freedom built into human nature is found in the rejection of slavery, the facts of revolution against authority , and the awakening of powers of self-understanding, self-development, and self- fulfillment throu gh education that refuses to instill and control but rather occasions and invites, to use Cudworth's phrase. The satisfactions of community or association under conditions of freedom are suf ficiently obvious; they need less attention. They are found in working together , solidarity in performing a task, conversation and gossip, teamwork, comm unity projects, joint planning, friendship, love, and so on. Denial of these satisfactions leads to alienation, loneliness, and disaffection. Like Humboldt and unlike Rousseau, Chomsky is not a primitive individualist. He holds with Humboldt that “[t]he isolated man is no more able to develop than the one who is fettered” (1987: 152). But if humans need community as well as freedom, Chomsky claims, the comm unity must be one of “free association without coercion by the state or other authoritarian institutions,” a form of free association where “free men can create and inquire, and achieve the highest development of their powers” (ibid.) – in effect, a form of association that is Chomsky's prefer red form of social or ganization, anarchosyndicalism. In Western states, he claims, elements of this form of free association are found, for example, in guarantees of individual rights. Hints about what such a form of free association would look like are found “in the Israeli Kibbutzim; in the experiments with workers' coun cils in Yugoslavia; in the effort to awaken popular consciousness and create a new involvement in the social process which is a funda mental element in the ‘Third World’ revolutions, coexisting uneasily with indefensible authoritarian practice” (ibid.). Chomsky allows that in special circumstances the “instincts” for freedom and solidarity might be forbidde n expression in self-fulfillment because of a need for survival, thereby making a person's actions inhuman an d – in these special circumstances – less responsible and accountable. Mo st people in modern industrialized democracies are not in these circumstances. He illustrates: “I've very rarely talked about atrocities committed by soldiers. … The reason is that soldiers, in a situation of conflict, are frightened. The options open to them are few. They can be enraged. These are situations in which p eople can't use their no rmal human instincts” (1988b: 772). This excuse is not open to those in democracies. In an article in the New Y ork Review of Books o n the My Lai incident, in which US soldiers slaughtered civilians in Vietnam, he wrote three sentences pointing out that no one could say much that was sensible about the actions of a bunch of “half- crazed GIs in the field” and about their responsibilities. He remarks: The much more serious question, I think, is how people who are subject to no threat, who are comfortable, educated and if they don't know what's going on it's because of a cons cious decision not to know what's going on, how such pe ople can, in the quiet of their living rooms, tolerate and support and back horrifying atrocities, and plan them in their well- appointed of fices. That's the real evil, far worse than what's done by soldiers in the field. (ibid.) Those not in combat sitting at home in a democratic state can exercise their mo ral instincts. They are more responsible for the atrocit ies than the soldier in the field. They were in a position to reject the policie s that led to the atrocities. This is related to a general claim about the nature of evil: it can be institutionalized and, when it is, it leads to results far worse than those perpetrated by the occasional evil individual. Chomsky notes that while individual humans are capable of evil actions, they are also capable of good. They have “lots of capacities and options.” Problems arise when those capacities and options are channeled in such a way that they emphasize those that lead to causing harm. War would be one example. It is possible even to conceive of institutional war. “If we had institutions which permitted patho logical killers free rein, they'd be running the place. The only way to survive would be to let those elements of your nature [presumably , an instinct for survival, and not essentially human] manifest themselves” (1988b: 773). These o bservations about the role of institutions with regard to needs complement a passage that suggests a picture of needs that supports the idea that in addition to freedom and community , the “driving need” to accumulate (which, if unlimited, is greed) is among fundamental needs. If we have insti tutions which make greed out to be the sole pr operty of human beings and encourage pure greed at the expense of other human emotions and commitments, we're going to have a society based on greed, with all that follows. A different society might be or ganized in such a way that human feelings and emotions of other sorts, say solidarity , support, sympathy , become dominant. Then you'll have different aspects of human nature and personality revealing themselves. (ibid.) On o ne reading, the picture is this: humans have various needs, o nly some of which will be revealed (allowed expression in satisfactions) by particular institutions. But, presumably , if a need is revealed, it is ‘there’ from the start. So, if unlimited accumulation is encouraged by some institutions, it must be among the needs that are ‘there’ in human nature. If so, however , the default strategy returns the result that the ideal form of social or ganization sho uld provide for the satisfaction of a central ‘value’ of chapter 7 's economic man. Clearly, Chomsky would not want this result. Not only does it of fer some support to institutions that provide for the satisfaction of greed (although not for everyon e, obviously) but, by the same argument, domination of others (which Chomsky takes to be pathological) ends up amon g the needs ‘there’ in human nature too, and the default strategy provides justification for at least one “market ideal.” Indeed, any satisfaction encoura ged by any historical institution will end up among the needs ‘there’ in human nature. The result is hardly different fro m Michel Foucault's view that institutions make ne eds. But wanting to reject the result and actually doing so are very different. The argument must rest on empirical, naturalistic grounds. Let us see if more data might support a dif ferent picture. In (1 988a) Chomsky looks at what certainly should be a relevant form of human behavior – moral judgment and moral argument – and at the range of agreements and disagreements allowed within it. He poin ts out that moral argument is “not always pointless, merely a matter of ‘I assert this’ and ‘yo u assert that’ ” (1988a: 152). It is not, then, merely relative – a matter of what society one happens to be in or what one's individual interests happen to be. If so, it is plausible to postulate a common basis to all human moral systems. The argument is like other POS arguments that take observations provided by common sense and appeal to inner capacities and faculties to make sense of these data. “The acquisition o f a specific moral and ethical system, wide ranging and often precise in its consequences, cannot simply be the result of ‘shaping’ and ‘control’ by the social environment” (1988a: 15 2–3). That is, particular systems involve a highly specific texture and structure – what is right and wrong, what one's obligations are, to whom one is responsible, what kinds of excuses are permitted, what is just – and while one finds diversity, it is hardly credible that a system o f rights and ob ligations, permissions and excuses, that is acquired as readily by children as human moral/ethical systems seem to be is learned by som e generalized learning procedure or induced by some form of training. Apparently , as in the case of language, the environment is far too impoverished and indeterminate to provide this system to the child, in its full richness and applicability . Knowing little about the matter, we are com pelled to speculate; but it certainly seems reasonable to speculate that the moral and ethical system acquired by the child owes much to som e innate human faculty. The environmen t is relevant, as is the case of language, vision, and so on; thus we can find individual and cultural divergence. But there is surely a common basis, rooted in our nature. (1988a: 153) One of Chomsky 's favorite examples – he uses it in several of his writings and interviews – is a case of conver gence in moral judgment and argument concerning slavery that seems to indicate that freedom is a need of all human beings and domination is not – that it really is pathological. The example also seems to support a picture that justifies some institutions as clearly morally better than others, a picture that is different from the one above. He remarks: “Not long ago, slavery was considered legitimate, even estimable; slave owners did not characteristically regard what they were doing as wrong but rather saw it as a proof of their high moral values. Their arguments were, furthermore, not absurd, though we now regard them as morally grotesque” (ibid.). Slave-owners in the early years o f industrialization argued that if a person owned a piece of machinery , he or she would be more likely to care for it than the person who ren ted one for temporary use – as with wage slaves. “Th e argument was that it woul d have been improper to allow the slaves to be free. They were much better of f if their owners were able to take care of them” (1988b: 469). Chomsky then claims that, since the time when arguments like this were taken seriously and accepted, there has been an observa ble form of moral progress that is reflected in conver gence of moral judgments that reject the earlier argument: “No sane person would now accept this argument, though it is not enti rely absurd by any means. As civilization progressed, it came to be understood that slavery is an infringement on essential human rights,” so the slave-owner's argument would no longer be accepted by any decent person. Everyone has the right to be free. Chomsky hopes fo r more progress in what he think of as the same directio n: “W e may look forward to the day when wage slavery and the need to rent oneself to survive may be seen in a similar light, as we come to have better understanding of the moral values rooted in our inner nature” (1988a: 153). To clarify “moral values roote d in our inner nature” we can look to (1988b), in which Chomsky presents the same illustration, makes a similar remark about moral progres s consisting in coming to a “better understanding of the moral values rooted in our inner nature,” but then adds a point about “natural morality .” Speaking of slave-owners who provided moral justifications for keeping slaves, he says: The peo ple who put this forth were civilized people, but now from our point of view, they're moral monsters. And, in fact, from the point of view of a natural morality , they were moral monsters, except that moral and cultural evolution had not reached the point where they could perceive that. I'm sure that the same is true about us today . If history goes on for another hundred years, … I imagine that people will be looking back to practice s that we accep t and condone and will regard them as morally monstrous. (1988b: 469) He p redicts that “wage slavery” will be seen as among these practices: that we will find it too to be an infringement of “fundamental human rights.” The picture that emerges from this is that there is a natural morality that requires satisfaction of distinctively human needs (including freedom) for everyone , and that it is correct and applies even if societal practices make it difficult to realize what that natural morality is, thereby making it appear deniable and perhaps even wrong. Evidence from data of both mo ral structure and moral progress certainly suggests that there is a fixed fo rm of human nature that some institutions serve better than others. And evidence from the slavery example – that decent people would now reject out of hand the slave-owner's justification for enslaving humans – suggests again that domination is not a fundamental need. Still further evidence is provided by the fact that even now very few, if any , would count wage slavery as a morally justifiable form of human behavior; we seem already to recognize that “natural morality” rules it out, for it is a form of domination – of some controlling the lives of others. Let us take the case against domination as overwhelming. What, then, of o ur test case, unrestricted accumulation of commodities – greed? It is no t difficult to imagine morally justifying accumulating commodities in the event of disaster, loss of income, provision for children or paren ts, loss of capacity , and so on. These kinds of activities can be seen to satisfy a need to survive – surely a fundamental need, if not a distinctively human one. But it is difficult to imagine moral justification for accumulation without appeal to provision for survival in conditions of equality . Nor can one simply ignore justification. Even the slave-owner in of fering his “better treatment” argument recognized that. Without justification – or without an argument that seems to provide it – one loses dignity and self-respect and per haps even becomes a moral mo nster . Moral justification must, however , proc eed in the public domain, universalize, and aim towards agreement (C&M: ch. 18). Assuming this, anyone who accumulates must justify doing so to others living in an environment with limited resources. It is extremely unlikely , then, that one could morally justify greed or accumulation for its own sake, any more than one could justify domination as a way to satisfy the need for freedom. This casts a different light on what Chomsky called the “driving need to increase one's share of commodities.” The “driving need” is survival, and it expresses itself in accumulation, some of which can be justified, although greed cannot. Both greed and domi nation distort natural morality; they are pathological. An d, returning to an earlier point, institutions that enshrine “market discipline” and condone and even celebrate this pathology are more evil than the occasional pa thological individual. On this picture, there ‘are’ fundamental human nee ds, and human beings – with a natural morality or something like a ‘mo ral or gan’ among their natural endowments – cannot have unlimited accumulation among the needs that are both natural and human . Further, presumably the existence of a natural morality and its expression in fundamental human needs – no doubt those related to community – can be used to justify some institutions over others. Moreover , with these endowments, humans can make moral progress – though as Chomsky's remark about human evolution indicates, this is not guaranteed. Recent efforts by John Mikhail (201 1) and others have pro duced compelling evidence of a natura l morality – and a natural notion of justice that as it happens is reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in commonsense morality , and to a degree in legal systems. This evidence indicates that there is a moral faculty of a definable sort oper ating in the mind, an d show s that an inhere nt and native notion of fairness (cf. Rawls 1958; 1971) rules out greed as a distinctively human need. Adopting the view that there is a moral faculty and that it is clearly distinct from the language faculty raises questions about the strong thesis with which we began. It may be that it must be abandoned, although at little cost, so far as the rationalist is concerned: if there are two, or more, faculties unique to humans, so be it. They too will help ‘determine’ distinctively human needs. But it is not clear that it must be abandoned yet. For one thing , the moral faculty is not completely independent of the language faculty. In order to operate and apply to human actions, a moral faculty as described by Mikhail operates over ‘inputs’ consisting of descriptions of complex human actions. The language faculty would of fer these in the form of SEMs that combine action-concepts with circumstance ones in complex forms. If that is co rrect, a mor al faculty relies essentially on language, and could not have come in to place prior to its introduction. For another , the science of the moral faculty is only in its initial stages, and it is not yet obvious that morality of the sort found among humans is absent in other creatures. Attempts to show that it is continuous with the ‘reciproca l altruism’ displayed by apes and some ot her creatures (you scratch my back/groom my fleas and I'll scratch your back/groom your fleas), due to Robert Trivers (1971) and othe rs, are no doub t inadequate because they fail to deal with the universality (across the human species) found in human mo ral claims.8 But evidence from primate research may yet show analogues or even homologues. So the strong thesis remains in place, at least for the moment. And, assuming that the language faculty plays a necessary role in the operations of moral computations – and perhaps even in the universality of moral claims – its contribution s to yielding distinctively human needs is assured. The cor rectness of this picture of needs and its ability to app eal to the default strategy to project a vision of an ideal form of social o rganization and justify some institutions over others depends on whether it provides a better empirical account than the other picture. There is always uncertainty in empirical matters, of course; but there is even more here because of the massive amount s of data needed , the lack of a completed science of human nature, the nascent status of a science of a moral faculty, the fact that needs are not in a ‘ne ed box’ but arise in circumstances, and the difficulty of disentangling fact from ideology . It is sufficiently important to Chomsky to establish the picture on empiric al grounds, however , that, I suggest, he has tried to do so fo r most of his career – with considerable success. One can think of his political talks and efforts to ‘retrieve history’ as a form of consciousness-raising. The fact that so many people in a diverse set of cultures respond to his efforts with agreement and a will to try to do something about current circumstances is an indication of that success. The relativist's challenge, the new social science, and projection Unlike Plato, Chomsky does not try to provide a non-naturalistic grounding for his vision of the good society but rather one based on empirical data and empirically justified theories – currently , on available natural science and commonsense-based data and a plausible view of the mind, but eventually , perhaps, with the aid of a biolog ically based theory of human nature and all its components. Because he wants to provide a naturalistic argument, he must, unlike Plato, reject moral relativism on naturalistic and empirical grounds. The problem – as is evident from the discussion of the last few pages – is that discerning patterns and defending one account of them as opposed to another is not easy and relies on distinctions that can be challenged. Where Chomsky sees moral progress, the relativist claims to see only changes in ‘moral’ evaluation. Where he sees some satisfactions as satisfactions of fundamental needs and others as pathological perversions, the relativist would claim to see undistinguishable pleasures. Where he sees evidence of a fixed human nature with a moral component, the relativist sees the drifts and currents of historical change. One of the mo st interesting of Chomsky's encounters with a moral relativist is that with Foucault in 1971, in a debate on the top ic “Human Nature: Justice versus Power .” In that debate, Foucault replies to Chomsky's attempt to construct naturalistic arguments in the moral domain by claiming that moral concepts such as justice are all relative, mere artifacts. I will be a little bit Nietzschean about this: … it seems to me that the idea of justice … is an idea which in effect has been invented and put to work in different types of societies as an instrument of a certain pol itical and economic power or as a weapon against that power . But it seems to me that, in any case, the notion of justice itself functions within a society of classes as a claim made by the oppressed class and as justification for it. (Elders 1974: 184–5) The remark “and as justification for it” might suggest that Foucault is willing to allow that not only do members of an oppressed class appeal to a concept of justice to justify revo lution, but they in fact offer a justification for revolution when they do. But it soon becomes clear that he has nothing like this in mind; if a concept of justice is an artifact of a society (“is … invented”), the most that members of an oppressed class could do is use the concept as a form of persuasion, where persuasion is nothing more than another form of power or coercion. That for Foucault there is no independent concept of justice to which one can appeal is clear from his statement that notions of human nature, of justice, of the realization of the essence of human beings, are all notions and concepts which have been formed within our civilization, within our type of knowledge and our form of philosophy , and that as a result form part of our class system … [O]ne can't, however regrettable it may be, put forward these notions to describe or justify a fight which should – and shall in pr inciple – overthrow the very fundaments of our society . This is an extrapolation for which I can't find the historical justification. ( Elders 1974: 187) Generalizing to other moral principles, including the principle on which the default strategy rests, it follows that no social change can, strictly speaking, be said to be an improvement or to result in a better form of society , for there is no independent measure of what a good so ciety is. So, in the final anal ysis, there is no independent justification for revolution or change; revolution and change are just matters of one power usurping another , established power . Chomsky replies: “I really disagree. I think there is some sort of an absolute basis … ultimately residing in fundamental human qualities, in terms of which a ‘real’ notion of justice is grounded.” He points out that even in today's society there is an embodiment of a “kind of groping towards the true, humanly valuable concepts of justice and decency , … which I think are real,” and follo ws this with an expression of hope that in a future society , whatever element s of justice and decency can be found “will come closer to incorporating a defense of fundamental human needs, including such needs as those for solidarity and sympathy” (Elders 1974: 185). His remarks presuppose that, even though our current notion of justice and our current understanding of human needs are far from perfect, they can be justified, and that in proposing that one move to a better – here, more just – society , one is not merely mouthing words as a preface to bringing out the cannon, but stating on the basis of the best evidence available that what one proposes is justified. Comparison with Foucault is in teresting for two reasons. First, he has an explanation of sorts for why pe ople construct moral arguments in the way they do. Second – and much more important, as it turns out – his detailed work on the concept of madness relies heavily on historical data, which is just the kind of data that Chomsky appeals to in order to defend some needs as fundamental human needs, but he came to a differen t, relativist conclusion. The first is less important because, in the absence of a response to POS observations in the moral domain and the growing evidence for a moral faculty as among the n atural endowments of human beings, the “Nietzschean” principle that moral values and moral justifications are artifacts of power and authority relations amounts only to badly motivated stipulation. The second is more important, because it makes an opposing claim on what purport to be empirical grounds. This is why the empirically based argument presented in the previous section is so imp ortant to Chomsky's project. Someone could rightly object that very little data was taken into conside ration there compared, for example, to the mass that Fouc ault of fers in several books. One response consists of pointing out that what is at stake here is what data is for . For Chomsky , data can only be evaluated for its value in supporting or rejecting an hypothesis in the science of mind and human nature. Foucault did not engage issues by using the methods of natural science; it was for him enough to persuade and convince by whatever means – a use of power and authority – which is far from employing the tools of natural science. Clearly, he is himself convinced ahead of time that there can be no such thing as an obje ctive science of the mind and human nature, and has little appreciation for – or understanding of – what Chomsky had accomplished even by the early 1970s. Another respon se is to discuss more data. And that is exactly what Chomsky has been doing in his political works, amassing material from history , sociolog y, anthropology , and economics (see, for example, one of many sources, Ferguson (1995).) More important, he has been doing this against a backdrop of an improving science of langua ge and an independently justifiable, biolo gically oriented, rationalist view of the human mind. He has, then, without calling it that, been develop ing what in “Language and Freedom” he called a social science that would “study the forms of artistic expression or , for that matter, scientific kno wledge that humans can conceive, and perhaps even the range of ethical systems and social structures in which humans can live and function, given their intrinsic capaciti es and needs,” and on that basis has projected an ideal form of social or ganization. If this is so, Chomsky did not suggest a new social science in the late 1960s and early 1970s just to drop the idea, but has been advancing the social science he suggested all along. With the aid of a large network of individuals, he has gathered detailed economic, social, and cultural information and, with the aid of collaborators such as Edward Herman, has presented it in texts, speeches, and interviews, providing information about what people do and think now , as well as the history of what people have done and thought, to get a grip on what they consider acceptable behavior and the ways they are prepared to justify it. He has suggested what he thinks the fundamental human needs are. And he has projected an ideal form of social or ganization. These are empirical proposals and the data is brought to bear on the proposals. One measure of the success of these proposals is whether, after looking at the data and (relatively thin) an alysis Chomsky of fers, one agrees that an anarchosyndicalist policy or pra ctice is obviously better than another policy or p ractice. Put it this way: if you agree that the Brazilian bishops' proposal for how to or ganize media in society (to respect freedom and cooperative decision-making) is better than what one finds in corporate-run democracies, if you agree that the intellectual's responsibilities include providing correc t information to others even if it undermines co rporate and government aims, and if you agree that moral justification by appeal to sheer gain or to domination is patholo gical, you have come to agree with Chomsky's assessment of fundamental human needs and, given the principle behind the default argument, their implications. Crucially, you have co me to these conclusion s not by being told that you must believe them, or by an effort to overpower your critical faculties with mystification and ‘expertise’, but by exercising your critical sense and using native common sense – aided, though , by some knowledge of an independently justifiable althou gh still young science of human nature. That is why it is plausible to maintain not only that these conclusions are reasonable, given the data, but that others exercising their native cognitive powers ought to accept them too – provisionally , of course, as with any conclusion reached by empirical ar gument. Arguably, Chom sky's new social science and its methods rep resent the best form o f rational argument that one can now hope for in the socioeconomic domain. It appeals to a developing science of human nature, including now proposals concerning a moral faculty , and welcomes as much data as can be provided, to the extent that they can be brought to bear on specific proposa ls and hypotheses. To that extent, it combines theory and practice. It relies on a principle concerning satisfying needs that is hard to deny , an d rests on argument techniques as old as common sense and as new as those found in a developing science of mind. Showing that it is the best is beyond the scope of this book; all I have done is indicate Chomsky's response to Foucault's rival view. This is not to say that the form has been executed as well as it could be. Its execution can be improved with more data, mo re careful data gathering methods, and more science of mind. But that should go without saying. There are important differences between Chomsky's new social science and current understandings of social science. For one thing, his version abandons the idea that the goal of social science is to “exp lain human behavior” in the sense of pre dicting it (typically accompanied by the suggestion that one can then control it). For another , it is fully compatible with a fixed human nature, unlike the idea that human nature might be plastic. Furthermore, it is not committed to the limited and distorting concept of rationality embedded in “rational choice theory .” It also differs in that it makes no pretense to being unwilling to speak to the matter of values. It does, of course, aim towards as much objectivity as one can currently hope for in the domain of human action and behavior , where this is obtained by taking into account as much data as possible over as long a time as possible, while emplo ying as good statistical techniques as are available. But objectivity in this sense has nothing to do with being value- free. The new social science both takes values (“ethical systems”) to be within its subject matter and, in relying on the principle that connects fundamental human needs to ideal forms of social or ganization, takes projection of an ideal form of social or ganization to be part of its task. In doing the latter, it openly engage s in empirically based moral argument, not persuasion and advocacy . Orwell's problem Why do neoliberal ideals and policies continue to be taken seriously? Perhaps Orwell of fers some answers. “Orwell's problem,” unlike Plato's problem (the acquisition issue), is not a serious intellectual problem (cf. Chomsky 198 6: xxix). But it is a seriou s practical pro blem that calls for effort and a willingness to overco me illusion. It is, Chomsky says suggestively, “an analogue in the domain of social and political life of what might be called ‘Freud's problem’ ” (1986: xxv). If this is so, it is a social and political version of the issue of how people manage to deceive themselves about themselves – the devices that lead to inattention, prejudice, bias, and the like. Chomsky puts it this way: Plato's problem … is to explain how we know so much, given that the evidence available to us is so sparse. Orwell's problem is to explain why we know and understand so little, even though the evidence available to us is so rich. Like many other twentieth-century intellectuals, Orwell was impressed with the ability of totalitarian systems to instill beliefs that are firmly held and widely accepte d although they are completely without foundation and often plainly at variance with obvious facts about the world around us. The problem is far broader , as the history of religious dogma suf fices to show . (1986: xxvii) Chomsky's understanding of Orwell's problem is that adherence to what is obviously unjus t represents a kind of secular faith, an unreasoning form of loyalty to one's nation or ‘people’ characteristic of tribalism and its modern form, nationalism. To underm ine this unreasoning faith and solve the problem, one has to analyze the mechanisms that bring it about – the psychological/social/political devices that induce it and maintain it. These mechanisms are open to view to anyone with commonsense und erstanding. Children have no difficulty reco gnizing favoritism, bias, prejud ice, and the workings of power and authority . Applying these concepts to social and political life and discerning the mechanisms involved might take more effort, but no adult is incapable of doing these things, if they are critical and rely on universalizable standards , treating one's own case the way one treats others'. Detecting the mechanisms employed in non-totalitarian societies requires more work and, apparently , more effort to overcome. In totalitarian societies, mechanisms of control are straightforward: governm ents induce conformity and obedience by force or the threat of force. As Hume noted in his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion , the threat of punishment for not conforming to the tenets of the faith – trial, torture, exclusion, and (according to some doctrines) eternal punishment after death – proves powerful. Rational argument is unnecessary; people conform. In Western democracies, direct threat of injury or punishment is excluded. Intriguingly , though, it turns o ut that rational argument plays no role here either. If it did, people would see the untruths and faulty reasoning for what they are and, if rational, would not be taken in. Various non-violent forms of non-rational persuasion and control have come into use, in ways that Orwell did not anticipate. They consist in the creation of illusions – for example, fostering the illusion of a free, democratic press, vigorously devoted to in forming the citizen o f “all the news that's fit to print.” To foster the illusion, debate of a very restricted sort is permitted and performed in a ritualistic manner: the press debates solemnly whether they are “too free.” But there is no investigation of the means by which conformity is induced, and – crucially – no questioning of the basic presuppositions that define the secular faith. Orwell did not anticipate the degree of success of non-violent thought control exercised through the press, through the technique s of an ad industry , and through spin. Even among those who declare themselves the most free of ind octrination – intellectuals who have access to information, freedom to pursue more information, and opportunity to reflect – one finds, with too few exceptions, obedience and conformity to the state religion. One of the mo re intriguing of Chomsky's thousands of examples of conformity is his comparison o f US intellectuals' reactions to Soviet radio newscaster Vladimir Danchev's denunciation of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan on Moscow radio five times during a week in May 1983 with their reactions to the US's invas ion of Vietnam. It lies in the background of the discussion at the end of the previous chapter . We saw the in consistency – pr aise from US intellectuals for Danchev and other Soviet dissidents and not a word about their own Afghanistan, Vietnam. Notice that reason plays no role in explaining this difference in reaction; reason requires a consistent reaction, or what was earlier described as the reaction one ought to have to Iraq's invasion, given that one approves of Danchev's actions. Notice too that the US inte llectual was perfectly able to assess the facts of the case of Afghanistan, as was Danchev , and to come to Danchev's conclusion, with all its moral burden. It was clear to Danchev that the invasion was immoral, and he rightly condemned it. And any number of US intellectuals correctly and quic kly came to the same conclusion as Danchev; it was obvious to anyone o f reason. So US intellectuals should be equally capable of looking at the facts in the case of Vietnam (or Iraq, etc.), of coming to the conclusion that the US invaded Vietnam (Iraq, etc.), and of accepting the moral burden of informing others of this. Yet with Vietnam (and with only slight improvem ents with Iraq), except for Chomsky and a few others, very few US intellectuals and no mainstream press drew the conclusion and accepted the burden. This is not selective blindness or refusal to draw a simple conclusion in one's own case; it is not “Freud's problem.” There are parallels, but it is in many respe cts more puzzling. It is selective blindness and refusal to draw a simple conclusion on the part of a group of intellectuals with the tools and opportunity to seek the truth and make the judgments, who consistently and uniformly do not do so. The solu tion to Orwell's problem, unlike Plato's problem, does not require the cons truction of a scientific theory . It requires a practical program of “intellectual self defense” that attempts to “discover the insti tutional and other factors that block insight and understanding in crucial areas of our lives and ask why they are effective” (Chomsky 1986: xxvii). And it requires a serious effort to think of one's own nation's actions in the same way as one thinks of others' – universalizing. The challenges to doing this are not intellectual; this is not a matter of constructing a science. It is a matter of discovering and criticizing the institutional blocks that power employs. We find educational institutions that indoctrinate (provide a ‘good education’) and instill jingoist attitudes. There are government efforts to limit access to data for ‘security’ reasons and create threats (as with WikiLeaks informer Bradley Manning's incarceration). Corporations control media an d hire only those who conform to the principles of the state religion, rewarding them alone. And so on. Hume carried out an investigation of the institution of religion in his Dialogues . Chomsky's investigation of the secular religion of the state – the priests, the powers, the motives, the practices – parallels Hume's. Chomsky writes (1986: xviii): The study of Orwell's problem … is primarily a matter of accumulating evidence and examples to illustrate what should be fairly obv ious to a rational observer even on superficial inspection, to establish the conclusion that power and privilege function much as any rational mind would expect, and to exhibit the mechanisms that operate to yield the results that we observe. Tracing the origin and histor y of development and growth of the conception of “economic man” and its current embodiment in corporations with their control of Madisonian governments is an example of doing this, and it provides a key to this pa rticular form of secular religion and to the role of its secular priesthood, the serviceable intellectual. Why do es Chom sky continue to devote so much time and effort to the journeyman's intellectual task of providing information to those who need and can use it? His linguistic work would be much more than enough to occupy most people, and his continuing accomplishments in it would be more than enough to satisfy mos t. When he began devoting so much time to political analysis and critique in 1964 he had a home and a family and large numbers of students with all the obligations that these entail and – as his actions indicate – that he honore d, and even in retirement still honors. Why does he spend so much time on political and social matters? It is not to gain political power , and while it has brought him fame, he does not appear motivated to seek it. Avoiding psychological analyses and personality profiles, the simplest answer is that he is consumed to tell the truth, and to do so in a way that makes him a paradigm of the responsible intellectual, for it does not serve his interests. In this regard, I suspect he outranks Plato's Socrates . When justifying his not seeking clemency by using persuasion (not reason) to do so, Socrates argued for the immortality of the soul, and in doin g so made his commitment to telling the truth appear to be not quite unrewarded, and therefore not quite the uncompromising commitment one finds in Chomsky . Because of this, it rings a bit hollow to say that Chomsky's motivation in telling the truth is like Socrates' – Chomsky's motivation seems to be genuinely that of aiding others, not himself. Biological humanist? Even if the strong thesis (that the introduction of language alone suffices to yield all the rest of the ‘human ly distinct’ aspects of human n ature) turns out to be wrong, I suggest that there is a strong conceptual (Chomsky says “abstract”) conn ection between his work in linguistics and that in politics. As he points out himself, a notio n of freedom animates both areas of study. And there are hints in what little we know of human nature that seem to support an anarchosyndicalist ideal. The outline of the goals and pr ospects of a new social science – a very different creature from standard social science – suggests a way to establish a connection between human nature and social ideals. This new social science does not just wait for a completed science of human nature. It gathers as much data as it can about the ways humans behaved and behave now in various circumstances, and, given what we can reasona bly suppose about human na ture now , searches for patterns in these data. It adopts a reasonable principle about the relationship of fundamental human needs to the best form of social or ganization. It draws up a list of needs. Then it projects an ideal form of social or ganization as best it can. This new social science thus seems to establish as well as can now be expected a connection between what is known about a distinctive human nature (to which Chomsky's linguistics makes a crucial contribution) and a vision of an ideal form of social or ganization that creates a measure for critique an d proposals for change. Where does this new social science fit into Chomsky's in tellectual projects: is it a science, or is it ‘in’ common sense? Neither and both, I suggest; it is part of the rationalist philosopher -scientist's ef fort to bridge the two dom ains. The techniques, assumptions, and aims of this new form of social science can be identified with what a scientifically sophisticated rationalist philos opher could be expected to adopt, given the current state of knowledge, if he or she wan ted to establish a connection between a linguistics that is part of an incomplete science of human nature and political and moral ideals. The suggestion that this new social science is biological ration alism applied to the issue at hand, and that it provides the best available an swer to that issue, raises the question of whether one can ever hope to deduce what we ought to do from knowledge of what we are. This is not a prospect for the new social science. It is not, for example, a matter o f deducing the specific strategies to follow in the next few months. It is a matter of reasoning from what we know and can reasonably assume to a vision of an ideal, given the principle on which the default strategy is based. Once a vision is established, it is a matter of applying that ideal in criticism, planni ng, and action. We already can and sometimes do engage in rational argument to this end. As Chomsky emphasizes in making empirical evidence the basis of his arguments and their conclusions, to do so, we need to continually reassess our data to ensure that the list we draw up of fundamental human needs of ourselves as biophysically based creatures is correct and complete, that our principles are the best we can manage, and that what we say about human nature is right. Given this, the default strategy lets us develop a vision. If the alternative is faith and appeal to authority , our rational natures demand that we take this path. Chomsky has not added to or changed what he suggested about the form and task of a new social science since he introduced the notion in 1970. But he has since then added data an d advanced the science of human nature on which it must rest. He has done so by showing how the science of language can now realistically be accommodated to at least some aspects of the study of biolo gy. Nothing in what has been accomplished in advancing the science of human nature challenges the vision he developed. It makes it even mo re plausible. And it establishes Chomsky's credentials as what I call a “biological humanist.” Biological humanism is an updated and improved form of Enlig htenment project. Enlightenment thinkers proposed rejecting faith and illusion, relying instead entirely on empi rically based, critical, and justified forms of reasoning. We now have a clearer and better idea of what that involves. Like Hume, we have seen that faith and illusion have no rational justification, and that when they are instituted in various religions – including state religions – they serve the interests of power . We have found that human reason (problem-solving) comes in two forms: commonsense understanding and (natural) science formation, both dependent in different ways on an evolved language faculty. And we have found that these forms of problem-solv ing are likely the only ones we have: we are biologically based or ganisms and, like all such or ganisms, we have the problem-solving powers we have, nothing more. The ones we have – perhaps largely as a result of the in troduction of language to the species – give us many advantages. But in recent times, their implementation in the interests of power have also made it po ssible for us to completely destroy the environment and ourselves. One of our most pressing problems, then, is coming to conceive of and in stituting forms of social or ganization that better solve the problem of living together cooperatively and creatively (meeting our biologically based fundamental needs) in sustainable ways. Solving that problem and doing it well is the task Chomsky's new social science sets itself. When James Peck in the 1980 s asked whether Chomsky had faith in reason, Chomsky replied that he did not have faith in that or anything else (Chomsky 198 7). His view, rather, was this: reason is all we have. We are not angels. We must not hope for miracles. We biologically based creatures must solve our own problem s, including those we have created for ourselves. And we must do so by using the problem-solving tools we have: science-formation and commonsense understanding. Biologica l humanism lies in recognizing our limitations and using the cognitive tools we have. No tes 1 Steven Pinker in his 2002 account of human nature in The Blank Slate claimed that something like a Hobbesian picture of human nature is correct. He based his claim on a view of evolution and Darwinian selection of the sort that Chomsky claims to be inadequate for language, at least, and ar guably for other distinctively human characteristics. Pinker also proposed an ideal form of social or ganization for his view of human nature – essentially , a capitalist economy and a ‘liberal’ form of democracy – in ef fect, a version of a current form of Madisonian democracy . 2 As noted in earlier discussion, in some situations, attaining that ideal may be a particularly remote possibility . Humans are – or can be – more free and creative (and flexible) than other creatures. Y et a community defending itself against violent aggression in order to survive might have to restrict freedom. T o be justified, of course, the threat must be genuine and the need for restriction strong, unlike the trumped-up threat of attack from Iraq that Bush–Blair created and used as an excuse for unjustified and immoral policies and actions directed against both US residents and those in Iraq. 3 It is worth remarking that Rawls (1971) and other political thinkers such as Ronald Dworkin typically do not question the assumption that there will and even must be disparity in income and wealth in a society . Chomsky does. They rather employ various devices (in Rawls's case, an idealized form of social contract negotiation) to justify social or ganizations that maintain disparities. 4 Hobbes claimed to base his view on science. Since we still are far from constructing a good natural science of human nature, we should be skeptical. 5 Chomsky still maintains this position; see C&M: ch. 25. 6 There is considerable research indicating that people will deliberately harm others and in that sense dominate them in order to attain to or advance themselves in an authoritarian structure. For some discussion, see Milgram (1974). This fact probably plays a role in Chomsky's anarchism and rejection of authority , along with his resistance to ‘theory’ in the political domain, where ‘theory’ is typically directed towards aiding authority and control. 7 This kind of data is dif ficult to deal with. In the Gallup poll's compilation of answers during the twentieth century to their perennial question of whom people who were sampled most admire, the list went from Mother T eresa in 1st position to Mar garet Thatcher in 18th, with Billy Graham in 7th and Jackie Kennedy in 12th. Gandhi and Mandela made 13th and 14th, just ahead of Ronald Reagan. In 2006, Bush II was the most admired by men who were polled, Hillary Clinton by women. Lists like these must focus on well-known figures and the ways they are presented in the media. That inevitably distorts. 8 For some discussion of the universality of moral claims, see C&M: ch. 18. Glo ssary biolinguistics For Chomsky and others working within his approach, the current name for a nativist and internalist natural science research strategy for the study of language with special attention to issues of evolution and language development in the individual and species. compositionality Usually in the context “compo sitionality of semantics”: for Cho msky, a way of describing the combinatory principles that take semantic ‘inform ation’ contained in words (lexical items) and combine it into a complex form that might be called “the meaning of a sentence,” where this amounts to the inform ation that the language faculty provides to “other systems in the head.” I-language A speci fic indiv idual's language : for Chomsky , an I-language is a state of that person's language faculty at a specific time. “I” abbreviates “individual,” “in ternal,” and “intensional” (theory-specified). I-languages are the targets of theory; they are what linguistic theory should be able to describe and explain. See language. information In the context “meaning and sound information contained in lexical items,” it amounts to the cluster of “semantic features” and “phonological/phonetic” features lexical items contribute (along with compositional p rinciples) to ‘interfaces’ between language and other systems in the head. internalism A commitment to study a cognitive system independently of its relationships to things ‘outside the head’, whether items in the world or entities in an abstract domain. language For Chomsky , a system in the human head that allows for ways of combining the ‘information’ found in words (lexical items) to yield complex forms of sound and meaning information to two “interfaces” with other systems in the head. language faculty For Chomsky , a system or system in the head that is involved in the processing of “sentences.” Narrowly conceived, the language faculty is the “core” system that takes lexical items, combines them, and provides ‘information’ ( q.v.) at “sound” and “meaning” interfaces with oth er systems. Broadly conceived, the language faculty includes the other systems on the other side of the relevant interfaces. lexical item (LI) For Chomsky , a cluster of “features,” semantic (meaning- related), phono logical/phonetic (sound-related), and formal (derivation- related), that constitutes the ‘information’ contained in a word. Merge The current term for the combinatory principle(s) that combine words/lexical items and yield(s) sentences/expressions. It has at least two forms, Internal and External Mer ge. See the text. modularity The view that internal cognit ive systems can fruitfully (for purposes of successful theory-construction) be studied independently of other such systems. In some cases, a modular system can be thought of as a system that operates in accord with its own algorithms, rules, or principles. nativism A term often used by opponents of the biolinguistic study of language, in this book it is the n atural scientist's methodological assumption that a cognitive system or idea is somehow lodged in biology or another nature-based contribution to development/growth. parameter An option or group of options available to the developing language faculty that yield(s) one language as opposed to another . The “head p arameter,” for example, allows for “head-first” langua ges such as English or “head-final” languages such as Japanese. PHON One of two (per haps more) “interfaces” between language and o ther systems in the head. PHON is the “phonetic interface.” pragmatics The study of language – its exp ressions – conceived of as used by a speaker for some purpose or another . principle Until the 1980s , combinatory principles for language were called “rules.” Now they are called “principles.” The change came about, in part, because readers persistently misunderstood “rule” as “rule of usage.” SEM One of two (perhaps more) “interfaces” between language and other systems in the head. SEM is the “semantic interface.” semantics For many , the study of the relationship between language and the world, usually taken to be under stood in terms of truth and/or reference. For Chomsky , and particularly in the context of compositionality , the study of the semantic ‘information’ in lexical items and the combinatory principles that yield structured complexes of semantic information at a “meaning” (conceptual–intentional) interface. So conceived, semantics is a variety of syntax. sentence For mally speaking, theory-defi ned pairs of structured ‘sentential’ sound (or sign) and meaning ‘information’ provided at the language faculty's interfaces. Also known informally as “expressions.” syntax A term for the study of the intrinsic properties of words (lexical items), sentences, the combinatory operations of language, an d – broadly speaking – the study of anything in the head, conceived of from an internalist point of view . theory For some, any reasonably systematic account of a domain, even if it is the prospects of a hockey or football team. For Chomsky , a systematic account of a domain that meets the methodological standards of the natural scientist. third factor In recent work, Chomsky distinguishes three factors involved in the ways in which a child's language faculty develops or grows. One is a biological contribution, often called “UG” or “Universal Grammar” and traced to the genome. A second is ‘experience,’ or what might better be called the language-relevant ‘data’ that a child receives. The third, the “third factor ,” Chomsky (2005a: 6) describes in this way: 3. Principles not specific to the faculty of language. The third factor falls into several subtypes: (a) principles of data analysis that might be used in langua ge acquisition and other domains; (b) principles of structural architecture and developmental constraints that enter into canalization, or ganic form, and action over a wide range, including principles of efficient computation, which would be expected to be of partic ular significanc e for computational systems such as language. It is the second of these subcategories that shou ld be of particular significance in determining the nature of attainable languages. triggering A term emplo yed in developmental biology to speak of the contribution of ‘input’ of some sort to the development or activation of an innate system or ‘idea’ (lexical concept). It amounts to what Descartes and others in the seventeenth century called “occasioning.” For some discussion, see the section on innateness in the text. Universal Grammar (also UG) In current usage, the biological contribution to the development of a language faculty . word See lexical item. Most people – including many cognitive scientists – think of words as marks on a page, sounds issuing from people's mouths, or perhaps some form of binary coding.
