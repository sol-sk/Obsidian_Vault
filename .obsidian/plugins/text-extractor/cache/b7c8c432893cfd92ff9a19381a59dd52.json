It scares me to think that there might not be anyone out there for me 2. I feel it is close to being too late for me to find the love of my life 3. I feel anxious when I think about being single forever 4. I need to find a partner before I’m too old to have and raise children 5. If I end up alone in life, I will probably feel like there is something wrong with me 6. As I get older, it will get harder and harder to find someone 5 Reliability ▪ Test re-test reliability ▪ Inter-rater reliability ▪ Internal consistency reliability Class α = 0.81 Original α = 0.83 α ≥ 0.9 Excellent 0.7 ≤ α < 0.9 Good 0.6 ≤ α < 0.7 Acceptable 0.5 ≤ α < 0.6 Poor α ≤ 0.5 Unacceptab le 6 Construct validity Construct Validity Does content of measure reflect the meaning of the construct? Face validity Content validity How does this measure relate to other measures and behaviours? Predictive validity Concurrent validity Convergent validity Discriminant validity 7 Reliability and Validity Fear of Being Single Scale (Spielmann et al., 2013) 1.

What is in the middle of the data? ▪ Median = score that divides group in half ▫ 50% of the scores above, 50% below ▪ Mode = most frequently occurring score ▫ Sometimes no mode; sometimes more than one ▪ Mean = arithmetic average ▫ What we use! ▫ Uses information from every score 18 Measures of Central Tendency ▪ Calculate mean: ▫ Add up all scores in each group and divide by the number of scores in each group ▪ Median: ▫ Put scores in order ▫ Count number of scores ■ If odd #: identify the middlemost score. ■ If even#: identify two middle scores, take average of them ▪ Mode: ▫ Put scores in order, or create a frequency distribution. ▫ Identify the score that occurs most frequently 19202122 Mode ▪ Whenever you have outliers, making the mean inaccurate (not reflective of the actual sample) ▫ And a mode is readily observable 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 20000 30000 37000 50000 57000 100000 150000 450000Frequency Salary ($) Employee Salary Distribution Mdn Mode �𝑋𝑋 n = 25 23 Median ▪ Whenever you have outliers, making the mean inaccurate (not reflective of the actual sample) ▫ No mode is readily observable 0 1 2 3 4 5 20000 30000 40000 50000 1000000Frequency Salary ($) 24 Mean ▪ Most frequently-used measure of central tendency ( �𝑋𝑋) ▪ Con: ▫ Affected by outliers (i.e., extreme scores) ▪ Pros: ▫ With increasing sample size, each extreme score has less effect on the mean ▫ Maximises use of datapoints ▫ Has mathematical properties that allow us to do analyses 25 Mean, Sample size, Outliers 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 20000 30000 37000 50000 57000 100000 150000 450000Frequency Salary ($) Employee Salary Distribution �𝑋𝑋 26 Mean, Sample size, Outliers Sample Size 25 24 (drop the $450K) 240 (10x everyone minus $450K) 241 (10 x everyone plus 1 at $450K Mean 57 000 40 625 40 625 42 170 Median 30 000 25 000 25 000 30 000 Mode 20 000 20 000 20 000 20 000 The moral of the story: Check for outliers if you only have a small sample, but try to get a large sample as first step.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
