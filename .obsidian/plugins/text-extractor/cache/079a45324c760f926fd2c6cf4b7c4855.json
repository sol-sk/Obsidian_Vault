Brain cell basics 2 Learning objectives 1. Describe how we have used, and continue to use, metaphors to describe brain function. In what ways are these beneficial? In what ways are they limiting? 2. Name two theories of neuron function. Which one was shown to be predominantly correct? 3. Have a foundational understanding of basic brain facts. What aspect of the human brain is most clearly, mechanistically related to our intelligence? 4. Name and describe two general types of cells within the nervous system. 5. Identify three types of staining and the use case for each. 6. Name four types of glial cells and describe some functional roles for each. 7. Explain what is meant by a “tripartite synapse.” 8. Draw, label, and define the major features of a neuron. 9. Describe the central dogma of molecular biology. 10. Name and describe the function of some key cellular structures. 3 From “…the most efficient and capable foreman in their employ… a shrewd, sharp businessman, very energetic and persistent in executing all his plans of operation” To “He is fitful, irreverent, indulging at times in the grossest profanity…, impatient of restraint or advice when it conflicts with his desires…, devising many plans of future operations, which are no sooner arranged than they are abandoned… radically changed, so decidedly that his friends and acquaintances said he was ‘no longer Gage.’” Undoubtedly distorted tale, partial temporary effects, but still… History Phineas Gage: “Doctor, here is business for you.” 4 Antiquity • Guiding principle: metaphors • Schools of thought: doctors and philosophers • Prehistory • Egypt • Greeks Ø Hippocrates Ø Aristotle • Romans Ø Galen Ø Cerebrum & cerebellum Ø Ventricles, nerves Ø Humours History5 Renaissance to the 18th Century • Hydraulics: Vesalius, Descartes • Aside: materialism in science • Birth of white / grey matter anatomical maps, gyri and sulci History6 19th Century • Wires/electricity: Galvani & du Bois-Reymond • Dorsal/ventral: Bell & Magendie • Localization of function: Fluorens, Gall, Broca History7 O. Parker Jones et al. 2018 19th Century, continued • Evolution: Darwin, animal models • Cellular theory: Schwann History8 Golgi vs. Ramon y Cajal • Late 19th, early 20th c. • Golgi’s stain • Ramon y Cajal’s drawings • Golgi: reticular theory • Ramon y Cajal: neuron doctrine • Shared Nobel prize • Bitter rivals to the end • Ramon y Cajal vindicated • BUT Golgi not entirely wrong History9 20th century: SO MUCH • Really when modern neuroscience was born • What we’ll be studying here, mostly • 1990s onward: the brain as computer (problem?) History10 This one is from UBC! Courtesy of Dr. Kurt Haas Neuroscience: what it means to be you • Ostensibly the study of the nervous system • Very much the study of human nature • The goal: learn how the NS functions, and how it’s related to mind Talking science11 Levels of analysis • Molecular neuroscience • Cellular neuroscience • Systems neuroscience • Behavioural neuroscience • Cognitive neuroscience Talking science12 Human brain facts • 2-3% of body weight, ~3lbs • Consumes ~20% of your energy! • Slightly larger in men than women • Huge individual variation • Composed of neurons, glia, stem cells, blood vessels • <100 billion neurons (hard to say), more than half of which are cerebellum • Consistency of soft tofu (yum) • Convoluted (wrinkled) • Cells are not replaced Brain basics13 Adult neurogenesis or no? • A long history of controversy • First no, then yes, now no again? Sorrells et al. 2018 See Professor Jason Snyder’s excellent piece on this: http://snyderlab.com/2018/03/07/wtf-no-neurogenesis-in-humans/ See a great review on the state of neurogenesis in humans here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8967762/ 14 Brain basics Types of brains (not to scale) • Pattern? Brain basics15 1 2 3 4 5 6 Exceptions to the “rules” Brain basics16 It’s not the size that counts Brain basics Still doesn’t give us a mechanism, though 17 Brain Cell Density Brain basics • Intelligence also correlates with sophistication of cellular connections (i.e. wiring) 18 “Matter” • Gray Matter • White Matter Brain basics19 Nissl-stained (cresyl violet) gray matter of monkey Fiber stain of white matter: staining insulating glia cells Staining reveals “matter” Brain basics20 Cell basics • Neurons • Glia Two basic cell types 21 The neuron • Many types, but similar design • Dendrite à soma à axon à terminals input flow of signal output Cell basics22 The neuron • Many types, but similar design • Dendrite à soma à axon à terminals a. Pyramidal b. Stellate c. Purkinje Cell basics23 Two basic types of neurons • Projection neurons Cell basics • Interneurons 24 Two basic types of neurons Cell basics25 Glial Cells Cell basics Oligodendrocyte Microglia 26 Glial networks (astrocytes) Cell basics • Gap junctions • Reticular theory, revisited 27 The tripartite synapse Cell basics • A conversation of three • Glia have receptors, transmitters • Glia shape conditions at the synapse Pre-synaptic Post-synaptic Astrocyte 28 Ripped from the headlines • Glia play a key role in brain function, and we will hardly talk about them throughout this course 29 Cell basics Ripped from the headlines Cell basics • Glia play a key role in brain function, and yet we will hardly talk about them throughout this course 30 Cell basics The wonderful world of the cell 31 The central dogma of molecular biology: DNA à mRNA à Protein Cell basics32 What do proteins do? So much! Including being the basis for neuronal function Cell basics33 Soma: nucleus Cell basics34 What determines transcription? Cell basics Histone modificationTranscription factors 35 Soma (and elsewhere): ER and Golgi apparatus Cell basics36 Soma (and elsewhere): Mitochondria Cell basics • Engulfed bacteria? • mtDNA • Mitochondrial Eve? 37 The cell membrane Cell basics38 The cytoskeleton Cell basics Kinesin: anterograde transport Dynein: retrograde transport Alzheimer’s disease 39 The axon Cell basics Axon hillock Axon initial segment No ER Mostly no mitochondria Terminal bouton 40 The synapse • Site of neural communication Cell basics41 The synapse • The reality is often harder to understand than the diagrams Cell basics42 The dendrites Cell basics43","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
