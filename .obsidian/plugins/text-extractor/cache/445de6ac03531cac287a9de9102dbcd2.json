Null Hypothesis ▪ Mean 1 = Mean 2 ▪ H0 ▪ True effect: Study technique does not affect memory retention ▪ Differences between groups are most likely due to random chance Research Hypothesis ▪ Mean 1 ≠ Mean 2 ▪ H1 or HA ▪ True effect: Study technique affects memory retention ▪ Differences between groups are unlikely to be due to random chance 5 Directional vs. Non- directional Hypotheses Null Hypothesis ▪ Mean 1 ≤ Mean 2 ▪ H0 ▪ True effect: Repeated retrieval does not lead to better memory retention than solely studying ▪ Random chance likely caused Mean 1 > Mean 2 in our sample Research Hypothesis ▪ Mean 1 > Mean 2 ▪ H1 or HA ▪ True effect: Repeated retrieval leads to better memory retention than solely studying ▪ Random chance is a very unlikely explanation that Mean 1 > Mean 2 in our sample 678 Due to chance…? ▪ Key part of interpretation: ▫ Was the difference due to chance, or does it reflect a real difference in the population? ▪ Whether something is due to chance is always the most parsimonious alternative explanation for any research finding ▫ When analysing data, start by assuming that the null hypothesis is true ▫ Can we reject the null hypothesis? 9 Learning objectives ▪ By the end of this class, you’ll be able to ▫ Explain the relationship between a sample and a population ▫ Explain how a sampling distribution is made ▫ List the 3 steps in hypothesis testing ▫ Explain the logic of the numerator and the denominator in the t-ratio ▫ Differentiate between Type I and Type II errors 10 Large vs. small samples ▪ Small samples subject to more error in estimating population value ▪ Even with random assignment, problem still remains ▪ Random assignment works best with large sample sizes ▫ Chance plays major role in statistical analysis and research methods! Precursor for next session: When an effect does not exist in the population, but we conclude that there is an effect → Type 1 error 11 Statistically significance? Easy as 1- 2-3! 1. Calculate a statistic that captures the effect. • E.g., % (Chi square), mean difference (t or F value) , correlation (r)… 2. Refer to a sampling distribution for comparison ▫ For this sample size, what is an expected statistic value if there actually is NO effect going on. 3. Make a decision ▫ Is our statistic value sufficiently rare to consider it significant? ▫ If yes, reject the null hypothesis (LET’S PUBLISH!) ▫ If no, retain the null hypothesis (CRY IN A CORNER!) 12 Basics of sampling distribution ▪ Sampling distribution: ▫ Probability distribution of any statistic of interest assuming the null hypothesis is true (i.e. random chance) ▫ What it answers: What statistical result would you get from your data if your effects were only due to random chance? 13 Basics of sampling distribution ▪ My claim: While blindfolded, I have magical powers that no one else has, so more than half that I pick out will be purple Smarties in a sample of 10 Smarties ▪ What we need to know: How many purple Smarties would someone pull out at random in 10 Smarties? ▪ What we want: Sampling distribution for the number of purple Smarties in a sample of 10 Smarties 1. First: Get 1000 blindfolded students to take samples of 10 Smarties from a giant Smarties bag 2. Then: Determine how likely it is to pick out any number of purple Smarties by chance 14 Basics of sampling distribution ▪ Decide on what’s a rare # of purples as threshold = Critical value ▪ How does my performance compare to critical value? ▪ Similar to sampling distributions for other statistics Sampling distribution after N = 1000 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # of purple Smarties picked out in a 10-Smarties sample Critical value 15 Statistically significance? Easy as 1- 2-3! 1. Calculate a statistic that captures the effect. • E.g., % (Chi square), mean difference (t or F value) , correlation (r)… 2. Refer to a sampling distribution for comparison ▫ For this sample size, what is an expected statistic value if there actually is NO effect going on. 3. Make a decision ▫ Is our statistic value sufficiently rare to consider it significant? ▫ If yes, reject the null hypothesis (LET’S PUBLISH!) ▫ If no, retain the null hypothesis (CRY IN A CORNER!) 16 Get ready, because… 17 t-test ▪ A statistical technique: is difference between two means something to be expected from random chance … if the null hypothesis is true? ▪ If t obtained exceeds critical t value: suggests that the H0 might not be true 18 Determining if two means are significantly different from each other ▪ 1. Find “obtained t” value ▫ Use formula to convert the mean difference and standard deviation into a t value ▪ 2. Refer to sampling distribution of t values ▫ Find “critical t” value for that df and alpha ▫ From the table (Appendix C, Table C.2) ▫ Don’t need to find this for 217 ▪ 3. Make a decision ▫ Is our statistic value sufficiently rare to consider it significant? ▫ Is absolute value of |tobt| > |tcrit|? ■ If yes, reject the null hypothesis ■ If no, retain the null hypothesis 19 Inferential Statistics Overview ▪ Null & Research Hypotheses ▪ Sampling distribution ▪ t-test logic ▪ Statistically significant ▪ Type 1 and Type 2 errors ▪ Apply your understanding 20 Finding tobt 𝑡 = ത𝑋1 − ത𝑋2 𝑠1 2 𝑛1 + 𝑠2 2 𝑛2 Mean of Group 2 Mean of Group 1 Variance of Group 1 Variance of Group 2 Sample size of Group 1 Sample size of Group 2 21 Finding tobt 𝑡 = ത𝑋1 − ത𝑋2 𝑠1 2 𝑛1 + 𝑠2 2 𝑛2 Numerator: How big is the difference?
