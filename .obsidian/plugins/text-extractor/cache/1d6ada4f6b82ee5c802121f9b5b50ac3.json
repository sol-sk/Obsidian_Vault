Testing anti-anxiety Rx with 500mg, 1000mg, or placebo control • One IV with three levels 2 ANOVA: Factorial • “Factorial” ANOVA has multiple IVs (Ch. 16) – Factor 1: Dose (500mg, 1000mg, placebo) – Factor 2: Schedule (once per day, twice per day) • “Fully” factorial = all combinations 3 500mg 1000mg Placebo Once 500mg/once 1000mg/once Placebo/once Twice 250mg/twice 500mg/twice Placebo/twice DoseSchedule ANOVA: Assumptions 1. Sampled populations are normally distributed* 2. DV is interval or ratio* 3. Homogeneity of variance* – Like t-test, we will be averaging variance from different conditions *ANOVA is generally robust to violations assuming that N is relatively large and n’s are relatively equal 4 Example: Memory SPAN • Why not just multiple t-tests? – Need 3 tests – Each comes with α • Could we (α/3)? – Yes! But then we greatly increase β\tL 5 ID Digit span Letter span Word Span 1 8 6 4 2 10 10 4 3 7 6 4 4 5 5 2 5 9 7 5 6 10 4 4 7 9 5 5 8 6 8 4 !𝑿 8.000 6.375 4.000 Number of t-testsActual α Example: Memory SPAN • ANOVA has family wise α – We know α = α, & maximize power! • Limitation: ANOVA is always non-directional 6 ID Digit span Letter span Word Span 1 8 6 4 2 10 10 4 3 7 6 4 4 5 5 2 5 9 7 5 6 10 4 4 7 9 5 5 8 6 8 4 !𝑿 8.000 6.375 4.000 ANOVA: Hypotheses • H0: µ!\"#\"$% = µ&'$$'(% = µ)*(!% • H1: At least one mean differs • Conclusions are also non-directional: – “A one-way ANOVA revealed a significant difference in memory SPAN between the three stimulus types.” 7 ANOVA: Formula 𝐹!\"# = 𝑛 ( %𝑋$%&%#− %𝑋')( + ( %𝑋)*##*+− %𝑋')( + ( %𝑋,!+$− %𝑋')( /(𝑘 − 1) - (𝑆𝑆$%&%# + 𝑆𝑆)*##*+ + 𝑆𝑆,!+$) (𝑁 − 𝑘) Where $𝑋+ = Grand mean, n = participants per level, N = total participants k = number of groups 9 Homogeneity req.
