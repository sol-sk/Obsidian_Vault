The inner state is also linked to the idealized animal's senses. What kinds o f statistical relations will obtain among the action-steering inner state, the ani- mal's senses, and the world when the animal is wired up i n an opti- mal way? The behavior I am discussing is best performed when, and only when, the important external condition obtains. So i n a sense, the optimal inner state is one that is tokened when and only when the external state obtains. But I shall assume that this kind o f optimality is impossible fo r the animal, because it does not live i n an epistemi- cally benign world. Althoug h the important environmental state does have characteristic effects o n the animal's senses, it is possible for random \"noise\" i n the environment to produce some o f these sensory states as well. So, i f the inner state is thought o f as a belief about the state o f the world, it is not possible fo r the animal always to believe truly. The topic o f this paper is the animal's optimal wir- ing, where this optimality is understoo d as relative to a set o f constraints imposed by imperfect senses and an unfriendly envi- ronment.^ I suggested that the inner state could be thought o f as a belief about the world. This idea will have heuristic value at a number o f points i n the discussion, but it is not essential to the model. Some might prefer to think o f the inner state as a decision to act, others might refuse to interpret it i n this kind o f way at all. A s one o f the products o f this discussion will be an outline o f a naturalistic seman- tic theory, it is important that everything i n the model can be de- scribed nonintentionally. But there are other ways to put the model to philosophical work, and many o f these projects are more easily * This paper has benefitted from audiences at the University of Pennsylvania, UC Berkeley, the 1990 conference of the Australasian Philosophical Association, the University of Maryland, and Rijeka and Zadar (Yugoslavia).

I would also like to thank the University of Sydney for financial support. ^ For discussions of other aspects of the adaptive wiring of simple model ani- mals, see Valentino Braitenberg, Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology (Cambridge: MIT , 1984); and Paul Churchland, \"Cognitive Neurobiology: A Computational Hypothesis for Laminar Cortex,\" Biology and Philosophy, i , 1 (1985): 25-51. 0022-362X/91/8812/709-22 ©199 1 The Journal of Philosophy, Inc. 710 TH E JOURNA L O F PHILOSOPH Y presented i f the question about reducing semantic properties is ig- nored much o f the time. There are five schematic letters that must be introduced at this point. Fou r o f them refer to state types, and one to a variable. They are most easily remembered with the aid o f a diagram (figure 1). The important environmental condition is 5 (for \"signal\"). The other possible state o f the world is (for \"noise\"). X is a variable describing the animal's sensory input. C (for \"cause\") is the action- guiding inner state o f the animal, and M is the movement or behav- ior which C produces. In this discussion, I shall assume that the link between C and M is fixed: C always causes M , and nothing else does. I shall also assume certain fixed relations between input X and the two-world states S and N; these will be described shortly. The con- nection that can be tuned is the link between X and C ; the question is about which sensory events should cause C i n an optimally wired animal. The first outlines o f the answer are obvious. The animal wants to produce M when and only when 5 obtains, and M results when and only when C is tokened, so the link between C and the senses should be the one that maximizes the correlation between C and S. Because the animal labors under constraints, this correlation cannot be per- fect, but the animal should seek as good a correlation as it can manage. The idea that valuable or virtuous cognition consists i n a high degree o f correlation between thoughts and the states o f the world that the thoughts are about is familiar and well-explored i n recent philosophy. This is the central idea o f reliabilism i n epistemology.^ Th e appeal to reliable correlation has also spread fro m epistemology to the philosophy o f mind , and it has become popular to claim that the semantic properties o f internal representations depend, at least in part, o n some kind o f reliable correlation between thought and the world.^ Th e relevance o f mind/worl d correlatio n to various philosophical problem s is not the chief concern o f this paper. Rather, the aim is to develop a reasonably precise theory o f what a valuable mind/worl d correlation is. ^ See D . M. Armstrong, Belief, Truth, and Knowledge (New York: Cambridge, 1973); Alvin I.

SIGNAL, DECISION, ACTION 711 4 » ^ N Figure 1 The first essential point is that there are two distinct kinds or \"directions\" o f correlation to consider, and one o f these is far more prominent i n philosophical discussion than the other. Following Hartry Field,^ I shall call the currently favored direction o f correla- tion head-world reliability. A perfect degree o f head-world reliabil- ity exists when an inner state is tokened only i f a certain external condition obtains. It is not required that the inner state always be produced by the external condition. So C is sufficient, but perhaps not necessary, fo r S. The second direction o f correlation is simply the converse. A perfect degree o f world-head reliability obtains i f C is always tokened when S obtains, whether or not C obtains at other times as well. It is not hard to remember which direction is which, as Field's labels follow the direction o f a conditional with an arrow '->'. Extreme head-world reliability obtains when a state o f the head implies a state o f the world; strictly, it is head world rehability. The converse is world head rehability. It does confuse matters slightly when we leave the extreme case o f perfect correla- tion, and express the degree o f correlation as a conditional probabil- ity. The n a high degree o f head-world reliability is a high value o f Pr(S\\ C), and a high degree o f world-head reliability is a high value of Pr(C\\S). But many people find that thinking o f Field's labels as abbreviated expressions using an arrow is a useful mnemonic. It is a central contention o f this paper that head-world reliabihty has been wrongly elevated to a central position i n explanations o f virtuous cognition. This is explicit i n the work o f Dretske, Arm - strong, and Goldman. Dretske^ has built a detailed theory o f knowl- edge, perception, and belief content around a notion o f correlation * \" 'Narrow' Aspects of Intentionality and the Information-theoretic Approach to Content,\" in Information, Semantics and Epistemology, E. Villanueva, ed.

Armstrong's 1973 account o f knowledge and rational belief makes similar demands. I n Goldman's magnum opus, \"reliability\" is central to his account o f good cognition, and fo r Goldma n \"reliability\" is simply head-world reliability.® Goldma n also sometimes discusses \"power,\" which is admitted as another valuable property o f cognition, and one that must be traded of f against reliability. Power is a relative o f world- head reliability, but they are not the same thing. Althoug h this is not the place fo r detailed scholarship o n the matter, I think it is clear that these are not isolated cases, that head-world reUabiUty is central to many analytic and naturalistic conceptions o f good, responsible, duly cautious cognition.^ World-head reliability has had a little more attention i n the philo- sophy o f mind . Althoug h Dretske seeks to explain meaning with head-world reUabihty, the versions o f indicator semantics proposed by Stalnaker (op. cit.) and Fodo r (op. cit.) require both kinds o f correlation. Nozick (op. cit.) has a similar two-way position i n episte- mology. Althoug h this is a step i n the right direction, I shall argue, the accounts given by Fodor, Stalnaker, and Nozick neglect o r dis- tort the most important fact about the relations between the two kinds o f reliability; fo r they apparently require that thinkers simply brin g their thoughts into both kinds o f correlation with the world. But the critical fact here is the impossibility o f pursuing both kinds of reliability simultaneously. Except i n the most epistemically benign and friendly environments, the two kinds o f reliability cannot be bought as a package deal; rather, one must be traded of f against the other. This is seen readily i n extreme cases; one way to achieve excellent head-world reliability is to believe almost nothing, but this sacrifices almost all o f one's world-head reliability. World-head reli- ability can be pursue d by believin g everything that enters one's head, but this also leads to many false beliefs. The remainder o f this paper will present a quantitative theory o f the rehability trade off, and describe how to strike the balance optimally i n particular sit- uations. I. OPTIMALITY AN D RELIABILITY My discussion o f virtuous correlations between min d and world is based o n signal detection theory. Signal detection theory originated ^ See his Epistemology and Cognition, esp. chs 1-6. ^ The work of Isaac Levi is an important exception; see his Gambling with Truth (New York: Knopf, 1967). In a much longer work (in preparation) I discuss in detail the place of the two kinds of reliability in contemporary epistemology and philosophy of science. SIGNAL, DECISION, ACTION 713 in the 1950s, combining statistical decision theory with electrical engineering to give a general description o f both ideal and real signal-receiving devices. It has been used extensively i n psychophys- ics, and has more recently been discovered by foraging theory i n biology.^ I shall introduce the apparatus i n an anthropomorphic, biologically unrealistic way at first, and then show how a core direc- tive o f the theory can be mechanized. Suppose you are a carnivore, hunting i n long grass, and you see a movement i n one spot in this grass. This might be something edible creating the disturbance, or it might be just the wind. The decision problem is: Should you boun d aggressively to that spot or not? Assume first that your sensory input can be represented with a single variable X . A high value o f X corresponds to the input fro m a large disturbance o f the grass. The mathematics are simpler i f we assume that there is only a finite number o f values this variable can take. Yo u also know a functio n relating various values o f input X probabilistically to the presence o f prey (signal), and a correspond- ing functio n fo r noise. That is, you know how likely each value o f X is, given the presence o f prey, and you know how likely that same input is to occur when there is no prey there. So what you know can be represented as i n figure 2. Earlier I said that the model would apply to cases where the ani- mal is operating under constraints imposed by imperfect senses and an uncooperative environment. Figure 2 represents this fact in the overlap o f the two functions. Degrees o f input between 7 and 11, inclusive, can be produced by both signal and by noise. It is impor- tant not to read the value o f X in the middle o f the overlap (X = 9) as an input equally likely to have resulted fro m signal or noise; this depends o n the unconditional, or prior, probabilities o f signal and noise, as well as o n the information in figure 2. In this discussion, the prio r probability o f signal, Pr{S), will always be 0.2, so the prior for noise, Pr{N) will be 0.8.^ A central measure i n signal-detection theory is the likelihood ra- tio, \\{x), fo r an input. Let us avoid a profusio n o f subscripts in what ^ A standard reference is D. M . Green and J . A . Swets, Signal Detection and Human Observers (New York: Wiley, 1966).

Fo r these values o f X, which do not matter muc h i n this discussion, \\{x) will be set artificially at infinity. Wit h the informatio n i n figure 2, and the prio r probabilities fo r signal and noise, we can use Bayes's theorem to tell us what the probability is, given any input x, that there is prey i n the grass.

Muc h o f the algebra can be skipped, and rule (9) taken o n trust, i f preferred. Figure 2 and the prio r probabilities o f signal and noise tell you a lot about the likely states o f the world behind your inputs, but none of this informatio n tells us what you should do. T o decide what to do, you must take into account the various ways o f being right and being wrong, and their consequences. There are i n fact fou r possi- ble outcomes: (i) Yo u decide there is prey, and there is. This is called a hit. Yo u attack and get fed , and the value o f a hit, or V{H), here is 16 units, let us say. (ii) Yo u decide there is prey, but there is none. This is 3. false alarm.^^ You waste energy attacking, and maybe scare away other animals. The cost o f a false alarm V{FA) = — 2. (iii) Yo u decide there is no prey, and indeed there is not. This is a correct rejection. The value o f a correct rejection V{CR) = 0. (iv) Yo u decide there is no prey, but there is. Yo u miss out. This is called a miss. Yo u have not actually spent anything, so the value o f a miss here V(M) = 0. Some might think a miss should have a definite cost. I n fact it does not matter, fo r we are envisaging a limited number o f opportunities for hits, and a competitive process between different decision rules. Misses are then effectively penalized. These pay-offs can be repre- sented in a simple matrix. The Foraging Matrix S N yes V(H) = 16 V (FA) =-2 no V(M) = 0 V(CR) = 0 S = prey; N = no prey yes = attack; no = ignore The expected pay-off fro m deciding to attack will then be: (5) Exp(yes\\x) = V(H)Pr(S\\x) + V(FA)Pr(N\\x) and the expectation fro m deciding no: (6) Exp(no\\x) = V(CR)Pr(N\\x) + V(M)Pr(S\\x) From the standpoint of the theory of statistical testing, if noise is a \"null hypothesis,\" a false alarm is a type 1 error and a miss is a type 2 error. The relations between signal detection theory and other aspects of statistical theory are discussed in the longer work referred to in note 7. 716 TH E JOURNA L O F PHILOSOPH Y Assuming that you are interested i n simply maximizing your ex- pected pay-offs, case by case, you should say yes i f and only if: (7) V{H)Pr{S\\x) + V(FA)PriN\\x) > V{CR)Pr(N\\x) + C(M)Pr(S|x ) This rearranges to give: Pr{S\\x) ^ V(CR) - V(FA) Pr{N\\x)~ V(H)-V(M) Substituting (4) into (8) gives, with some rearranging: Pr{x\\S) ^ Pr(N) V(CR) - VjFA) ^ ^ Prix\\N) Pr(S) V{H) - V(M) The expression o n the left o f the inequahty we know as the likeli- hoo d ratio \\(x), and the expression o n the right is know n as ß. Within jS, the quantity V{CR) — V{FA) is the importance of noise. It combines the outcomes o f the different actions you might perfor m as a response to mere noise. The quantity V{H) — V{M) is the importance of signal; it combines the pay-offs fo r actions i n the presence o f signal. The quantities l(x), and, within ß, the impor- tance o f signal and noise, are the important parts o f signal detection theory fo r us, and (9) is the important formula. It directs that you say yes, attack, i f the likelihood ratio, calculated fro m the particular input you are now receiving and its relation to the probability func- tions fo r signal and noise, is greater than or equal to ß, which is determined by the prio r odds o f signal and the pay-off matrix. (Strictly, it does not matter what you do when l(:>c) = ß.) In this particular case: > 1/2 The value o f \\{x) beyond which you should say yes determines i n turn the critical value o f X, the intensity o f sensory input that yo u should consider sufficient to convince you to act. This is shown i n figure 3. The critical value o f X is labeled x,. Fo r any value o f X at or higher than x^, you should say yes. W e can see that i n this graph the ratio between Pr(X|5 ) and Pr(X | A^), where the value o f X is x^, is V2. A s the critical value ofl{x) delivered by formul a (9) increases, the cutoff x^ moves to the right, and it moves to the left as \\(x) decreases. We are now i n a position to answer the questions that began this paper. W e asked i f there is a general principle describing the opti- SIGNAL, DECISION, ACTION 717 1 7 . 11 17 X : Figure 3 mal way fo r an animal to have an action-guiding inner state wired to its senses i n order to achieve a desirable correlation between its thoughts and the world. Formula (9) is just such a principle. Given that M is caused by C , and the animal wants to produce M i f and only i f l(x) > ß, the optimal C is a state tokened i f and only i f l(x) > ß. So the animal i n figure 1 is optimal i f the link between X and C is such that C only fires i f l(x) > ß. Crucially, the optimal animal does not need to represent to itself any o f the algebra through which we have gone. It just has to have connected to M a state C that, as a matter o f physical contingency, fires when the animal's sensory input is such that \\{x) > ß. It does not know that these are the inputs such that \\{x) > ß\\ it just happens to be physically tuned to that set o f inputs. Two objections can be raised and answered at this point to clarify the proposal. First, how much depends on the assumption that X , the sensory input, varies i n one dimension only? Secondly, the opti- mal animal described above apparently does not really need C at all. The signal detection apparatus only describes the relations between S, X , and M . C is an epiphenomenal way station o n the road to M. These objections can be answered simultaneously. It is not essential that the input X be one-dimensional; it can be as multidimensional as you please. It can extend over time, and can combine the states o f a number o f sense modalities along with memory. Al l that matters is that it make sense to assign a likelihood ratio to each possible total input. It must be possible to compare the probability o f receiving that input as a consequence o f signal and as a consequence o f noise. Further, once we leave the idealized one-dimensional case, C does 718 TH E JOURNA L O F PHILOSOPH Y not look SO unimportant i n the architecture. C, the inner state, is then the place where the different components o f the input are combined. Although formul a (9) describes the optimal wiring between the senses, described by X , and the inner state C, it has not yet told us about the relations between C and S. W e have not been told how an optimal inner state is correlated with the world. But this is easy to calculate fro m the information we have, fo r formula (9) is a descrip- tion o f how best to strike a balance between the competing demands of head-world and world-head reliability. Once formula (9) has es- tablished a cutoff point o n the X axis, simple algrebra tells us the head-world and world-head reliability values that result. The fastest way to do the calculation is to note first that the world-head reliabil- ity o f C, Pr{C\\S) is simply the proportio n o f the area under the Pr{X\\S) function, to the right hand side o f x^. This area is the proba- bility that S will produce a value o f X that the animal will regard as sufficient to trigger C. In this case, Pr{C\\S) is about 0.972. Once we have this figure, the head-world probability falls out o f Bayes's theorem (formula (2) above, with C substituted fo r x). W e first work out the unconditional probability o f C , as the overall probability that a value o f X will be produced, by signal o r noise, which exceeds the cutoff x^. This is done by summing the value o f Pr(x I S)Pr{S) + Prix \\ N)PriN), fo r each value o f X over x, . Whe n this figure is divided into the product o f the world-head reliability and the prio r fo r signal, the head-world reliability is the result. In this case it is about 0.467. The animal has sacrificed head-world reliability i n order to obtain a very high value o f world-head reliabil- ity; it is tolerating a large number o f false alarms i n order to achieve as many hits as it can. Generally, the further the cutoff point is shifted to the left, the more head-world reliability is being sold of f i n favor o f world-head reliability. It is easy to see how this trade is driven by formul a (9). Whe n the cutoff x^ is shifted to the left, this is because a low value o f l(x) is being demanded by ß i n formul a (9). Ignoring perturbations in the prio r probability o f signal, a low value o f ß i n formul a (9) will be due to a large \"importance o f signal\" i n the denominator, com- pared to the \"importance o f noise\" i n the numerator. Perhaps hits are very valuable, false alarms are very cheap, misses are very expen- sive, or some combination o f these holds. O n the other hand, as false alarms become expensive, or the importance o f noise increases in other ways, the value o f l(x) demanded by formula (9) will rise. The n the cutoff x^ will be force d to the right, and head-world reli- SIGNAL, DECISION, ACTION 719 ability will increase at the expense o f world-head reliability. In sum, as the importance o f signal increases relative to noise, it becomes rational to trade head-world reliability fo r world-head reliability. A s the importance o f noise increases relative to signal, it becomes ratio- nal to trade world-head fo r head-world reliability. So far we have only considered an example involving foraging fo r food. By shifting our attention to other goals, other ways o f making the trade of f can be illustrated quantitatively. IL LOVE AN D DEATH The next case will be one i n which the basic for m o f the trade of f is the same, but fo r different reasons. This is the problem o f avoiding one's own predators. A pay-off matrix fo r interactions with preda- tors might be as follows. Predation Matrix S = predator in the vicinity; N = noise yes = flight or concealment response; no = no behavior Here the single most important case is the miss; i f you fail to detect a predator, you risk injury and death. Hits and false alarms cost —2 units alike. Correct rejections have no consequences. Leav- ing the prio r probabilities o f 5 and as they were i n the previous case, the value o f ß becomes 0.2 (see figure 4). In this case the average head-world reliability o f C drops to about 0.375. World-head reliability, o n the other hand, is force d all the way to 1. Because o f the cost o f a miss, the importance o f signal is so high in this case that every possible degree o f world-head reliability is purchased. Pr(X\\S) Figure 4 720 TH E JOURNA L O F PHILOSOPH Y Finally, we might look at a case where the situation is reversed, and head-world reliability should be sought. A suitably ecological case might be one's relations with the opposite sex. W e assume the animal is female, and in an environment where there are many males aroun d who are members o f different but closely related species to her. He r decision problem is the detection o f true conspecifics with which to mate. Her e is a matrix: The Mate Choice Matrix S N yes 40 -5 0 no 0 0 5 = conspecific male; = male o f another species yes = mate; no = don't mate In this situation both hits and false alarms are important. A hit results i n pregnancy that costs —50 units, but also i n offspring that is worth 90 units. A false alarm is getting pregnant to a male o f a different species. The result will be inviable o r infertile offspring, so the animal bears all the costs o f pregnancy with no reward. Correct rejections and misses have no consequences; there is no shortage o f males. The importance o f noise is higher than i n the previous exam- ples, though the importance o f signal is significant as well. Leaving the prio r probability o f signal at 0.2, the value o f /3 is 5 (see figure 5). Th e high value o f ß pushes to the right and, as a consequence, the head-world reliability o f C is now about 0.867. The animal has SIGNAL, DECISION, ACTION 721 paid fo r this with a world-head rehabihty o f 0.722. It is tolerating more misses i n its attempt to avoid false alarms.Onl y i n this last case does the optimal animal have the kind o f head-world reliability that many philosophers have prescribed fo r good cognition. If a loosely reliabilist perspective o n knowledge is assumed fo r a mo- ment, then only i n this last case might the optimal animal know that S obtains, when it tokens C. A s this is largely a consequence o f the pay-off matrix operating, a rough slogan suggests itself: the impor- tance o f knowledge is the importance o f noise. III. APPLICATIONS Philosophers have focused o n head-world rehability as an important raw ingredient in analyses o f justification, meaning, and related concepts. But signal detection theory puts head-world reliability i n its place, as a commodity to be sought ardently i n some situations, but to be traded of f i n favor o f world-head reliability i n others. There are many philosophical projects that might be overhauled i n the light o f this fact. In competition with the reliability-based approaches o f Dretske, Stalnaker, Fodor, and others, a number o f philosophers have re- cently proposed analyses o f the content o f mental representation which rely entirely o n the biological functions o f the representations and the devices that make use o f them.^^ A version o f this idea can be developed within the signal detection framework. Suppose that the history o f an animal's interactions with some state o f the world S has produced a state C , whose location in the animal's wiring is as close to optimal as could be managed i n the circumstances. That is, some selective force has led the animal to approximate the optimal trade of f between the two kinds o f reliability in the wiring o f C. I f C has been wired as a detector o f i n this way, it might have the function to represent S, and hence have S as its content. This is certainly too crude as it stands—we should have stopped expecting to hear four-hne theories o f meaning by now. But it suggests a way in which the teleological/functional view o f meaning can be made Interestingly, it has not paid that much in world-head reliability to generate this very high head-world value. This fact is also discussed in my longer treatment, along with other features of the signal detection theory apparatus that I have simplified or skipped in this exposition. See Ruth G. Millikan, Language, Thought and Other Biological Categories (Cambridge: MIT , 1984), and \"Biosemantics,\" this JOURNAL, LXXXVI, 6 (June 1989): 281-97; David Papineau, Reality and Representation (New York: Black- well, 1987); and Mohan Matthen, \"Biological Functions and Perceptual Con- tent,\" this JOURNAL, Lxxxv, 1 (January 1988): 5-27. 722 TH E JOURNA L O F PHILOSOPH Y more precise than it is presently, or perhaps a way to steer a middle course between reliabilist and teleological approaches. Dretske, i n his recent work, is already moving closer to such a middle course, and is held back only by a preoccupation with head-world relia- bility. Whether the explanation o f meaning can benefit fro m signal de- tection theory o r not, the theory has important consequences fo r the program o f naturalistic epistemology. Most immediately, the sig- nal detection perspective issues a challenge to those philosophers who claim special status fo r head-world reliability. This challenge has obvious similarities to pragmatist rebellions against orthodox epistemic values, sharing an emphasis o n action and the practical consequences o f cognition. Note, however, that while I assume a biological, behavior-linked determination o f the pay-off matrices i n this discussion, someone who assigned pay-offs o n the basis o f pure '^epistemic utility\" could make use o f the same forma l apparatus. Further, i n contrast to many central strands o f pragmatist thought, correspondence truth has a definite place i n the signal detection approach. For , i f C is regarded as representing S, hits and correct rejections are truths, while misses and false alarms are errors. So truth remains a definite goal o f cognition, though the truth-linked virtue o f reliability\" is taken apart and overhauled.
