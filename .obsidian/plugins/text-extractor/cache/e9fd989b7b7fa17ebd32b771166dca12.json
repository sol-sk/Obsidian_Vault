Nominal scale: Values are arbitrary – Also known as a “categorical variable” – Example: undergraduate major • Psychology = 1 • Engineering = 2 • Kinesiology = 3 – Nominal variables tell us only equivalence 12 Measurement scales • Variables are quantified for statistical analyses – Different measurement scales permit different statistical techniques 2. Ordinal scale: Values are ranked – But, interval between values may not be equal – Polling example: • 1st Sanders, 2nd Biden, 3rd Yang • We know that Sanders had more support than Biden, but we do not know how much more support – Ordinal variables convey rank but not magnitude 13 Measurement scales • Variables are quantified for statistical analyses – Different measurement scales permit different statistical techniques 3. Interval scale: Ranked w/equal intervals – Example: Day of the month • Today is the 7th, 14th will be exactly 168 hours from now, 21st will be 336 hours from now… • But there is no absolute zero point (no day ‘zero’) 14 Measurement scales • Variables are quantified for statistical analyses – Different measurement scales permit different statistical techniques 4. Ratio scale: Ranked, equal intervals, & zero – The value of 0 is possible and meaningful – Example: Reaction time • Zero means you responded simultaneously with the presentation of the stimulus • It took (literally) no time! 1516 Ratio Interval Ordinal NominalCount things that are alike Compare different things, put them in order Add & Subtract!!! Calculate Ratios Measurement ScalesWhat measurement scales? You want to know if dog weight is related to the speed of their eating. Weight is measured by Speed of eating is rated putting dogs on a scale: by observers as: Slow = 1 Medium = 2 Fast = 3 17 Discrete vs. Continuous • Discrete variables have no possible values between adjacent units on the scale – Example: Number of dogs (1 or 2, but NOT 1.5!!) • Continuous variables can have infinite possible values between adjacent units – Example: Weight of dog (1 gram, 2 g, or 1.5g) • Or 1.5000000000000001 grams 18 Real Limits of Continuous Variables • Continuous variables are always approximate – Estimates depend on our instrument’s resolution • Real limits are the values above and below the recorded value (by ½ the smallest measuring unit) – Measurement = 34.46lbs – Smallest measuring unit = .01lbs (half = .005lbs) – Real limits for this scale: • Real lower limit = 34.455 • Real upper limit = 34.465 19 Significant Figures “How many decimal places should I report?” – Means, standard deviation • Report 2 or 3 decimal places – Correlation/regression coefficients, test-statistics (like t, F, etc.) • Always report 3 decimal places – p-values (or ‘probability values’) • Always report 3 decimal places 20 Rounding Don’t worry about the text’s discussion of rounding (pp. 38) • Last digit equal to or greater than 5, round UP • Last digit less than 5, round DOWN 21","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
