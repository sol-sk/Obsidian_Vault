H0 is true H0 is not true Your Decision based on Sample Reject H0 Retain H0 Correct Decision 1 - β Correct Decision 1 - α Type 1 Error α Type 2 Error β 4 Type 1 and Type 2 error ▪ Power and Type 2 error rate (different sides of same coin) depend on 3 factors: ▫ Sample size ▫ Magnitude of effect (effect size) ▫ Alpha level 5 Type 1 and Type 2 error ▪ Sample size ▫ Greater the sample size, greater the power ▫ Less error in data to detect effect ▪ Magnitude of effect (effect size) ▫ The larger the difference is in the population, the easier it is to detect, thus greater power ▪ Alpha level ▫ The larger our alpha level, the easier it is to find data consistent with research hypothesis (reject null hypothesis), thus greater power 67 p hacking ▪ A set of ethically questionable research practises (QRPs) researcher use to get significant results ▫ Data peeking ▫ Creative data trimming ▫ Outcome-reporting bias ▫ Adding covariates ▫ HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) ▫ Spit in the face of science and ethics Based on: http://davidjjohnson.wordpress.com/2013/08/08/wired-suggests-p-hacking-as-a-cheat-code/ 8 Inferential Statistics Overview ▪ Null & Research Hypotheses ▪ Sampling distribution ▪ t-test logic ▪ Statistically significant ▪ Type 1 and Type 2 errors ▪ Apply your understanding 9 Learning objectives ▪ Explain the relationship between a sample and a population. ▪ Describe at least three errors in judgment people commonly make. ▪ Discuss the importance of relying on base rate data from large samples rather than small samples or single cases. ▪ Define the gambler’s fallacy. ▪ Generate a null hypothesis and a research hypothesis ▪ List the 3 steps in hypothesis testing. ▪ Explain how a sampling distribution is made ▪ Explain the logic of the numerator and denominator in the t-ratio. ▪ Explain the meaning of “statistically significant.” ▪ Compare an obtained statistic to a critical value and decide what to do with the null hypothesis. ▪ Explain when a researcher would use an F test rather than a t test to analyze data. ▪ Distinguish between Type I and Type II errors. ▪ Define alpha and power (in hypothesis testing context). ▪ Describe the relationship among effect size, power, Type I error rate, and Type II error rate ▪ Define and describe p hacking 10 Learning objectives ▪ By the end of today, you’ll be able to ▫ Describe the pros and cons of quantitative versus qualitative methods ▫ Compare and contrast quantitative and qualitative methods ▫ Define naturalistic observation, systematic observation, case studies, and archival research ▫ Recognise examples of each of the above methods ▫ Appreciate the important role that qualitative methods play in research 11 Goals of science ▪ Describe behaviour ▪ Predict behaviour ▪ Explain behaviour ▪ Determine causes of behaviour 12 Reign of quantitative research Quantitative methods ▪ Unit of analysis: Numerical data ▪ Method of analysis: Statistical analysis Qualitative methods ▪ Unit of analysis: Personal experience and open-ended responses ▪ Method of analysis: Interpretation of responses 13 Quantitative vs. Qualitative methods ▪ Quantitative methods ▫ Pros: ■ Excellent for testing hypotheses ■ Allow for effects and differences to be measurable and tangible ■ Allow us to determine if differences are likely to be due to chance – helps draw valid conclusions ▫ Cons: ■ Limits understanding of behaviours and thoughts to numerical representations of them ■ Validity of turning thoughts and behaviours into numbers? 14 Quantitative vs. Qualitative methods ▪ Qualitative methods ▫ Pros: ■ Excellent for generating and testing hypotheses ■ Allow for in-depth verbal understanding of human behaviour ■ Escapes issues related to distilling thoughts and behaviours into numbers ▫ Cons: ■ Conclusions drawn may be due to random chance or personal biases ■ Can be extremely time-consuming and difficult to interpret 15 Other methods… ▪ Naturalistic observation ▫ Obtain/gather/record information from people in the “field” ▫ Can sidestep ethically problematic experimental manipulations 16 Other methods… ▪ Participant observation ▫ The observer is participating along with the people being observed ▫ Purpose is made known to people in the group ▫ But reactivity!! Caption: Watch what I can make Pavlov do. As soon as I drool, he’ll smile and write in his little book. 17 Other methods… ▪ Concealed observation ▫ Either the observation itself is concealed, or the purpose of the observations is concealed ▫ Ethical considerations may be problematic 1819 Other methods…","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
