Range Range? 2. Standard Deviation s, σ, std, s.d. 3. Variance s2, σ2, var 3 Range • Range is the absolute difference between the most extreme scores – Data = Nutritional values from (N=77) cereals Density Histogram.

Remember !𝑋\t= 6.8 Σ(𝑋i – $𝑋) Deviations Problem: Summing or averaging deviation scores will give us 0 – Remember the mean is a fulcrum Solution: Square each deviation score – All negative deviations become positive – Then sum these squared deviations together for the sum of squared deviations (or SS) 8 SS = Σ(𝑋𝑖 – $𝑋)2 Standard Deviation • SS is the total sum of squared deviations – Dividing this by N gives us mean squared deviation (aka, variance) – Taking the square root gives us mean deviation or standard deviation – But, this needs a slight correction for bias (in samples)* 9 Σ(𝑋𝑖 – $𝑋)2 𝑁 s = . −\t1 Sample vs. Population s = σest = \t σ = σpop = 10 Σ(𝑋𝑖 – $𝑋)2 𝑁 − 1.
