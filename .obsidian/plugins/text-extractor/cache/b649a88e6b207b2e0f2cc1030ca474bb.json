T injections do not increase sex drives –(males have more than 10 times what they need)•Removing T effects (castration, drugs) eventually reduces sex drive (you need SOME T)–Replacement T brings sex drive back to normal levels7•Guinea Pig Experiment:•Rated “sexual activity” of males (ranked as Low, Medium and High Groups).•Castrated all males, then monitored sexual activity.•All males THEN receive same large dose of testosterone injections.•The (large) test dose of T restored all males to PREVIOUSlevel of sex drive. •Conclusion: OTHER FACTORS control individual differences in sex drive•SOME T is necessary, but more T does not mean more sex driveActivationalEffects of Hormones-Male Sex Behaviour (2)8Neural Regulation of Male Sex Behaviour (1)•Sufficient levels of T in bloodstream, “primes” certain brain regions to make them receptive to sexual stimuli•In males, T is converted to an estrogen in brain, and stimulates mPOA, medial amygdala When estrogens prime these cites, they can response to sexual stimuli•Olfactory signals go though medial amygdala, then to mPOA•mPOAsignals ventral midbrain motor centers spinal cord9Neural Regulation of Male Sex Behaviour (2)Evidence for Testosterone/Estradiol regulation of male sexual behavior1) mPOA/medial amygdala lesions disrupt sexual behaviour (but NOT sexual motivaton)2) mPOAstimulation initiates sexual behaviour3) in castrated males–administration of T (or estradiol) into just the mPOAreinstates sexual behaviour•Androgens gets these brain regions ready to act in response to sexual stimuli. Do not cause behaviour, but are necessary for it •Example of an activationaleffect of hormones on sexual behavior1123T310Hormonal Regulation of Female Sex Behaviour•In female rats, estradiol increases ~ 2 days before ovulation–One effect is that this causes brain to make progesterone receptors•Progesterone then starts to increase•When both peak, ovulation occurs: –at this point, female is fertile and shows sexually stereotyped behaviours•Both estrogensand progesteroneincreasing in this order is required for these events to occur.11Neural Regulation of Female Sex Behaviour (1)•The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) monitors changes in hormonal levels –Estradiol causes VMH neurons to alters dendrites and make progesterone receptors–Stimulation of progesterone receptors causes VMH cells to produce proteins necessary for lordosis•Hormones hitting their peaks activates multisynapticpathways that include motor areas. –Changes in VMH makes these downstream nuclei more excitable•Eventually, signals output through spinal cord, and promote lordosis in response to stimulation from mounting12Neural Regulation of Female Sex Behaviour (2)Evidence for estradiol regulation of female sexual behavior:1) VMH/PAG lesions disrupt lordosis2) implantation of estrogens into VMH reinstates lordosis in ovarectomizedfemales•This pathway is for particular motor program. Other sexual/maternal behavioursare mediated by other, more complicated brain circuits.•Again, hormones do not cause behaviour, but are necessary for it.13Hormones and HumanFemale Sex BehaviourEstrogens:•Human female sexual motivation/ behavior may or may not be as tightly linked to estrogensreleased during menstrual cycle.–HUMANfemales are different from most other mammals in this respect•Ovariectomydoes not have reliableeffects on sexual motivation/behavior. Androgens:•Testosterone levels can correlate with measures of sexual motivation.•Following ovariectomy, replacement injections of testosterone (not estradiol), rekindles sexual motivation. 14Menstrual Cycle and Female Sexual Behaviour •However…•Women DO SHOW some changes insexual behaviour patterns duringmenstrual cycle•Greater probability of having intercourseand achieving orgasm as ovulationapproaches•Other, more subtle changes inbehaviour also occur duringovulation….","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
