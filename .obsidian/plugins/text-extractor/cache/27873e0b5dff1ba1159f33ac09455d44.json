Che, Cuba, all of it…1960s Intro to the Graphic Novel & Inverna Lockpez Cuba: My revolution (Part 1) Friday, February 2, 2024 Reminiscences as the practical and theoretical foundation for the guerrilla rebel and the new man What is the collective purpose of the chapters from last week? What did they lay the foundation for? Guerrilla Rebel New Man The mountain The ideal space of formation of the guerrilla rebel… Suffering Collaboration Strategy The Vanguard A productive and “ignited” collective… guided by morale (ethical, heroic) and discipline (internal, external) The Socialist State Access to the means of protection and human necessity; capacity to inform, educate, and implement change Transitional Protectorate of the people The New Man The ideal human being that will continue to transform and adapt along with socialist society… The Foundation(s) of the New Man New Man We made history… We make society New Society New consciousness New system Socialism and Man in Cuba (1965) Written and Published in March, 1965 just one year after Che had left Cuba to “test out” his guerrilla warfare from Africa. Goal: Contextualize the Cuban Revolution as a model for other countries for the transition from Capitalism to Communism. The Theoretical Foundations of “Socialism and the New Man in Cuba”. Marxism [Karl Marx] Dialectical Materialism and Class antagonism: “The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles” (The Communist Manifesto 64). Revolution as the most radical expression of civil rights: “The communist revolution […] involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas” (87). Leninism [Vladimir Lenin] Marxism- Leninism Create the conditions necessary for Revolution now, don’t wait for them to be ripe… Socialism is a transition to Communism. Revolution as a two-stage process that involves the formation and recognition of the vanguard (catalyst for change), centralized “democracy,” and the dictatorship of the proletariat [Communism]. Capitalism Socialism Communism Associated with wealthy individuals (the bourgeoisie – the main oppressors of the working class)and the myth of the “self-made man” . A transitional social state between the Overthrow of Capitalism and the Realization of Communism. Protector of the Proletariat (working class) Class war leads to a (communist) society that isn’t based on private ownership of land or oppression of the proletariat The Historical Foundations of “Socialism and the New Man in Cuba” US Take-over Attempt Bay of Pigs (April 1961) The Castro Regime’s Response The October Crisis (1962) The Cold War turns “hot” during a couple of related events that Cuba collectively remembers as the Bahía de cochinos (1961-1962). Playa Girón: Main landing site for CIA operatives, trained to oust Fidel Castro in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. The Cuban Missile Crisis (US perspective): Cuba unites with then USSR to place nuclear missiles near Cuba to deter future invasions as a threat to US special ops forces, created to take Castro down. The result is a “peace” agreement between then U.S. president J.F.K. and Soviet Leader Nikita Khrushchev. July 26, 1953 January, 1959 Bibliography • Guevara, Ernesto ‘Che’.
