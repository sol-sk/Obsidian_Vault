What are some relationships between these variables? A B B A A BC 12The problem of interpreting causation from correlation Flossing Longevity General hygiene Bi-directionality Problem Third variable problem 13Example: Your neighbour’s 2-year-old child is diagnosed with autism MMR Vaccination Symptoms of autism Time 1 Time 2 Symptoms begin to be recognised by parents at around 18-24 months Subtle incremental developmental changes already start at 6 months 14 Moving beyond correlational studies ▪ Internal Validity: the ability to infer that one variable causes changes in another variable ▫ Covariation between two variables ▫ Temporal precedence ▫ Eliminate plausible alternative explanations ▪ Can difference in the outcome be attributed only to changes in some other variable? 15 Types of Studies Non- Experimental Designs Observation (later) Correlation Experimental Designs Between Subjects Within Subjects Quasi- Experimental Designs (later) 16 Key Features of Experiments ▪ Experimental designs allow for causality due to higher internal validity ▪ Achieving internal validity: ▫ Experimental Control ▫ Random Assignment of people to condition 17 Increasing internal validity: Control manipulated by researcher 18 Increasing internal validity: Control ▪ Experimental Control ▫ Only the IV changes across conditions ▫ Minimise “confounds” ▪ Confound ▫ A variable that co-varies along with the IV ▫ Could explain all or part of the result 19 An Example Experimental Design ▪ Hypothesis ▫ People who sleep longer the night before a test will perform better than those who sleep for less time. ▫ Variables… ▪ Amount of sleep ▫ ½ participants sleep 8 hours & wake up naturally ▫ ½ participants sleep 4 hours & wake up with alarm ▪ Test performance ▫ Everyone completes the same memory test ▫ Compare average score of the 2 groups 2021 Learning Objectives ▪ By the end of this/next class, you should be able to ▫ List and describe the two ways internal validity is attained in an independent groups design ▫ Understand the function of random assignment ▫ Describe specific ways that control is achieved in experiments ▫ Explain what experimenter expectancy effects and demand characteristics are and some ways a researcher can avoid them ▫ Differentiate between ceiling and floor effects. ▫ Explain what is meant by the strength of an IV and the sensitivity of a DV, and how they impact research design 22 Example Study Design ▪ Hypothesis: Playing violent video games make people more aggressive than playing non-violent video games ▪ IV: ▫ Non-violent condition: Play Tony Hawk Pro Skater for 30 mins ▫ Violent condition: Play GTA V for 30 mins ▪ DV: ▪ Prediction: Participants in violent condition will kill more ants than participants in non-violent condition Video game violence How many ants one kills 23Increasing internal validity: Random Assignment Non-Violent Condition  Violent Condition  Midterms! 24Increasing internal validity: Random Assignment No systematic reason for why participants are in certain conditions","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
