Spinal cord D. Major divisions of the brain E. The telencephalon: cortex and deeper structures F. Blood flow, skull, meninges, CSF 2 Learning objectives 1. Know the major divisions of the nervous system. What symptoms might you expect with damage at each particular division? 2. Know all the neuroanatomical directional terms and apply them when talking about brain structures. 3. Draw and label a cross section of the spinal cord. 4. List the descending sections of the spinal cord in order. Where would damage cause a greater loss of function, and why? 5. List and discuss the divisions of the human brain, both in 3 divisions and in 5 divisions. 6. Know brain structures within each of the myelencephalon, metencephalon, mesencephalon, diencephalon, and telencephalon. Coarsely, describe what damage to these areas might produce in terms of dysfunction. 7. Describe the location and function of the corpus callosum. 8. Know the major fissures. 9. Know the major components of the limbic system and basal ganglia. 10. Know the lobes of the cerebral cortex. 11. Know the anatomical features that protect the brain.3 The nervous system Central (CNS) (Well, the vertebrate nervous system) Peripheral (PNS) 4 Layout The nervous system Central (CNS) (Well, the vertebrate nervous system) Peripheral (PNS) Brain Spinal cord 5 Layout The nervous system Central (CNS) (Well, the vertebrate nervous system) Peripheral (PNS) Brain Spinal cord Somatic (SNS) Autonomic (ANS) 6 Layout The nervous system Central (CNS) (Well, the vertebrate nervous system) Peripheral (PNS) Brain Spinal cord Somatic (SNS) Autonomic (ANS) Efferent (motor) Afferent (sensory) SNS: external environment, (mostly) conscious 7 Layout The nervous system Central (CNS) (Well, the vertebrate nervous system) Peripheral (PNS) Brain Spinal cord Somatic (SNS) Autonomic (ANS) EfferentAfferent Efferent (motor) Afferent (sensory) ANS: internal environment, (mostly) non-conscious 8 Layout The nervous system Central (CNS) (Well, the vertebrate nervous system) Peripheral (PNS) Brain Spinal cord Somatic (SNS) Autonomic (ANS) EfferentAfferent EfferentAfferent Parasympathetic NSSympathetic NS 9 Layout ANS efferents Sympathetic: mobilize energy Parasympathetic: conserve energy Not always mutually exclusive / in opposition to one another 10 Layout ANS effects aren’t always generalized across the body?!? Work from Dr. Rebecca Todd’s lab in the Department of Psychology at UBC! 11 Layout Kryklywy et al. 2022 Clusters and bundles Cell clusters: Nucleus/nuclei (CNS) vs. ganglion/ganglia (PNS) (except when the old anatomists screw it up) Bundle of axons: Tract (CNS) vs. nerve (PNS) vs. fibres (all) 12 Terminology Anatomical dimensions Critical for describing brain regions! 13 Terminology dorsal ventral The neuraxis Note that we (a bipedal species) have a weird neuraxis Ant. Post. Ant. Post. Anatomical dimensions Sections/cuts 14 Terminology Spinal cord Intermittent projections from spinal cord – why? Narrows/tapers when from cervical to coccygeal – why? Ends in cauda equina Grey/white matter divisions (Grey is inner “H”) Dorsal/ventral organization Spinal cord damage: loss of function related to segment of damage! 15 Spinal cord Major divisions of the brain (3) Appear early in development Termed the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain 18-21-day-old embryo Midbrain Hindbrain Forebrain 16 Divisions Major divisions of the brain (3) We have disproportionately large forebrains as compared to, say, fish 17 Divisions Major divisions of the brain (5) Arguably more useful than three-division map 18 Divisions Our roadmap A structural MRI What kind of section? 19 Divisions Myelencephalon (aka the medulla) Or medulla oblongata (go wild) Lots of tracts Involuntary control of life-sustaining functions Doctors reluctant to perform surgery here Insults here are often fatal 20 Divisions The reticular formation aka The reticular activating system ~100 nuclei Runs from myelencephalon to mesencephalon Critical for arousal, wakefulness, attention, sleep Damage to this region causes major disruptions to life, and/or can be fatal 21 Divisions Metencephalon Again, lots of tracts Comprised of multiple regions 22 Divisions Metencephalon Also houses reticular formation 23 Divisions Metencephalon The pons: large white-matter bulge, continuing from spinal cord/medulla Damage to this region? 24 Divisions Metencephalon The cerebellum: 10% of brain volume, >50% of neurons Critical for motor coordination, more Damage to this region? 25 Divisions Mesencephalon aka The midbrain Comprised of a roof (tectum) and a floor (tegmentum) 26 Divisions Mesencephalon Tectum: Comprised of two pairs of bumps (colliculi) aka The Boston Pizza Part of Your Brain Superior colliculi: vision with respect to eye movement Inferior colliculi: audition with respect to head/body orientation Outside of conscious access Damage to these regions? (e.g. Parinaud’s syndrome) 27 Divisions Mesencephalon Tegmentum: Contains top of reticular formation More fibres Periacqueductal grey Dopamine-producing regions Substantia nigra Ventral tegmental area (VTA) Red nucleus Pattern of function for these? Damage to these? 28 Divisions Diencephalon Comprised of two structures: The thalamus and hypothalamus 29 Divisions Diencephalon Thalamus: Many nuclei: inputs from sensory systems, cerebellum, basal ganglia Often called a “relay centre” for sensory information True, but: receives almost as much from cortex as it sends to cortex And so many other inputs Corticothalamic loops? Damage to this region? 30 Divisions Diencephalon Hypothalamus: Many nuclei Key intersection with endocrine system via the pituitary gland Diverse functions: sex, aggression, feeding, sleep/wake, more Damage to this region? 31 Divisions Telencephalon The largest division of the human brain Not just the cortex, but also the underlying structures Damage here is wide-ranging in its symptoms, and is much of what we’ll be discussing in this course 32 Divisions Telencephalon The cerebral cortex: aka The cortex, neocortex The largest and most prominent feature of the human brain 33 Telencephalon Telencephalon The cerebral cortex: aka The cortex, neocortex The largest and most prominent feature of the human brain The cortex is highly convoluted — why? cf. The lissencephalic (smooth) cortices of other mammals, birds, etc. 34 Telencephalon Convolutions Gyrus/gyri and sulcus/sulci Sulci sometimes called fissures Not functionally meaningful, per se 35 Telencephalon Hemispheres The cerebrum is divided into two hemispheres Separating the hemispheres: The longitudinal fissure Contralateral organization 36 Telencephalon Connecting the hemispheres Left and right hemispheres are only connected by a few tracts (commissures) Largest: the corpus callosum 37 Telencephalon More fissures, and lobes Four lobes of the brain — where do they get their names? Central fissure separates frontal and parietal lobes Lateral fissure separates temporal lobe from frontal/parietal Deep in the lateral fissure: the insula 38 Telencephalon The limbic “system”: not a system The Papez “Circuit”, aka the Limbic “System” à Amygdala, HTh, mammillary body, hippocampus, fornix, cingulate cortex, septum, olfactory bulb Again, symptoms from damage can vary from region to region (we’ll come back to these) 39 Telencephalon Basal ganglia Includes striatum (caudate + putamen) and globus pallidus, sometimes others (e.g. subthalamic nucleus) Nucleus accumbens is a subregion of striatum/caudate, sometimes called ventral striatum Critical in movement, skills, habits, decision making Again, more on this later 40 Telencephalon Anatomy of the cortical layers Different neurons at different layers Input layers, output layers Different parts of the cortex look different – why? 41 Telencephalon Anatomy of the cortical layers These differences between parts of the cortex can be used to make maps e.g. Brodmann areas 42 Telencephalon Do we only use 5%/10%/etc. of our brains? No. 43 Telencephalon e.g. Controlling voluntary movement Prefrontal cortex Premotor areas Motor cortex Basal ganglia Pons Cerebellum More 44 Telencephalon Cerebral blood flow Limited supply No reserves No redundancy Implications for brain dysfunction? 45 Support Cerebral blood flow Limited supply No redundancy No reserves 46 Support The blood-brain barrier (BBB) Tightly packed Protects brain Active transport for large molecules W po on 47 Support Skull and meninges Primarily protection for the brain 48 Support Skull and meninges Primarily protection for the brain 49 Support Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and ventricles Support, protection, nutrition 50 Support Summary of brain structures It’s a lot, but you can do it! 51 Support","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
