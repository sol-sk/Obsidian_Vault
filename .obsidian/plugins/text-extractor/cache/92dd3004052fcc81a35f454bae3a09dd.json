(Wrong answers OK) • Also a great space to talk about interesting science/tangents, or to find fellow students to study with • Be good to one another, please Course design12 Psychology • “Psyche” à mind • “-ology” à the study of • Psychology sounds like “the study of the mind” • But in many key respects, psychology is the study of human behaviour PSYC304 Neuroscience Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system. from: http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/10/01/investments-in-science-lead-to-bubble-behaviour/ PSYC30414 Neuroscience Neuroscience has many subdisciplines, one of which is behavioural neuroscience, the study of the relationship between brain and behaviour. And behavioural neuroscience itself has a number of subdisciplines. It relies on both human and non-human animal work. PSYC304 Hosking et al. 201515 PSYC304 This course is about the fundamentals of neuroscience and how they relate to our behaviour and mind. Note: this is an Arts course designed to teach you neuroscience from first principles. This is a two-semester course! The incredible Dr. Stan Floresco teaches the second half. In our first semester together, we will cover: • The brain • Research principles • The neuron • Neural communication • Neuroscience research methods & tools • The endocrine system • Sensation and perception • Motor control PSYC30416 PSYC304 This course is about the fundamentals of neuroscience and how they relate to our behaviour and mind. Note: this is an Arts course designed to teach you neuroscience from first principles. In the second semester, with Dr. Floresco, you will (probably) cover: • Addiction and motivation • Hunger and eating • Emotions and stress • Learning and memory • Sleep • Attention and consciousness • Psychopathology PSYC30417 The role of research in neuroscience • Research is a fundamental part of neuroscience • Neuroscience addresses a diverse range of questions, e.g., – What does depression look like in terms of brain structure/function? – How does the brain recognize faces? – How do we make decisions? Why do our similar brains make different choices? • Different research methods are needed to address different neuroscientific questions PSYC30418 Resources Website: canvas.ubc.ca Slides, extra readings, grades, announcements Reading materials: Behavioral Neuroscience 10e by Breedlove and Watson *most recent older edition is likely sufficient 1st semester: The textbook is recommended, not required 2nd semester: The textbook is required Additional reading materials may be provided via Canvas; these will be clearly marked as supplemental or required Admin & policies19 Evaluation for term 1 Syllabus quiz: 2% Exam 1: 16% Exam 2: 16% Exam 3: 16% ____ Total: 50% Bonus research participation: 3%* *You can only get 3% maximum across the entire year Admin & policies20 Midterm Exam 1 (16%): Tues, Oct 10th 9:30-10:45am Midterm Exam 2 (16%): Thurs, Nov 9th 9:30-10:45am “Final Exam” (16%): Dec 11th-22nd (date/time TBD) You must be available to write at any time during this period.
