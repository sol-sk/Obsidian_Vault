Dar-Nimrod, Cheung, Ruby, & Heine (2014) Study 1: Relationship between belief about explanation for obesity, and beliefs about weight control Study 2: Manipulating explanation for metabolism affects people’s beliefs about weight control Study 3: Manipulating explanation for obesity affects how much one eats in a study 4 Beyond single studies ▪ Replications can take multiple forms Direct replication Replication-plus-extensionConceptual replication 5 Beyond single studies ▪ Conceptual replications ▫ Key question: ■ What was original study trying to examine? ▫ New study: ■ New design and/or materials that are conceptually similar to original study Study 1: Playing violent video games, then measuring one’s likelihood of getting into a fight Study 2: Playing different violent video games, then measuring how many violent thoughts someone has 6 Beyond single studies ▪ Direct replications ▫ Key question: ■ Was the original finding real, or was it by chance? ▫ New study: ■ Exactly copying methodologies and materials as original study ▫ Compensates for problems with conceptual replications 7 Beyond single studies ▪ Replication-plus-extension ▫ Key question: ■ Was the original finding real, and what else can I do with it? ▫ New study: ■ Partially uses the same materials as the original, but adds additional parts to address additional questions Study 1: Manipulate explanation for criminality affects perceptions of criminal Study 2: Manipulate explanation criminality affects perceptions of criminal and attributions people make for crimes Cheung & Heine, 2016 8 Beyond single studies ▪ Meta-analysis ▫ Allows researchers to get a better understanding of what the actual effect might be Problem? 9 Beyond single studies ▪ Publishing null studies Some study: Result 1: Significant Result 2: Non-significant Result 3: Significant 10 New Directions ▪ Remember? Marc Hauser Diederik Stapel Lawrence Sanna Dirk Smeesters 11 New Direction ▪ “Replication crisis” in psychology ▫ Many results from psychological studies cannot be replicated by either original researchers or other researchers ■ Due to Questionable Research Practices (QRPs)/p-hacking 12 Questionable studies? ▪ Daryl Bem – Evidence for extrasensory perception 13 Questionable studies? ▪ Lady Macbeth Effect 14 New Directions ▪ Open Science ▫ Movement to allow data and research to be accessible to everyone ▫ Encourages transparency, community, and collaboration ▫ Allows for better scrutiny and quality assessment of research 15 New Directions ▪ Open Science - Preprints ▫ Unpublished work published online (or print that is pre-publication) ▫ No pay-wall, publically accessible ▫ Drawback: Not peer-reviewed 16 New Directions ▪ Open Science ▫ Psychological Science’s Open Badges Open data Open materials Pre-registration Authors provide data for anyone to access and analyze Authors provide study materials for anyone to access and check/replicate Authors registered hypotheses and analysis plan before running the study 17 New Directions ▪ Open Science ▫ Open Science Foundation’s Registered Replication Reports (RRRs) ■ Write proposal to register hypothesis ■ Register materials and plan of analysis ■ Upload data and all analyses ■ Write report to address reproducibility of registered hypothesis","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
