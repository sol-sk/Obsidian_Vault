often, they don’t reach goal at allDinner Party Problem”: subjects given “real-world” planning task•Given 6 errands to run (e.g.: buy loaf of bread, etc)•Also told to get answers to 4 questions (e.g.; price of tomatoes).•Explicitly told notto enter shops unnecessarily finish as quick as possible•PFC damaged patients very inefficient: broke rules (entered unnecessary shops) and failed on many tasks•All patients remembered and understood rules and attempted to comply•NOT a memory deficit, but a deficit in integrating memory to form plan of action3Psychopathology (Ch.16) •Schizophrenia–Symptoms, Epidemiological factors–Causes•Genetic, Neurodevelopmental–Cognitive and Brain Abnormalities4Schizophrenia: What is it? •Described originally by Kraepleinasdementia praecox (early dementia), and later by Bleuleras schizophrenia (split mind)•Best viewed as a family of disorders, characterized by at least a few distinct symptoms•Positive Symptoms: abnormal behaviours that have been gained–Hallucinations (typically auditory), Delusions (paranoia), thought disorder = PSYCHOSIS•Negative Symptoms: normal functions that have been lost–Blunted emotional responses, poverty of speech, social withdrawal, anhedonia, Lack of insight, COGNITIVE DEFICITS5Diversity of Symptoms in Schizophrenia•At least (1) of (3) core symptoms is required for diagnosis (DSM-5) –although presentation vary greatlyHallucinations, delusionsor disorganized speech•These symptoms also present in other conditions that need to be ruled out before schizophrenia is diagnosed–Lack of insight into illness 97%Auditory hallucinations 74%–Delusions of reference 70% Verbal hallucinations 70%–Suspiciousness65%Flatness of affect 65%–Paranoid state 64%•~ 1% of population suffer from schizophrenia at any given time–Onset is typically after puberty (18 yrs). –Typically does not onset after 30 in men, small number of women develop symptoms after menopause (+45 yrs)6Cognitive Abnormalities in Schizophrenia(I)•Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are less dramatic than psychotic symptoms: however, these deficits may be a core component of the disorder (i.e.: dementia praecox)–Cognitive functioning is the #1 predictor of long term outcome (better function = better prognosis)–Severity of psychotic symptoms not related to severity of cognitive deficits–Many of the functions impaired in schizophrenia are mediated by the prefrontal cortex and/or hippocampus7•Brain activation studies:schizophrenia patients and discordant identical twin controls performed Wisconsin Card Sort •Schizophrenia patients showed minimal increase in PFC activity when performing task, unlike controls•Other brain regions were activated similarly in both groups•Schizophrenia is associated w/ disruption in PFC function, but not as much for other cortical regionsCognitive Abnormalities in Schizophrenia(II)8Genetics of Schizophrenia•Odds of developing disorder increases if one has a relative diagnosed with schizophrenia─Highest concordance in identical twins, or if both parents have schizophrenia (~50%)•Adoption studies also indicate that there is a heritability component.These findings indicate:1) there is a strong genetic component to schizophrenia, but2) altered genes are NOT the only cause of the disease•Genetic component not linked to just one gene, there are likely dozens that may be altered.ONEParent9Neural Developmental and Schizophrenia•Alterations during development are thought to be major contributing factor to the disorder•In uteroinfluences include:–Poor nutrition during pregnancy–Premature birth/low birth weight–Physical/immune stressors during pregnancy5055606512345678910Months after start of flu epidemic Average numerof schizophrenia births•Early developmental insults lead to brain abnormalities in adulthood•Stressors later in life (after puberty) can trigger onset•Genetics sensitivity to stressors by mother or child, either in uteroor later in lifeSome people may have a genetic susceptibility to acquiring the disease, but certain types of stressors needed to trigger itNeural Abnormalities in Schizophrenia(I)•Not brain damage per se: changes in neural organization (occurring during development) can disrupt how brain regions process information•Hippocampus: Some individuals w/ schizophrenia have enlarged lateral ventricles, due to smaller hippocampus and other temporal lobe regions•Closer inspection reveals altered organization of hippocampal neurons in brains of those w/schizophrenia10Neural Abnormalities in Schizophrenia(II)•Prefrontal Cortex pyramidal neurons have reduced #of dendrites; reduces processing power of these cells.•Hypofrontality(reduced PFC function) is a characteristic negative symptom of schizophrenia GABA interneuronGABA interneuron•GABAergicinterneurons: serve as a major information filter for PFC (and other regions like hippocampus) •Schizophrenics have reduced GABAergicinterneurons in these regions•This may lead to a “noisy” cortex, reducing information filtering and impairing functioning of these regions1112The Dopamine Hypothesis of SchizophreniaStriatumMidbrain dopamine neuronsPFC•Most of the dopamine in the brain is produced in small nuclei in the midbrain•1950s:Chlorpromazine found to be antipsychotic; causes Parkinson’s symptoms in healthy individuals•Brains of Parkinson’s patients found to be depleted of dopamine•1960s: Drugs that increase dopamine release (e.g.; amphetamine) could induce psychotic symptoms•Chlorpromazine, other antipsychotics found to block dopamine receptors•1970s: Dopamine receptor subtypes discovered; antipsychotic potency of a drug correlated with binding to D2 receptors (not D1)•THUS, The dopamine hypothesis was born:•Schizophrenia is caused by an abnormal increase in dopamine transmission, leading to overstimulation of D2 receptors13Support for the Dopamine Hypothesis•ALLdrugs are effective in treating psychosisblock D2 receptors to some degree–How are D2 receptors being overstimulated?More D2 receptors?–Unlikely: Some post mortem studies report D2 receptors in schizophrenia brains, others failed to find this effect–Changes may be due to chronic antipsychotic medication upregulatingdopamine receptorsMore dopamine being released?–Study:imaging allows for non-invasive measure of dopamine release in human brain–Give amphetamine to those with schizophrenia or controls–Greater dopamine release in striatum in those w/ schizophrenia–More dopamine release correlated with more positive symptoms induced by amphetamineDopamine release•Dopamine release may be hypersensitive in schizophrenia 14•DA neurons show increased activity to highly salient/novel stimuli—This increase in activity (and dopamine release in striatum) may serve as a signal the brain uses to determine what’s important or relevant•A hyperactive DA system may “tag” normally irrelevant stimuli as important, and impair filtering out of irrelevant stimuliWhat is Dopamine Doing in Schizophrenia?Striatum•This leads to “aberrant salience attribution” that may contribute to delusions —Eg: instead of disregarding them, you start thinking they out to get YOU and working for the CIA, who are controlled by aliens etc…•Antipsychotic medications are thought to reduce this aberrant salience by reducing DA activity•Note:often, people w/schizophrenia still report hearing the “voices” when they’re on medication, but they are no longer bothered by themWhy are they looking at ME?They must be after me!Midbrain dopamine neurons","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
