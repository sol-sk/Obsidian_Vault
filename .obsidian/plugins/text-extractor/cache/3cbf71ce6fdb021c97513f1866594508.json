Generate hypotheses – Directional or non-directional? 2. Set alpha level 3. Calculate standard error of the mean 4. Calculate zobt 5. Compare p vs. α 6. Reject H0 or fail to reject H0 21 5. Compare zobt to zcrit Statisticians suck… • α – Error rate when rejecting H0 (Type I error) – Y-intercept in regression formula • β – Type II error rate – Standardized slope coefficient • When to reject H0… – If p is smaller than α – If zobt is larger than zcrit • p is inversely related to test statistics – As p gets smaller, z gets larger – As p gets smaller, t/F/χ! gets larger 22 Are profs hoarding books? Normal Deviates Test • In the population, people buy an average of 14.00 books (w/standard deviation of 5) • You sample from 24 Psych Profs and find an average of 16.20 books Step 1: – H0: No difference between psych profs & population – H1: There is a difference between psych profs & population Step 2: α = .05 23 Steps to using z-test 1.

Normal Deviates Test 28 Were the coins ‘rigged’? • Coin flips were used to decide the allocation of 6 delegates in Iowa (2016) • If we’re testing whether these coin flips were somehow rigged, what are our hypotheses? • How can we test these hypotheses? – What is our expectation given H0? – One-tail test or two-tail test? – What level of Type I error should we accept? 2930 • Population IQ scores have µ = 100, σ = 15 • You sample from 10 classmates and find !𝑋 = 107 – Are your classmates reliably different from the pop.

To test this, Andrew measured how long (in ms) it took each of the dogs to sit after Andrew said the command. These data are below: (5 points) Let’s perform the Sign Test to analyze these data a) First, define H0 and H1 39 Puppy Hippo Piglet Taco Chance Spot Spruce Baseline 540 350 1204 300 1280 690 After film 400 338 1035 285 1600 810 Practice Item Professor Andrew is interested in testing whether puppy training classes have affected the sitting behavior of dogs in the class. To test this, Andrew measured how long (in ms) it took each of the dogs to sit after Andrew said the command. These data are below: (5 points) b) Second, let’s set the alpha level. Andrew wants to give the benefit of the doubt to the puppy training classes. In other words, Andrew wants to reduce the possibility of making a Type II error. Circle the value of alpha below that would best correspond with this: .005 .01 .05 .10 40 Puppy Hippo Piglet Taco Chance Spot Spruce Baseline 540 350 1204 300 1280 690 After film 400 338 1035 285 1600 810 Practice Item Professor Andrew is interested in testing whether puppy training classes have affected the sitting behavior of dogs in the class.

These data are below: (5 points) c) Now that we have chosen the alpha level, determine how many dogs would need to improve in order to reject H0.
