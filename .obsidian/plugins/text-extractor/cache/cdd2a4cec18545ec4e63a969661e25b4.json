The dead salmon study • fMRI: functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging • detects changes in bloodﬂow in diﬀerent brain areas • changes in blood ﬂow ~ changes in neural activation patterns Brains! The dead salmon study • a dead salmon shown images of humans “in social situations with a speciﬁed emotional valence” (Bennett et al. 2010, p. 2) • salmon asked “which emotion the individual in the photo must have been experiencing” (Bennett et al. 2010, p. 2) • red areas: signiﬁcant change in activation during photo display compared to rest The dead salmon study • a dead salmon shown images of humans “in social situations with a speciﬁed emotional valence” (Bennett et al. 2010, p. 2) • salmon asked “which emotion the individual in the photo must have been experiencing” (Bennett et al. 2010, p. 2) • red areas: signiﬁcant change in activation during photo display compared to rest noise 1 noise 2 “signiﬁcant changes” The dead salmon study many diﬀerent brain areas tested at the same time • tens of thousands of hypotheses • the proportion of true hypotheses is very small even in legitimate scenarios • so false positives end up drowning out true positives Chronological rejuvenation Simmons, J.
