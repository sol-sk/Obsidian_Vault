For both tests, we either know µ or we know what µ will be if H0 is true 2. t-test estimates population standard error from sample standard error – Both σ !\" & 𝑠 !\" depend on sample size 3. t-distribution approaches normality as N increases; z-distribution is always normal – We choose which t-distribution to use based on our sample size (just like binomial) 12 Two methods for t-test p-value method • Set H0/H1, α • Calculate 𝑠 !\" • Calculate tobt • Determine p-value – We will not do this… • Compare p & α tcrit method • Set H0/H1, α • Calculate 𝑠 !\" • Calculate tobt • Look up tcrit (pp. 604) – We will do this! • Compare tobt & tcrit 13 Try it! Look up tcrit • We hypothesize that students in our class have a higher IQ than the population – We will conduct a one-tailed hypothesis test – We set α = .05 – We sample from 30 students • What is tcrit? Look on pp. 604 – Answer: tcrit = 1.699 • Remember df = (N - 1) for single-sample t-test 1415 Example t-test • Young people check their phones an average of 150 times per day – Do UBC students check their phones at a different rate than young people generally? • You observe 24 students from class and find: %𝑋 = 136 s = 10 16 Do UBC students use their phones differently? 17 µ = 150 %𝑋)*+ = 136 s = 10 N = 24 𝑠 !\" = 2.04 tobt = -6.8587 p < .0001 𝑠 !\" \t = , ( = tobt = !\"\t$\t% ' !\" = -. /0 = 2.0412 -12\t$-3. /..0-/ = -6.8587 Do UBC students use their phones differently? 18 µ = 150 %𝑋)*+ = 136 s = 10 N = 24 𝑠 !\" = 2.04 tobt = -6.8587 tcrit = pp. 604 tobt = −6.8587 Is tobt > tcrit , or is -tobt < -tcrit? If yes, then reject H0 tcrit = ±2.069 Formatted Conclusion • “Students at UBC checked their cell phones reliably less than the population on average, t(23) = -6.858, p < .001.” 19","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
