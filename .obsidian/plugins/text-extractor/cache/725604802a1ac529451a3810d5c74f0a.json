Warm-up: recap and expansion Guiding questions/citations/clips Preview of Wednesday’s reading Assembly Sign-up • 1952 (1995 in English) • Che writes the work first as travel notes, then as a polished version of his “diary” at 23 years of age • The text spans South America (Argentina-Venezuela), and showcases the friendship and personal growth of Ernesto and Alberto Granado.

In fact it’s probable, and there are no excuses, for these lips can only describe what these eyes actually see…” (37). “I am not the person I once was. All this wandering around “Our America with a capital A” has changed me more than I thought” (38). “You can either believe me or not” (38). “Improvisation” (39). “Overcome hurdles” (39). Questions to Consider (pp. 42-74) 1. On Friday, we established that Ernesto Guevara is from a middle-class or bourgeois upbringing in Argentina.

How does he talk about the act of “traveling” and what it means to him? 3. What are some of the difficulties (or ways in which they trick people!) that Alberto and Ernesto face during this first leg of their journey? Do they have problems to resolve their issues/fend for themselves? 4. How does Ernesto bring into his “notes” the following topics: being Argentine, social class and ethnicity, his personal life and preparation (medicine), identity (national, pan-American?, etc.)Director: Walter Salles (2004) Actors: Gaél García Bernal (México), Rodrigo de la Serna (Argentina) The Motorcycle Diaries: The Movie For Wednesday Read pp. 75-111 of The Motorcycle Diaries Continue thinking of the same questions posed during today’s class, and highlight some of the “photographic” glimpses of travels that Ernesto gives us as readers.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
