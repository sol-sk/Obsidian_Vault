Is there any clear argument? What was Cabezas trying to do by writing this book? 6) CONTEXT -Are there words/concepts you are already familiar with? -What words were you unfamiliar with? Are they important? 3) TONE Does Cabezas write in a certain tone (formal/informal) and/or emotion? Does this seem to change throughout or is he consistent? ACTIVITY How does Cabezas do what he does? 5) SOUNDS Read a paragraph aloud. How does it sound? Are there any patterns or “special” sounds that affect you as a reader? 2) PERSPECTIVE -What type of narrator are we dealing with? -Who does Cabezas tell his story to? Who is his “ideal” audience? 4) TECHNIQUES -Does Cabezas use any literary (metaphor, onomatopoeia, etc.) or rhetorical techniques? -Does he paint a picture for his reader? -Who is his “ideal” audience and how does he address it (us)? 1) WORDS -What do we know about Cabezas so far (after the first few chapters)? -What is the historical context he writes about? 7) THEMES -Can you pick out any themes yet? Do they relate to those presented in other rebel narratives we have read? What kind of narrator do we have? 3 minutes! “Before the Subtiavans started marching, they beat their atabales—you know what an atabal is? It’s a drum, a kettle drum. So the local committees went all through the barrios beating their drums: barangan-bangarán…barangan-bagarán. It’s muted, serious sound; it’s not cheerful, but it’s not sad either; it’s a tense sound: barangan-bangarán-barangan-bangarán-barangan-bangarán” (40).Mud Gondola Subtiava Eugenio Sandino campesino Dark Inner discipline and morale 5 minutes. What people, places and things inspire Cabezas to go to the Mountain? What is his mood when he gets to the mountain? How does he feel? Does that change?

If your group does not have a facilitator, you may choose to answer any of the questions under the “Assembly #7 facilitation guide” on Canvas [Canvas – Modules – Week 11 or Assembly Facilitation Materials] • Step 1: You will be in groups for 25 minutes. • Step 2: In the last 3-5 minutes of class, I will announce Discussion #7 (on Canvas!), where you will continue thinking through the topic of today’s Assembly. Discussion #7 • This week’s facilitators will post their “wrap-up” of their small group’s discussion of this topic in the discussion. • The rest of you will participate in the Canvas discussion by posing your thoughts (1 individual post to express your specific ideas and you should respond as well to 1-2 classmates’ ideas as well!). • To participate go to https://canvas.ubc.ca, Discussions - Discussion #7. You have until next Wednesday BEFORE class [11:59am] to participate! The earlier, the better! • On Monday: We will continue reading about/discussing Omar Cabezas’s experience from the Mountain. What is your view? Evaluate in a brief video how a core course concept of your choice evolves (or not!), taking into account 2 works studied (one from Part 1, and another from Part 2 of the course). Final Project! You may record the video in the program of their choice (Zoom, Mp4, Kaltura), and even do it in small groups of 3! The assignment may be an extension of some of the interests you have explored throughout the term in the Canvas Discussions, your Focused response essays, or even your Assembly Facilitation Guides! Due mid-April!","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
