Pause: Disaster Drawn Harvard University Press, 2016 Non-fiction comics are “a form of documentary, as a form of witnessing” (1) “There are many examples of the visual- verbal form of comics, drawn by hand, operating as documentary and addressing history, witness, and testimony” (2) “The essential form of comics— its collection of frames—is relevant to its inclination to document. Documentary (as an adjective and a noun) is about the presentation of evidence. In its succession of replete frames, comics calls attention to itself, specifically, as evidence. Comics makes a reader access the unfolding of evidence in the movement of its basic grammar, by aggregating and accumulating frames of information.” (2) Pause: Disaster Drawn Harvard University Press, 2016 “…there are so many difficult and even extreme world-historical conflicts portrayed in the form of comics…a site of documentary that is expanding as I write…” (4) 3 main questions Chute asks: 1. How do the now-numerous powerful works about world- historical conflict in comics form operate? 2. To what end, aesthetically and politically, do they visualize testimony? 3. How do they engage spectacle, memory, and lived lives—as well as extinguished lives? Pause: Documenting Trauma in Comics Palgrave MacMillan, 2020 “comics…invoke [trauma], play with it, revise it, challenge it, and in their most innovative moments, move beyond it. …” (8) “the comics form as a kind of ‘working through’ of trauma…comics document traumatic pasts, not trauma that is passed.” (21) “comics are not formal mirrors that simply reflect dominant symbolic frameworks, established cultural narratives, or psychic symptoms, but are in fact a generative force at the core of trauma itself, moulding and melding it into new shapes” (21-2). 3 main questions Davies & Rifkind ask: 1. Why are so many contemporary comics and graphic narratives written as memoirs or documentaries of traumatic events? 2. Is there a specific relationship between the comics form and the documentation and reportage of trauma? 3. How do the interpretive demands made on comics readers shape their relationships with traumatic events? Part II analysis – mini whiteboard activity: Guiding questions for analysis: 1. What types of panels do we have here? How many per page? Are there splash pages or bleeds? Gutters and frames? Emanata or Onomatopoeia? What might the purpose of these arrangements be? What types of shots are used, and why? 2. Is there meaning to be found in the use of text (internal/external dialogue), captions, as well as font? 3. Is colour used expressively/symbolically here? 4. Do any particular images stand out? Why? In small (or large) groups, choose one of the following segments from Part II. Keeping in mind the idea of comics as testimony/witness/evidence and a working through of trauma, as well as our 4 guiding questions for analysis (to the right), discuss the portrayal of the events that take place in the segment you have chosen. If you finish one, you can attempt another. 1. Bay of pigs invasion (PDF 34-55) 2. Sonya’s imprisonment & torture (PDF 57-69) 3. Sonya’s Dream (PDF 56, 75) 4. The return to “normal” (PDF 76-87) Wrap up: Part I and II discussion 1. Do you agree with the idea that for Sonya, the revolution is rather black and white (straightforward)? Does Sonya’s view of the revolution change from part I to part II? What textual (either visual or verbal) evidence do you have to support your opinion? 2. What is the role of art in the revolution? What is the role of revolution in art? 3. Can one dream of revolution? Can a revolution affect one’s dreams? 4. According to Lockpez’s story, is there room for charity and hospitality in the revolution? 5. Can we consider comics a form of documentary and witnessing? What is the purpose of using an alter ego? Can we still consider “autobiofictionalography” documentary and witnessing? 6. Can documenting one’s testimony through comics art be cathartic?
