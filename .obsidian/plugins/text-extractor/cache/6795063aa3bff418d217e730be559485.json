Allegory of a Massacre 50 years ago, Excélsior published a box by Abel Quezada that framed [an historic] period: a black canvas with a question that, in spite of the disqualification of documents, thousands of testimonials, books, and investigations, remains unanswered… Poniatowska frames the testimonials p. 199 “This is their story, woven out of their words, their struggles, their mistakes, their pain, and their bewilderment at the turn events took.” “In these pages there echo the cries of those Who died and the cries of those who lived on after them. These pages express their outrage and their protest: the mute cry that stuck in thousands of throats, the blind grief in thousands of horror stricken eyes on October 2, 1968, the night of Tlatelolco” Critical investigations • Look through pp. 199-208, and respond to the following questions. • What details can you piece together about the happenings of October 2, 1968? • Are there different sides or versions of the story presented? What details do we learn from such perspectives? • Who are the victims? Who are the villains? Is there clarity on this? What is there consensus on? “All witnesses agree that the sudden appearance of flares in the sky above the Plaza de las Tres Culturas at the Nonoalco-Tlatelolco housing unit was the signal that unleashed the hail of bullets which turned the student Meeting of October 2 in to the Tlatelolco tragedy” (202). “It is quite certain that even today the precise death toll has not yet been determined” (207). “At present (early in 1971) those still imprisoned in Lecumberri number about 165” (207). “We shall probably never know what motive lay behind the Tlateloco massacre. Terror? Insecurity? Anger? Fear Of losing face? Ill-will toward youngsters who deliberately misbehave in front of visitors” (207)?
