What is the task? Coordinate limb movements to achieve bipedal locomotion 2. What resources does the organism have? Natural “springiness” of joints, skeleton, muscles; counterbalancing via arm swing; limited degrees of freedom in e.g. knee ﬂexion; etc. 3. How can these resources be deployed to solve the task? Watch the video in the previous slide… 4. Any evidence that this is actually how the task is solved? (Not sure! But there is little doubt that human locomotion involves more than algorithmic joint-angle control.) 5 Tidy robots “Didabots” Control schematic Initial setup After “tidying” Maris, M., & Boeckhorst, R. (1996). Exploiting physical constraints: heap formation through behavioral error in a group of robots. In Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems. IROS'96 (Vol. 3, pp. 1655-1660). IEEE. 6 Flocking behaviour (boids) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4f_1_r80RY 1. Separation 2. Alignment 3. Cohesion 7 Outﬁelder problem 1. What is the task? “The ﬁelder’s task is to move themselves so that they arrive at the right place at the right time to intercept a ﬂy ball.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVBaKspcadQ8 Outﬁelder problem 1. What is the task? “The ﬁelder’s task is to move themselves so that they arrive at the right place at the right time to intercept a ﬂy ball.” Traditional explanation Predicting trajectory of ball using initial direction, velocity & angle. → Mental representation of the future location of the ball. 9 Outﬁelder problem 2. What resources does the organism have? • noisy estimates of distance / direction / velocity / speed (propagating through projection!) • continuous kinematic information (→ infer underlying dynamics) • ability to detect kinematic information • ability to locomote 10 Outﬁelder problem 3. How can these resources be deployed to solve the task? • heuristic solution: using perception & movement to oﬀset some aspect of complex kinematics • linear optical trajectory… 11 Outﬁelder problem 4. Any evidence that this is actually how the task is solved? • prediction-based solution predicts a straight path • real paths are typically curved! How do humans perceive AI art and its creative works? Is it considered less or more \"artistic\" and \"creative\" than human-made art (literary, visual, auditory)? For example, how would we react if we didn't know that the song to compare R and Python was written by an AI? 13 A-not-B problem 1. What is the task? Find attractive object hidden in location B after it has already been hidden twice in location A. (age: 8-12 months) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHkJ3InQOE14 2. What resources does the organism have? • visual input • activations in the sensorimotor cortex from previous reaches (~ a memory of those reaches) • visual attention & ability to perform visually guided reaches A-not-B problem 15 3. How can these resources be deployed to solve the task? • “memories” of previous reaches + visual information interact to create a new reach previous sensorimotor activation visual information new sensorimotor activation A B A B no prior experience prior experience with location A only A-not-B problem 16 4. Any evidence that this is actually how the task is solved? • model makes new predictions: • error should occur even if object isn’t hidden • error can be reproduced in older children too if the task is suﬃciently complex A-not-B problem","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
