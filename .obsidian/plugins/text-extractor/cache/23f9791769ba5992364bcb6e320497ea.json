The Chomsky Hierarchy • Type 3 (regular)? The Chomsky Hierarchy • Type 2 or 1… • we need some memory to keep track of dependencies such as… If she wins then I will be delirious with joy. She gave the penguin that ate the cheese that Ludwig hated a scarf. • the hierarchical representation of sentences is a way of doing just that (but we don’t need to go all the way to a Turing Machine) Elaborating our PSS • X-bar theory – “meta-rules” for generating phrases Elaborating our PSS • principles & parameters: language acquisition consists of ﬁguring out how individual languages realise these meta- rules Elaborating our PSS • innateness: the pre-conditions for language are species-speciﬁc, genetically coded and present (though not necessarily expressed) in humans from birth • modularity: the PSS that represents language does not share its architecture with other aspects of cognition (though it obviously interfaces with those other aspects)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
