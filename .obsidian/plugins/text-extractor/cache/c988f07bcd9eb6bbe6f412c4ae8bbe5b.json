Mode (Mo) 2. Median (Mdn or P50) 3. Mean ( !𝑋 or 𝑀, µ for population) 3 1. Mode is the most frequent observation – What is the mode of this data? 4 ID DV 1 9 2 5 3 10 4 5 5 10 6 5 7 1 8 10 9 10 10 8 1. Mode is the most frequent observation – What is the mode of this data? 2. Median is P50 or the score that splits the distribution evenly – 50% observations higher & 50% lower 5 ID DV 3 10 5 10 8 10 9 10 1 9 10 8 2 5 4 5 6 5 7 1 When N is even, get the mean of obs. directly above & below middle 𝑀𝑑𝑛 = (9 + 8) 2 = 𝟖. 𝟓 1. Mode is the most frequent observation – What is the mode of this data? 2. Median is P50 or the score that splits the distribution evenly – 50% observations higher/50% lower 3. Mean or average: (𝟏𝟎 + 𝟏𝟎 + 𝟏𝟎 + 𝟏𝟎 + 𝟗 + 𝟖 + 𝟓 + 𝟓 + 𝟓 + 𝟏) 𝟏𝟎 = 𝟕. 𝟑 6 ID DV 3 10 5 10 8 10 9 10 1 9 10 8 2 5 4 5 6 5 7 1 Σ𝑋𝑖 𝑁 8 !𝑋 cannot be used for ordinal data, but Mdn can! – Mean is more sensitive to skew & extreme scores U.S. Household Net Worth • 3 models of central tendency: – $692,100 – $97,300 – $20,000 910 Mean is a fulcrum (balancing point) 11 .𝑋 Median is also a fulcrum?! 12 Mdn Median is also a fulcrum?! 13 .𝑋 Mdn Lower Higher !𝑋 balances the magnitude of scores above and below - Assumes equal intervals separate values of variable Mdn balances the number of scores above and below - Assumes only that variable can be ranked lower or higher Median is robust to skew 14 Bill Gates is an Outlier 15 Outliers Skew Distributions • Outliers are highly atypical observations – As with wealth/income, the mean is highly sensitive to outliers • How can we deal with outliers? – Use the median as a model instead – Compare mean with and without outliers • Does the pattern of the data change? – Determine the source of the outlier • Is it a measurement error? Or a legitimate observation?16 “As preregistered, we excluded all RTs greater than 10,000ms…” 17 Robustness in the face of outliers & sampling variability Robustness to skew & outliers • Mode > Median > Mean Robustness to sampling variability • Mean > Median > Mode Mean is preferred to maximize consistency (then deal w/outliers later) When sample size increases, robustness increases! 1819","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
