Figures or Tables? • Either can work, but try both & see what human readers intuit most easily!! • Types of Figures: – Bar graph – Histogram – Frequency polygon – Smoothed frequency distribution 9 Bar Graph (pp 63) • Note: What is implied by disconnected bars? 10 Histogram (pp 64) • Note: ‘Squiggle’ on the left side indicates that the x-axis has been stretched 11 Frequency Polygon (pp 65) • Note: What is tacitly implied by this plot? 12 Me? I’m a smooth dude… 13 • Note: Smoothing increases simplicity, but can reduce precision if overdone Distribution shapes • The shape of distributions often reveals important information – Many statistics require certain shapes • Ideal distribution: Bell curve w/symmetry & unimodal 14 Skew 15 Or, statisticians are weird, so “just think the opposite” Mathematics Review Order of operations: Examples: 1. Parentheses ( ) [ ] { } 2. Exponents x^2, x2, or 𝑥 3. Division x/2 or ! \" 4. Multiplication x*2 or x ×\t2 5. Summation ∑ 𝒙 6. Addition x + 2 7. Subtraction x - 2 16 Summation • Summation is very common operation in statistics “Find the sum of scores for variable X, from i = 1 to i = N” ! !\"# $ 𝑋𝑖 17 X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + … XN Summation • Summation is very common operation in statistics “Find the sum of scores for variable X, from i = 1 to i = N” ! !\"# $ 𝑋𝑖 18 Stop here Start here Add these X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + … XN …the Greek letter ”sigma” makes me feel… 1 (‘at ease’) – 10 (‘very anxious’) 19 0.0 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 Ratedensity N = 66 • Sample of 5 participants for math review Rating Example…the letter ”sigma” makes me feel… Participant ID DV 1 9 2 5 3 10 4 5 5 10 20 X1 = 9 X2 = 5 … What is: How about: ! !\"# $ 𝑋𝑖 ! !\"% & 𝑋𝑖 Fortunately, we’ll mostly use Σ𝑋𝑖 Sum of Squares Participant ID DV (x) x2 1 9 81 2 5 25 3 10 100 4 5 25 5 10 100 21 Only 1 change: Now, calculate Σ𝑋𝑖 2 Σ𝑋𝑖 2 Remember order of operations!!
