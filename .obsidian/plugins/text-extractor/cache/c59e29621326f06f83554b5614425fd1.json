These cues trigger compensatory changes in body to prepare for more drug taking – Go to drug context and then don’t take drugs = conditioned withdrawal, b/c there is no drug to counteract the compensatory changes which are usually opposite to those caused by drug – Take drug in same context = conditioned toleranceb/c body has prepared itself to counteract drug Anti-drug effect (Hangover) Drug effect (intoxication) How you feel Homeostasis Compensatory responseDrug effect Conditioned Compensatory response Tolerance Conditioned Withdrawal Conditioned Tolerance 3 • Sensitization:for some effects, repeated exposure increases sensitivity to behavioural effects of drugsLocomotion First day AMPH (baseline) Repeated drug Test day AMPH Repeated saline After 5 days of drug or saline Amphetamine (AMPH)-induced locomotion. Classic effect involves 2 groups: 1) Gets low dose AMPH on Day 1 (test dose), then gets daily saline injections for 5 days 2) Gets test dose AMPH on Day 1, then gets AMPH repeatedly for 5 days. On test day, both groups get same test dose of AMPH again •After repeated exposure, locomotor response is much greater with the same dose of drug (the response has sensitized). •Locomotor effects of amphetamine caused by increase DA release •Drugs have multiple actions, some can develop tolerance while others sensitize in parallel.  ALL DRUGS OF ABUSE THAT HAVE ADDICTIVE POTENTIAL CAN PRODUCE SENSITIZATION to some of their effects Principles of Drug Action (V) 4 Addiction, What Is It? •Many people take psychoactive drugs recreationally, but even if drug use is quite frequent, they can control their intake: heavy drug use does not necessarily mean the person is an addict. • Three main factors we consider to qualify an individual as having a “substance use disorder”  1)Habitual drug use that persists in spite of the adverse effects it has on health and social life »May be viewed as a “chronically-relapsing disorder”  2) Drug seeking behaviour: a disproportionate amount of time spent thinking about (craving) and acquiring the drug  3) Physical Dependence: do they suffer from withdrawal from the drug –Can contribute to relapse in short term, but may not be a major factor contributing to long lasting effects of addiction. –Physical withdrawal last for a few days, but addiction can last a lifetime •Three ways we can classify drugs as having a high addictive potential are –Common sense (do these drugs appear to be habit forming) –Whether animals will self administer the drug –Physical Dependence used2bethegoldstandarddef Physical emotio p week Marijuwannnanana (I) •Low addictive potential: active ingredient is THC (Tetrahydrocannabinoid): from cannabis –receptors found all over brain (DA system, hippocampus, PFC, amygdala, accumbens.) –Receptors were found first, then neurotransmitter was discovered: Anandamide, acts as a retrograde messenger – Exact mechanisms for intoxicating effects not fully understood •Withdrawal symptoms are uncommon, but can occur •Technically defined as a hallucinogen, effects include: – Lower, social doses:  sense of well-being, dreamy state, altered sensory perceptions, increased “munchies”. – Higher doses: Sensory disturbances, emotional intensification, impaired motor, cognitive speech processes – In some instances, higher doses can produce transient psychotic symptoms (depersonalization, agitation, and paranoia) Glutamate or GABA presynaptic terminal Anandamie inhibits presynaptic transmitter release CB 1 receptor Hoatoutviadffnendogeffaflaia.hu'ates receptor 44m bliss I Table Effing justknowithasalotofeffectLOL t hypothal LOL mm i 6 Marijuana (II) • Health Effects with Chronic use:No reports of overdose. ― Smoking may damage lungs; reduce testosterone levels in men; Animal studies suggest it may impair immune resistance • Imaging studies:chronic use associated with some brain abnormalities •Associated with reduced activation in prefrontal/amygdala regions in response to emotional faces- deficits in appropriately judging emotional and affective cues? •Recent studies suggest a link between marijuana use & schizophrenia •Marijuana may precipitate development of psychosis in young individuals at risk of developing schizophrenia •THC has a number of medicinal effects (anti-nausea, analgesia, appetite stimulant, potential antidepressant properties) –Drug companies developing compounds that stimulate cannabinoid receptors for treatment of a number of disorders • Acute marijuanaaffects cognitive functions and psychomotor performance. –Impaired performance for a variety of verbal, spatial, time estimation, and reaction-time tasks. –Cannabinoids appear to interfere with all aspects of memory processing.  Basically, if you’re stoned, don’t expect to do well on cognitively- challenging tasks Areas of increased activation in controls > chronic marijuana users in response to angry faces NancyRegancommercial warondrugs gatewaydrug honkshooooo e gfmffnfym.tn Than words To dayaspectof memory basicallyimpossible If notasgood recognizing ihaveastoryaboutthis angryfaces diduknowcancerpaiten 7 Alcohol (I) •High addictive potential: Oldest of the recreationally-used/abused drug •2/3 of population consumes, 10% become addicted –Biphasic action: lower doses = disinhibition, euphoria, relaxation. – With increasing amounts, slurred speech, disrupted motor co-ordination, sedation, coma, death •Depresses neural firing in multiple ways. –Acts as a positive modulator GABA receptors (like benzodiazepines) –Reduces functioning of NMDA glutamate receptors –Blocks Ca2+ and other ion channels in neurons –Disrupts second messenger systems Neural firing before and after alcohol Stan I there Énotanagonist allosteric modylator makereceptor stronger sleep lectures thatkindofabigdifference 8 Fast firing GABA interneuron Low dose alcohol Alcohol (II) • Alcohol: facilitates activity at GABA receptors and reduces glutamate-NMDA mediated activity •Low doses preferentially suppress firing of inhibitory interneurons, can dis-inhibit cortex •Higher doses causes broader cortical inhibition – Alcohol increases DA release, but mechanisms not completely understood (mediated partially via interactions with opioid system) PFC Pyramidal Neuron Higher doses of alcohol iiiiiiiiiiiiiniiii.ie sizematters dopamine release takingoutsmneurons1stmakes fewerreceptors brainmoreexcitable boom obv ofsomeoneaskedabtSSRI's alcohol LOLL 9 •Many effects of classic “hangover” are due to increased levels of acetaldehyde (alcohol metabolite) or other forms of acute toxicity –Headaches, nausea, and abdominal cramps –Acetaldehyde can be excreted through sweat (exercise) •Dehydration and electrolyte/vitamin imbalance (via frequent urination) also contributes to hangover –Sports drinks/vitamins before bed can help offset Alcohol (III) – Hangovers and Withdrawal •Hangover is also associated with reduced opioid activity –Fatty/spicy foods can increase opioid release •Others hangover effects due to direct effects of alcohol or withdrawal – sleepiness (suppression of REM sleep) , sensitivity to bright lights/loud noises, anxiety, high blood pressure, rapid heart rate/breathing, sweating, vomiting. –Some of these effects may be offset by taking more alcohol • Alcoholics (i.e.: those that are physically dependent) have much more severe withdrawal (can be lethal) • Delirium tremens (DTs) can last 2-4 days. Can include hallucinations, delusions, confusion, hyperthermia, convulsions/seizures, unstable blood pressure etc. Not on exam 10 Nicotine (I) •High addictive potential: from tobacco •Stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, neural activity – Nicotinic receptors reside on DA neurons, main pathway that underlies the reinforcing/addictive properties of the drug • Effects in non-smokers: nausea, vomiting, coughing, sweating, abdominal cramps, dizziness, flushing, diarrhea. • Effects in smokers: less hungry, more alert, more relaxed –Over time, many of the aversive effects of nicotine develop tolerance, whereas some of the “rewarding” effects may sensitize.  Withdrawal: irritability, anxiety, restlessness, constipation, difficulty sleeping, concentration, increased appetite. •Addictive properties of nicotine linked to route of administration – Inhalation of tobacco smoke caused rapid/pulsatile increase in nicotine in blood/brain –Nicotine therapies (ie: nicotine patch) causes gradual, sustained increases in blood/brain levels of the drug- not as reinforcing. without waymoreslimhavereceptorsinbodytoo fear 11 Nicotine (II) •Multiple health hazards with chronic use (primarily from the smoke) •Its not ALL bad: nicotine has been shown to:  Improve attention/cognition in normal subjects (both smokers AND non-smokers)  Also improves cognition in individuals with Alzheimer's or schizophrenia  Decrease risk of Parkinson’s •Drugs are being developed to produce beneficial effects of nicotinic stimulation Nicotine (mg/kg) Attentional Performance (rats) Attentional Performance (non-smoking humans) •About 70% of people who experiment with smoking become addicted. –Compare vs alcohol (10%) or heroin (30%). •~ 20% of all attempts to quit are successful for <2 years 12 Opiates (I) •High addictive potential; originally used ~ 4000 B.C. –In order of potency; fentanyl > heroin > morphine>methadone >codeine –The rush: when taken I.V., initial wave of intense abdominal orgasmic pleasure that evolves to serene drowsy euphoria –First rush entices the user to do more, tolerance builds up, higher doses needed to get similar effect; never as good as 1st rush •Act as agonists for “endogenous opioid” receptors – Enkephalin and endorphinare 2 common endogenous opioid peptides- generally inhibit neural activity – Endogenous opioids mediate numerous functions (analgesia, emotional regulation, sensory/motor integration) – Receptors in the accumbens mediate pleasurable aspects of natural rewards (e.g.; sweet/fatty tastes) –Opioid receptors are on GABA neurons in the VTA. Activating these receptors inhibit GABA neurons, disinhibits dopamine neurons - DA Inhibitory GABA neuron Opioids work here to inhibit GABA neuron","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
