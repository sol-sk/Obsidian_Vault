Warm-up Literary language Closing questions Assembly Sign-up Warm-up: Remaining questions! Spotlight Strategy: Personification What is personification? Figurative Language: Additional Examples Anaphora Metonymy Metaphor Don’t seize the day (that doesn’t cut it), consider the past, present, and most importantly… the future in all of your endeavors (p. 100). Be the Enjolras (young, charismatic leader) of your generation… Closing thoughts… • The final 10 pages of the book represent some of the minds that have influenced Rodó and his work, Ariel. • Can you think of at least 5 people (thinkers, actors, authors, etc.) that have influenced your life so deeply that you would not be who you are today without having come into contact with them/their ideas/their way of thinking? The Assembly is an opportunity for students to guide/lead their peers in a discussion-topic, using their own interests/passions/d isciplines and the course materials assigned for the week! Learning goals: q Demonstrate analytical and planning skills; q Engage a variety of learners via personalized approaches to literary and cultural texts; q Practice active listening skills that promote participation and collaborative learning The Assembly Learning Cycle: 1. Facilitation Guide preparation and feedback process: Wednesday deadline, instructor feedback on Thursday, Friday facilitation 2. Facilitation: Small group facilitation of 7-8 students with 1 facilitator per group per week. 3. Canvas discussion moderation/follow-up: Weekly wrap- up, and facilitator-moderated Canvas Discussion The AssemblyAssembly Sign-up! You all have a sign-up sheet at your tables (if you don’t, that means that you are a small group, and we can guide you to join another for the Friday discussions!) Sign-up for the date/topic that most interests you! Don’t forget to write down the date/topic you’ve chosen! It is the only time you will facilitate this semester! J Extra details: • I will circulate the final schedule as soon as it’s filled up! • I will send a Canvas inbox message to all weekly facilitators the Sunday before they facilitate to remind them! • All Assembly Facilitation Guides are due on Wednesday evening by 5pm, the week that you facilitate! This allows me to give you feedback prior to your facilitate day! For Friday! • You can begin to read Ernesto “Che” Guevara’s Motorcycle Diaries. We will do an intro to Che and the work on Friday, and then hold a “Mock Assembly”!","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
