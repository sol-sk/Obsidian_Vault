Form.Septum4Intracranial Self Stimulation (I)•This form of instrumental learning is acquired quickly and rats respond at very high rates (higher than for food)•Rats will self stimulate until exhaustion-ignoring food/water to near death•Will risk harm to obtain access to self stimulationThis is AWESOME!stimulator6Intracranial Self Stimulation (II)SeptumPrefrontal cortexthalamusmidbrainHypothalamusNucleus accumbensMFBStriatumAmygdalahippocampusOlfactory bulbDorsal brainstem•Multiple brain sites found to support self-stimulation•Not a ubiquitous phenomenon; some sites do not support self stim, and stimulation of some sites is aversive•All brain regions that support self stimulation are directly/indirectly connected to the mesolimbic dopamine system•DA neurons are projection neurons: all cell bodies located in midbrain, send axons to many brain regions. Substantia nigrasends DA axons to striatum, involved in motor functions•Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA)is the heart of the mesolimbic DA system, sends DA axons via medial forebrain bundle to limbic regions such as prefrontal cortex, amygdalaand nucleus accumbens (NAc) region of the ventral striatum7The Mesolimbic Dopamine (DA) SystemVentral Tegmental AreaSubstantia NigraPFCamygdalaN. AccumbensMFB8Mesolimbic DA and Reward•Self stimulation increasesDA release in the limbic system, particularly the accumbens, •Reducing DA transmission reduce self stimulation•Similarly, animals will work to have DA agonists infused directly into accumbens•Natural rewards, or conditioned stimuli associated with rewards increased accumbens DA release These and other findings suggest DA plays an important role in reward-related approach behaviors•ALL DRUGS OF ABUSE with high-addiction potential (opioids, psychostimulants, nicotine, alcohol) increase DA release in the nucleus accumbens (through different mechanisms)Increase in NAc DA release when rats lever press for food9Principles of Drug Action(I)•Tolerance: Decreased sensitivity to effects of drug after repeated use. Two types:–Metabolic:Body (liver) becomes more efficient at metabolizing drug, less drug gets to sites of action–Functional(Pharmacodynamic):occurs at site in brain/body where drug exerts its effects (eg; receptor # decreases)•Tolerance develops to some effect of drugs, not others, and can develop at different rates for different effects–eg: heroin causes euphoria and can suppress respiration.–Tolerance to pleasurable effects develops faster than to respiratory effects. Heavy users increase dose to obtain a better high, but this can lead to overdose by over-inhibiting respiratory centers. Receptors that drug stimulatesdrugWith repeated stimulation by drug, the less compensates by reducing the sensitivity or number of receptors10Principles of Drug Action(II)•Withdrawal:Rebound reaction to elimination of drug from system after repeated exposure. •Typically opposite of the drugs action.–e.g.: after prolonged exposure to sleeping pills, withdrawal causes insomnia•May be viewed as body’s attempt to maintain homeostasis.–Drugs cause body/brain to initiate compensatory changes to counteract the effects of the drug (i.e.; tolerance).‒When drugs have been eliminated from system, these changes can linger for sometime after = [withdrawal symptoms]Additional drug taking can alleviate withdrawal•Individuals suffering from withdrawal symptoms are said to be physically dependent—severity of symptoms depends, but usually longer/greater exposure = greater withdrawal symptoms.11Principles of Drug Action(III)•Pavlovian conditioning can heavily influence tolerance/withdrawal–Drug effects can serve as conditioned stimuli. Brain will make associations between the drug effects and the context where they occurred•Conditioned tolerance: Tolerance is maximal when drug is administered in environments similar to those where drug effects were experienced previously.•Study: Alcohol causes hypothermia. Give rats 20 shots of alcohol in one environment (over 20 days). On test day, one group gets alcohol in same context, other group gets it in different context.
