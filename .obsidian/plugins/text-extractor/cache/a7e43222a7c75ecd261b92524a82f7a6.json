That’s RARE!! Height of z=3 (or 6’8”)? That’s RARE!! Test Yourself! • A fair coin is flipped 3 times; what is the probability of getting exactly 2 heads? a) 0.667 b) 0.375 c) 0.250 d) 0.125 • How many ways can we get 2 heads? – There are 3 different ways: 1. HHT, p = .125 2. HTH, p = .125 3. THH, p = .125 Sum(p’s) = .375 5 Binomial Distribution When N = 3 & P = .50 • p(2 heads)? • p(0 heads)? • p(at least 1 head)? Need 2 pieces of info: – N – Expectation for P event 6 5 Rules for Binomial Distribution 1. Series of N trials 2. Only 2 outcomes 3. Outcomes are mutually exclusive 4. Outcomes are independent 5. Expectation for P remains consistent Does flipping a fair coin meet these? 78910 Binomial vs. Normal Distribution • As N increases, binomial distribution approximates normal, z-distribution https://shiny.rit.albany.edu/stat/binomial/ 11 Binomial Table • We don’t need to plot all outcomes, there’s a table for that! – Appendix D, Table B (pp. 595-599) • What is the probability of getting 16 heads out of 19 coin flips? p(16 heads) – N = 19 – P = .50 – Answer = .0018 12 What is p(5 or more heads)? N = 7, P = .50 14 p(5 or more) = p(5) + p(6) + p(7) .1641 + .0547 + .0078 = .2266 What is p(5 or more heads)? N = 7, P = .50 15 p(5 or more) = p(5) + p(6) + p(7) .1641 + .0547 + .0078 = .2266 What is p(5 or more heads)? 16 p(5 or more) = .1641 + .0547 + .0078 = .2266 .2266 is the area under the curve when, P\t≥\t5 0123 4567 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 Binomial Distribution n = 7 , p = 0.5 Number of SuccessesProbability Evaluating probability in the tail of the distribution • What is the probability of 5 heads, or even more? Like 6 or 7 heads…or like being taller than 6’… 17 z-distributionProbability Inference from Binomial Distribution: Experimental Example (De Obaldia, 2022) • Research Question: Are mosquitoes attracted to certain people? • Method: Arm-in-Cage test tournament! • N = 20, P(bite X33) = ?? • a priori probability = ?? • a posteriori probability = ?? • How confident would we like to be? 18 5 Rules for Binomial Distribution 1. Series of N trials 2. Only 2 outcomes 3. Outcomes are mutually exclusive 4. Outcomes are independent 5. Probability of P remains consistent 19 Results • X33 bites = 15 • X28 bites = 5 – Pexpectation(bite X33) = .50 – Pobserved(bite X33) = .75 • How strange is this result, assuming our expected probability? • X25 bites = 12 • X28 bites = 8 20 Another example: Multiple choice 21 5 Rules 1. Series of N trials 2. Only 2 outcomes 3. Outcomes are mutually exclusive 4. Outcomes are independent 5. Probability of P remains consistent Does a multiple choice test meet these? Not usually! We’ll need to make a few assumptions 22 Will they pass? Student needs at least 50% score p(>4.5 correct) – N = 9 questions – P(correct) = .20 • Choices a, b, c, d, & e – Answer: p(5) + p(6) + p(7) + p(8) + p(9) = .0165 + .0028 + .0003 + .0000 + .0000 = .0196 23 Will they pass? • Student needs at least 50% score – N = 20 questions – P(correct) = .50 – Answer: p(10) + … p(20) = .5881 24","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
