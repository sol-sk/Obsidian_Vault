Sometimes it is higher than 50%, sometimes lower. At the end of your respective set of flips, who is likelier to have more had more days with 60% or more heads? ▪ A) You B) Your friend C) about the same 12 Inferential Statistics ▪ Use data collected on a sample to infer what is happening in the population ▪ Is the effect we found in our sample due to random chance, or due to a true effect in the population? 13 Common error 2: Failure to appropriately use probabilities ▪ Focus on specific rather than general information ▫ E.g., “Person-who” statistics (aka Base rate fallacy) Failure to appropriately use probabilities Ignore patterns Make up patterns I know this person who… Yeah but what about that person… 14 Person-Who statistic Pancreatic cancer by 150% Breast cancer by 50% Gastric cancer by 100% Leukemia by 40% Lung cancer by 330% Colorectal cancer by 70% Bladder cancer by 190% 15 “If the vaccine is so great, then how come people are still getting COVID and spreading COVID and, unfortunately, dying from COVID?” – Aaron Rodgers 16 Common error 2: Failure to appropriately use probabilities ▪ Seeing patterns in randomness to predict future outcomes Failure to appropriately use probabilities Ignore patterns Make up patterns 1718 ? 192021 Inferential Statistics Overview ▪ Null & Research Hypotheses ▪ Sampling distribution ▪ t-test logic ▪ Statistically significant ▪ Type 1 and Type 2 errors ▪ Apply your understanding 22 Inferential statistics ▪ Use data collected on a sample to infer what is happening in the population ▪ Is the effect we found in our sample due to random chance, or due to a true effect in the population? 2324 How to study? ▪ How does repeated reading of study materials affect learning? ▫ IV: Study method ▫ DVs: ■ Predicted recall ■ Actual recall Roediger & Karpicke (2006) SSSS SSSR SRRR 25 How to study? 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 SSSS SSSR SRRR Proportion of information recalled after 1 week 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SSSS SSSR SRRR Expectation of remembering material after 1 week","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
