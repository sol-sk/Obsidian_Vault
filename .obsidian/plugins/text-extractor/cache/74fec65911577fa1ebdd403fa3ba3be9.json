However, I have withheld answers to at least one problem in each chapter, due to requests from professors. The answers to these problems are given below. Chapter 1 6. a. (1) fear of smoking (2) number of cigarettes smoked (3) the 40 smoking adults who participated in the experiment (4) all smoking adults residing in the city where the psychologist works at the time of the experiment (5) the number of cigarettes smoked daily by each member of the sample during the 2-month post-film period (6) the mean number of cigarettes smoked daily by each group. 9. b. The sample scores are the 15 weights given. The population scores are the 450 weights that would result if all the hamburgers served on that day were measured.

The alternative hypothesis states that rhesus monkeys have a preference for either novel stimulation or repetitive stimulation. b. The null hypothesis states that in rhesus monkeys there is no difference in preference between novel and repetitive stimulation. c. p(0, 1, 2, 10, 11, or 12 pluses) = 0.0384. Since 0.0384 < 0.05, you can reject H0. Rhesus monkeys appear to prefer novel stimulation. d. You may be making a Type I error, rejecting H0 if it is true. e. The results apply to the rhesus monkeys housed in the university colony at the time of the experiment. Chapter 11 7. Power = 0.2969, beta = 0.7031 Chapter 12 21. a. The alternative hypothesis states that the student's technique affects the duration that schizophrenics spend in an institution. b. The null hypothesis states the student's technique has no effect on the duration that schizophrenics spend in an institution. c. zobt = -2.09, and zcrit = ±1.96. Since | zobt | > 1.96, you reject H0 and accept H1. The student's technique appears to shorten the duration of stay. Chapter 13 14. b. 117.01-122.99 (95%) ; 115.97-124.03 (99%) 16. a. The alternative hypothesis states that the effectiveness of training in mathematics at the private high school differs from that of the public high schools. b. The null hypothesis states that the private high school and the public high schools are equal in the effectiveness of the mathematics training they provide. c. tobt = 2.62, and tcrit = ±2.021. Since | tobt | > 2.021, you reject H0 and conclude that the effectiveness of training in mathematics at the private high school does differ from that of the public high schools. It appears to be better. Chapter 14 14. a. The alternative hypothesis states that the experimental birth control pill affects blood pressure, µD  0. b. The null hypothesis states that the birth control pill has no effect on blood pressure, µD = 0. c. tobt = 1.52, and tcrit = ±3.250. Since | tobt | < 3.250, you retain H0. The data are insufficient to allow you to conclude that the birth control pill affects blood pressure. 16. a. tobt = 4.00, and tcrit = 2.602. You reject H0 and conclude that the level of lead in the blood of children living near the smelter is significantly higher than that of 598 Selected Text Answers children living in an area relatively free from possible lead pollution. b. ˆ 1.97d  .

Planned Comparisons. tobt = 5.30, and tcrit = ±2.179. Reject H0 and conclude that 48 hours of sleep deprivation significantly affects the ability to maintain sustained attention. It appears to decrease this ability. h.

Retain H0 with regard to the 24-hour and 48-hour sleep deprivation comparison. Twenty-four- and 48-hour sleep deprivation significantly interferes with the ability to maintain sustained attention.

There is no difference in the effect of the two fertilizers. 21 aa   . There is no difference in the density of the three grasses. 321 bbb   .

There is a significant main effect for the type of fertilizer and the type of grass. The interaction was not significant (Fobt < Fcrit). It is apparent from the pattern of cell means that type 1 fertilizer was superior to type 2 fertilizer. The pattern of cell means also shows that Green Velvet grass was superior to the other two types. Therefore, on the basis of this experiment, you recommend Green Velvet grass and type 1 fertilizer. (You also receive a bonus for such a nicely conducted experiment.) 600 Selected Text Answers Chapter 17 18. 2obt = 18.00, and 2crit = 9.210. Since 2obt > 9.210, we reject H0. There is a relationship between these occupations and attitudes toward wage and price controls. Labor appears to be for the controls, business against the controls, and the professions fairly evenly divided. 29. a. The alternative hypothesis states that there is a difference in the degree of political conservatism of university theology and psychology professors. b. The null hypothesis states that university theology and psychology professors have the same degree of political conservatism. c. Uobt = 19, U'obt = 77. Since Uobt < 22, you reject H0 and conclude that theology and psychology professors differ in political conservatism. The theology professors appear to be more conservative. Chapter 18 13. a. zobt = 1.11. Since zcrit = 1.645, we must retain H0. We cannot conclude that this year's freshmen have a lower daily fat intake level. b. Power = 0.5793 c. Power = 0.8315. d.
