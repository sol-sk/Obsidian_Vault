And I won my Harvey from this. Which is funny... I got my Harvey for Coloring for using one colour.” Hillary Chute: Disaster Drawn Harvard University Press, 2016 Comics take “the risk of representation. “ “...in comics produced after World War II, despite the prevailing views of representing trauma after the Holocaust, we see that trauma does not always have to be disappearance; it can be plenitude, and excess of signification” (Disaster Drawn 5) Source: Hillary Chute | The Risk Pictures (rivalehrerart.com) Recap: Part II analysis – mini whiteboard activity: Guiding questions for analysis: 1. What types of panels do we have here? How many per page? Are there splash pages or bleeds? Gutters and frames? Emanata or Onomatopoeia? What might the purpose of these arrangements be? What types of shots are used, and why? 2. Is there meaning to be found in the use of text (internal/external dialogue), captions, as well as font? 3. Is colour used expressively/symbolically here? 4. Do any particular images stand out? Why? In small (or large) groups, choose one of the following segments from Part II. Keeping in mind the idea of comics as testimony/witness/evidence and a working through of trauma, as well as our 4 guiding questions for analysis (to the right), discuss the portrayal of the events that take place in the segment you have chosen. If you finish one, you can attempt another. 1. Bay of pigs invasion (PDF 34-55) 2. Sonya’s imprisonment & torture (PDF 57-69) 3. Sonya’s Dream s(PDF 56, 75) 4. The return to “normal” (PDF 76-87) Part III: Object Association Link these objects to a moment in the plot from Part III, aiming for a loosely chronological sequence of events. Talk not just about what happens, but the significance of those moments and objects for our protagonist and her revolution. Wrap up: Part I, II, III discussion 1. Do you agree with the idea that for Sonya, the revolution is rather black and white (straightforward)? Does Sonya’s view of the revolution change from part I to part III? What textual (either visual or verbal) evidence do you have to support your opinion? 2. What is the role of art in the revolution? What is the role of revolution in art? 3. Can one dream of revolution? Can a revolution affect one’s dreams? 4. According to Lockpez’s story, is there room for charity and hospitality in the revolution? 5. Can we consider comics a form of documentary and witnessing? What is the purpose of using an alter ego? Can we still consider “autobiofictionalography” documentary and witnessing? 6. Can documenting one’s testimony through comics art be cathartic? GROUP 1 Madison Wilde Rohtab Danny Castillo Rae Hu Mathew Manuela Assembly Groups! GROUP 2 Morris Cameron Sarah L.

My Revolution? • If you have a facilitator, they have prepared some questions for you. If your group does not have a facilitator, you may choose to answer any of the questions under the “Assembly #3 facilitation guide” on Canvas [Canvas – Modules – Week 5 or Assembly Facilitation Materials] • Step 1: You will be in groups for 25 minutes. • Step 2: In the last 3-5 minutes of class, I will announce Discussion #3 (on Canvas!), where you will continue thinking through the topic of today’s Assembly. Discussion #3 • This week’s facilitators will post their “wrap-up” of their small group’s discussion of this topic in the discussion. • The rest of you will participate in the Canvas discussion by posing your thoughts (1 individual post to express your specific ideas and you should respond as well to 1-2 classmates’ ideas as well!). • To participate go to https://canvas.ubc.ca, Discussions - Discussion #3. You have until next Wednesday BEFORE class [11:59am] to participate! The earlier, the better! • On Monday: We will review/wrap-up the Cuban Revolution, with some videoclips from Fresa y chocolate / Strawberry and Chocolate. The film is available on Canvas, and while it will not enter in the midterm explicitly, I highly recommend watching it! It brings together so nicely some of the perspectives we’ve discussed on the Cuban revolution and its (lasting) impact!","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
