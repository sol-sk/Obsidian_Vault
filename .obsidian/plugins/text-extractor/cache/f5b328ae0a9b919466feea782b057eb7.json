I use the concept of grafting to refer to the act of transplanting ways of knowing and being from a context where they emerge naturally to a con- text where they are artiﬁcially implanted. I start exploring this context through a poem that outlines the difﬁculties Indigenous people tend to face when inhabiting academic spaces whose architecture is built on the violent historical foundations of modernity. Next, I brieﬂy outline critiques of rec- ognition and inclusion in political and educational spheres to highlight how liberal discourses have tended to offer only conditional forms of integration that support dominant ways of thinking by presenting them as benevolent and inclusive. I then turn to a discussion of the implications of this analysis for Indigenous research methodologies. I conclude with tentative sugges- tions for further work in this area. Keywords: Indigenous, knowledge, methodology, onto-epistemology, grafting, imaginary, academia, decolonial, assimilation, racism, eurocentrism Introduction While recognizing the need for positive scholarship advancing the ﬁeld of Indigenous research methodologies, the main concern of this paper is the utilitarian risk to all- too-quickly instrumentalize and embrace Indigenous research methodologies as quick-ﬁx solutions to or escapes from deep-rooted and ongoing (neo)colonial think- ing. The contribution of this article lies in problematizing this process by offering a synthesis of insights and questions that have been asked at the margins or outside of the ﬁeld of education.

I argue that this form of thinking is inherently ‘Indigenous’ and that it can help us imagine each other, education, and research ‘otherwise’. My starting point is the difﬁcult paradox faced by Indigenous peoples across the world. On the one hand, there is the need to survive within modern societies based on an unsustainable single story of development as social-economic accumulation. On the other hand, there is the need to, at the same time, keep alive and pass down alternative possibilities for noncapitalist existence based on reinvigorated ancestral ways of knowing and being (Ahenakew, Andreotti, Cooper, & Hireme, 2014; Alfred, 2005; Battiste, 2002; Cajete, 2000; Coulthard, 2014; Kovach, 2009; Kuokkanen, 2008; Marker, 2004; Royal 2009). Mainstream practices and policies in education have focused solely on the former orientation, especially contemporary policies framed by ideals of economic competitiveness in global knowledge societies. Indigenous educational initiatives, while selectively supporting the ﬁrst orientation, have drawn attention to the second orientation in their call to protect, revitalize, and uphold the value of Aboriginal cultures, languages, and identities, emphasizing their contribution to global human heritage (Battiste, 2005; Donald, 2009; Penetito, 2010; L. T. Smith, 2012). However, recent scholarship has problematized how strategies of inclusion and integration of Indigenous knowledges have created a form of inclusion where dom- inant norms and populations still determine what can be said and how (Ahmed, 2012; Battiste & Henderson, 2009; Coulthard, 2014; Donald, 2009; Penetito, 2010). This can be seen when Indigenous culture is instrumentalized in the name of school attrition, retention, and achievement (Cooper, 2012). In this article I use the concept of grafting as a visual narrative for this process. Grafting is used in biology as the process of transplanting something from one organism into another (e.g., hybrid plants or cell/skin implants). Grafting, in itself, is neither good nor bad. Indeed, hybridity can be a generative process. However, in the context of grafting Indigenous knowledges into non-Indigenous ways of knowing, we are operating with severely uneven environments shaped by historical circumstances where the grafting/hybrid- izing does not happen as a mutual exercise, but as assimilation. Grafting, in this sense, can further contribute to the elimination of Indigenous peoples as distinct Indigenous peoples both in their relationship with the state, in their relation to the land, and in terms of the perceived worth of their knowledge. 324 CASH AHENAKEW This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000207.194.177.233 on Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:47:49 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms First, I start with a brief overview of problematic aspects of the interface between Indigenous and non-Indigenous ways of knowing. Second, I illustrate the complex context of Indigenous experience in the academy through a poem, and I address it through the literature. Third, I introduce the critique of recognition and inclusion at a broader political level through the recent scholarship of Glen Coulthard (2014) and Sara Ahmed (2012) before I turn to a discussion of implications for Indigenous research methodologies. Finally, drawing on the work of Vanessa Andreotti (2016), I present Vanessa’s cartography of frames of thinking of the modern subject that maps the reasons why inclusion/integration is inevitably problematic. I conclude with a few ideas of how we can begin to experiment with strategies to subvert grafting in Indigenous research. The Severely Uneven Interface Between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous World Views As a Cree scholar whose upbringing was outside middle-class sensibilities, I feel I have had to graft myself into the academic context. I wrote the poem ‘Academic Indian Job Description’ to express some of the difﬁculties I have experienced myself or have seen others experience in grafting their Indigenous subjectivity and grounded normativity (Coulthard, 2014) into academic contexts and expectations. Excerpts of this poem illustrate what is subsequently outlined in the literature.

The denial and denigration of non-Western ways of knowing has been part and parcel of European colonialism and a primary means by which the universality of Western knowledge was asserted (Andreotti, 2011; Santos, 2007; L. T. Smith, 2012) and used as a justiﬁcation for the dispossession, destitution, and genocide of popula- tions who were perceived to be lacking knowledge of universal worth (but who occupied lands of strategic importance). Contestation of this epistemological dom- inance has resulted in the successful exposure of Western prejudices against Indig- enous knowledge and growing inclusion of Indigenous worldviews in the curricula and research for mainstream schools (Battiste & Henderson, 2009). Notwithstanding the importance of these developments, a growing number of Indigenous scholars have critiqued the way this inclusion of Indigenous ways of knowing and being in mainstream institutions are conditional upon their incorporation into the onto- epistemological norms and values of liberal pluralism (Ahmed, 2012; Andreotti, Ahenakew, & Cooper, 2011; Coulthard, 2014; Grosfoguel, 2012; Povinelli, 2001, 2002; A. Smith, 2009). This critique points to the fact that when Indigenous knowledge is recognized by mainstream knowledge production mechanisms, it tends to be presented through the frames of Western epistemology rather than on its own terms. Yet, as Battiste (2002) suggests, ‘there are limits to how far [Indigenous knowledge] can be comprehended from a Eurocentric point of view’ (p. 2). Western frames cannot comprehend, for example, the way Indigenous knowledge places ‘animals, plants, and landscapes in the active role of teacher’ (Marker, 2004, p. 106) or the notion that knowing ‘literally GRAFTING INDIGENOUS WAYS OF KNOWING 327 This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000207.194.177.233 on Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:47:49 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms comes from the ground, above, and beyond, from the wisdoms of continuous meta- physical engagements and familiarity with ‘‘all our relations’’’ (Ahenakew et al., 2014, p. 222; see also Battiste & Henderson, 2009). Santos (2007) refers to this limitation of Western legibility as ‘abyssal thinking’, stating that, on one side of the abyssal line, there is knowledge considered to be objective and to have universal worth; on the other side there are values and traditions with only local (if any) value. Those who lean towards the edge of the abyss to explore what they can see perceive themselves as objective, neutral, and transparent (devoid of ‘culture’) and select and describe what they see according to what can be made intelligible within their own cultural referents and imaginaries. Kuokkanen (2008) sees this inability to think beyond one’s referents as the basis for mainstream’s society’s failure to recognize and reciprocate the gift of Indigenous ways of knowing. As a result, patterns of epistemological dominance remain in place, and cognitive injustice continues to be the central object of critique in Indigenous studies and other ﬁelds. In response, Santos (2007) advocates for developing an ‘ecology of knowledges’ that recognizes the ‘plurality of heterogeneous knowledges (one of them being modern science) and on the sustained and dynamic interconnec- tions between them without compromising their autonomy’ (p. 11). In this ecology, every knowledge system offers both indispensable gifts and limitations, which also means that each requires the complementary co-presence of other systems. In this article, I extend Santos’s insights to afﬁrm that many Indigenous worldviews are already multiepistemic, enacting the ‘ecology of knowledges’ he describes. For instance, Cajete (2000) has illustrated the Native American medicine wheel as a mul- tiperspectival and multimodal tool of engagement with the world (see also Ahenakew et al., 2014; Andreotti, Ahenakew, & Cooper, 2012). However, my main argument points to the practical difﬁculties that arise in the enactment of an egalitarian simul- taneity of incommensurable worldviews in a historical context of severely uneven grounds of negotiation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. Very sel- dom we ask what is lost in translations between global/cosmopolitan and Indige- nous/local knowledges (cf. Bhabha, 1994; Castro, 1992; Souza, 2012). Very rarely do we ask how Indigenous peoples cope with the conﬂicting demands that come from living in multidimensional worlds (cf. Abram, 1996; Alexander, 2005; Andreotti, Ahenakew, & Cooper, 2012; Castro, 1992; Ermine, 1995), as my poem illustrates. I draw on Indigenous studies and related literatures that emphasize the need to maintain a place for existential approaches to knowing and being alongside (though not in place of) political demands for more ethical recognition of Indigenous world- views (Aboriginal Education Enhancement Agreement, 2009; Alexander, 2005; 328 CASH AHENAKEW This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000207.194.177.233 on Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:47:49 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Buendia, 2003; Garroutte, 1999; Jackson, 2010; Mika, 2013; Royal, 2009). These theoretical insights suggest that in many worldviews, human knowledge cannot adequately capture the ineffable nature of our spiritual and material interdependen- cies and reciprocal obligations with both human and non-human beings, including the Earth itself. Appreciating these limits of knowledge might in turn enable more humble ‘conversation, not domination, with a range of relational knowledges’ (Alex- ander, 2005, p. 109), which could ‘support both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people to expand their frames of references and open new possibilities for co-exis- tence’ (Andreotti, Ahenakew, & Cooper, 2012, p. 235). In response to cycles of destruction initiated by colonial approaches to knowl- edge, in my conclusion I will use these theoretical insights to brieﬂy explore initial steps to transform spaces of knowledge production between Indigenous and non- Indigenous spaces, from conﬂict and appropriation ‘to sites of hope and possibility’ (Brayboy & Maughan, 2009, p. 2). However, before initial steps can be articulated, it is indispensable to take an honest look at the problems of inclusion without the need for excuses, appeasement, or angry accusations. This is the main task this article is set to perform. Looking into this problem in a nonutilitarian way (not expecting quick ﬁxes) is the only way to contemplate the magnitude of the task before us: the task of decentering and disarming the modern subject and her/his strong desires for prog- ress, futurity (conservation of privilege), anthropocentric and innocent agency, and totalizing forms of knowledge (Andreotti, 2014; see also Tuck & Gaztambide- Fern´andez, 2013). These desires normalize and naturalize the hegemony of modern subjects (both non-Indigenous and Indigenous) in deﬁning the terms of engagement with Indigenous cultures and prevents the emergence of other possibilities of co-existence that can accommodate ‘ecologies of knowledges’ and pluralities of being. In the next sections, I work through selected literature from the macro to the micro contexts of recognition of Indigenous worldviews in research to show how assumptions about the universal value of modern ways of knowing and being rigor- ous limits the legitimation of Indigenous ways of knowing in research methodologies. Acknowledging that the research and literature on Indigenous research so far has legitimately and mainly focused on the creation of interface methodologies that could support Indigenous people in carrying out research within academic spaces with/for Indigenous communities (Kovach, 2009; L. T. Smith, 2012), I want to take it a step further and focus on the barriers, difﬁculties, and possibilities of ethically working towards a different relationship. I acknowledge the inherent heterogeneity of Indigenous communities and the necessity of a collaborative academic task to GRAFTING INDIGENOUS WAYS OF KNOWING 329 This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000207.194.177.233 on Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:47:49 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms articulate the problems of representation, interpretation, and translation between different onto-epistemologies and cosmo-visions. Drawing on recent literature in Indigenous studies, I start with critiques that point to the wider social, political, historical, and institutional contexts of liberal recognition and then move to the speciﬁc contexts of Indigenous research methodologies. The Wider Political Project: Inclusion as Assimilation In the book Red Skins, White Masks: Rejecting the Colonial Politics of Recognition, Glen Coulthard (2014) states that the promise of reconciliation in the liberal politics of recognition is deceptive because it continues to serve the interests of the settler- colonial state. Coulthard argues that liberal recognition is a form of assimilation and that reconciliation is used as an excuse for settler-states to advance their project of access to and control of lands and resources, which ultimately requires the elimina- tion of Indigenous people as distinct people within a geographical space. The impli- cation of Coulthard’s argument is that ultimately, from the liberal perspective and power to deﬁne the terms of inclusion, Indigeneity is a difference that makes no difference to business as usual. Even when it is framed as challenging epistemological hegemony, inclusion is never meant to pose a threat to ontological or metaphysical hegemony. In this sense, Indigenous perspectives and peoples can be recognized and included only when they ﬁt within the frames of modern institutions. In addition, Coulthard (2014) draws on Marxist critiques of capitalism to show how capitalist accumulation depends on the exploitation and control of both labour and Indigenous lands. Therefore, the promise of inclusion into the capitalist dream of afﬂuence and social mobility, which is the dominant way of being, depends on the acceptance of integration as assimilation into a speciﬁc form of existence based on self-interest, wealth accumulation, and consumer consumption that only makes sense within, and is inevitably dependent on, markets and settler states. Coulthard shows how govern- ment apologies and other strategies of reconciliation serve to deny responsibility for ongoing colonization by placing colonial violence securely in the past and afﬁrming an agreement to ‘move forward’ where the terms of engagement are deﬁned by the economic interests of settler states. Similarly, Sara Ahmed’s (2012) book On Being Included: Racism and Diversity in Institutional Life shows how the uneven dynamic of this wider political project translates into institutional policies and practices of ‘diversity’. Focusing on ethno- graphic work carried out in higher education institutions in different countries, she 330 CASH AHENAKEW This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000207.194.177.233 on Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:47:49 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms illustrates how Eurocentric educational systems simultaneously give voice to and silence minority groups. She outlines how the will to ‘include’ diversity/Indigeneity in institutions, curricula, and research becomes a wall to diversity/Indigeneity. In other words, a commitment to inclusion may ironically and paradoxically be used to prevent the transformation of systemic racism within institutions because it rein- forces the naturalization of the ‘norm’ and prevents diversity/Indigeneity from becoming habitual. For instance, she illustrates how, by making diversity/Indigeneity visible, the mainstream is made invisible/normal and how beneﬁtting from diversity commitments creates a debt for diverse bodies. She refers to this as a politics of ‘stranger making’, ‘how some and not others become strangers, how emotions of fear and hatred stick to certain bodies, how certain bodies become understood as the rightful occupants of certain spaces’ (p. 2). She presents racism and whiteness as a disguised systemic phenomenon where one social group has the power to deﬁne what is normal, natural, and desirable in ways that make this very power invisible because the power itself is also presented as normal, natural, and desirable. Within this logic, if this group perceives Indigeneity as desirable, it will also deﬁne what is desirable about Indigeneity. This means that undesirable aspects, such as challenging the power to create deﬁnitions or making the invisible power visible, may not be tolerated. By announcing a declared commit- ment to Indigeneity, institutions and individuals have an excuse to avoid talking about their systemic racism. By creating a contained and controlled space for In- digeneity to be expressed, they naturalize their alleged normality as naturally benev- olent. Through strategies of inclusion created to ‘welcome’ the ‘stranger’ into educational spaces, dominant social groups reassert their territoriality. Thus, the Indigenous and other ‘strangers’ are made to feel as if they should perform to ex- pectations and even feel grateful for being allowed to exist in ‘other people’s’ spaces. Their success depends on whether they perform the authorized and expected content of Indigeneity they were brought in to express, as the poem illustrates. They are also expected to make those who have opened and enabled the space for diversity feel good about themselves. Echoing the complexities expressed in the poem presented before, a young Indig- enous female honours student has recently described her experience with this form of inclusion. They tell us they want Indigenous people here, but I feel that just the fact that I breathe for myself may offend them. I am constantly exhausted because I have to continuously watch myself in performing the gratitude expected of me, and I GRAFTING INDIGENOUS WAYS OF KNOWING 331 This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000207.194.177.233 on Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:47:49 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms never know if I am getting it right. They assume I want the same as they do and they cannot see or hear past that assumption. (Personal communication, March 12, 2015) The point that I am trying to make is that it is essential to have a broader critical view of the wider institutional context of inclusion and integration of Indigenous knowl- edges and methodologies in modern institutions in order to advance the promotion of Indigenous thought in academia with eyes wide open. I now turn to a discussion of grafting and Indigenous methodologies to illustrate the implications of this argument. Indigenous Research Methodologies For the past 15 years, Kaupapa M¯aori Research (KMR) has acquired the status of the most prominent Indigenous research methodology in academia and has been extremely successful in mobilizing discourses about and interest in moving beyond the colonial orientation of research about Indigenous peoples towards a research by, for, and with Indigenous peoples (L. T. Smith, 2012). KMR shifted the focus of traditional research towards improving Indigenous livelihoods, strengthening M¯aori language, and legitimizing Indigenous knowledges in modern institutions, especially in health and education. KMR has also been criticized from conservative (Openshaw & Rata, 2007) and progressive (Cooper, 2012) standpoints. The critique that is rel- evant for this paper is one that shows the paradoxes of KMR in trying, at the same time, to center M¯aori knowledge(s), to critique Western science (relying on critical theory), to legitimise itself in modern institutions (through publications and appli- cable and intelligible models), to raise the proﬁle of M¯aori in the imaginary of the modern nation state (speaking to national referents and desires), to provide a univer- sal framework that could be transferred to different contexts, and to honour hetero- geneities and speciﬁcities of different Indigenous groups within Aotearoa/New Zealand. While acknowledging the brilliance and success of KMR in holding spaces and inspiring Indigenous people to be involved in research, the juxtaposed aims inevitably create different types of unresolved and unresolvable contradictions, espe- cially when it is funded by modern institutions and the modern nation state, which both limits and constrains how far the boat can be rocked. In North America, both Kovach (2009) and Wilson (2008) have tried to challenge Western paradigms by proposing new Indigenous methodologies. Kovach recontex- tualizes many of the intentions of KMR in relation to Cree epistemology – and many 332 CASH AHENAKEW This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000207.194.177.233 on Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:47:49 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms of the inevitable contradictions. She acknowledges that the ‘indigenous research framework mirrors a standard research design familiar to qualitative researchers’ (p. 44). Her statement points to the challenge of introducing newness in terms that are intelligible and familiar to the dominant research ontology. Wilson addresses this challenge by talking about ‘research as ceremony’, focusing on relationships with ideas, concepts, and communities. He states: I found that an Indigenous research paradigm can also be understood in terms of its ontology, epistemology, axiology, and methodology. It is the uniqueness of these four elements that in part hold an Indigenous research paradigm apart from other research paradigms. (p. 71) Like Kovach, in using non-Indigenous ontological categories to translate or to make Indigenous processes intelligible, Wilson also reproduces a kind of grafting that seems to maintain primary loyalty to accepted notions of time, progress, reality, and being.1 Thus, when we are carrying out research in a context that is primarily non- Indigenous, using alphabetic and computer literacies (rather than orality and sensu- ous and metaphorical land engagement), being funded by the state (through our jobs or research agencies), and aspiring to be legitimised in academia, grafting is inevita- ble. As I mentioned before, it is not necessarily a problem as a strategic move (as L. T. Smith, Kovach, and Wilson can attest), but it becomes a problem when we cannot recognize what is lost in translation. What happens when the root of the plant and the land that sustains it are severed from the plant’s body? It is highly problematic when we assume that this is a neutral exercise without consequences or when we cannot even recognize that we are grafting. For those of us writing within academia, the ﬁrst small step we need to take is to make grafting visible. Making grafting visible means writing in a way that makes what is invisible noticeably absent so that it can be remembered and missed. Learning to write like this means resisting the temptation for certainty, totality, and instrumen- talization in Western reasoning by keeping our claims contingent, contextual, ten- tative, and incomplete. Another step, already used widely in Indigenous literature, is to make what is absent present, by using devices that redirect reading from a prosaic to a poetic orientation (Hiroa, 1974) or from the rational to the metaphorical mind (Cajete, 2000). The prosaic and rational readings that modernity has socialized us into try to capture the world in a monorational logic lodged in a mind separated from the body. The task of poetic and metaphoric writing is to invite other senses to take part in the reading process.

I propose that unless we look carefully at the frames of reference of the schooled modern subject, the ways we are oversocialized within it, and the dynamic of grafting, we will not be able to grasp the magnitude of the task before us, and we continue to risk mistaking assimilation for resistance when we promote Indigenous practices in aca- demia. To illustrate this proposed ‘way forward’, I now turn to an exercise of mapping that was developed by Andreotti (2016) to exemplify how the onto-epistemological grammar of modernity (see Ahenakew et al., 2014) persistently circumscribes what we can imagine as ‘recognition’, ‘inclusion’, and ‘alternatives’. The Limits of the Modern Subject Andreotti (2016) has produced several cartographies that help visualize investments, desires, paradoxes, and contradictions (that are often denied) in our oversocialization in modern ideals. The cartography of the modern subject (reproduced here with permission from Andreotti as Figure 1) represents the frames of reference of 334 CASH AHENAKEW This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000207.194.177.233 on Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:47:49 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms modernity juxtaposed on a square-headed Cartesian subject who ‘thinks, therefore he is’ and whose relationship with the world is mediated by her/his cognitive repertoire of meanings, rather than by her/his senses. Each side of the square head represents different and enduring referents that circumscribe her/his relationship with reality. Although not all referents may surface at the same time, they ascribe coherence and legibility to what we recognize as research and research methodologies. The angles of Boxhead represent desires for seamless progress, development, and evolution carried out by human agency through the use of objective knowledge to control the envi- ronment and engineer a perfect society. Each referent brackets a way of creating meaning that buffers his sense of reality. Logocentrism compels him to believe that reality can be described in language (Andreotti, 2016). Universalism leads him to understand his interpretation of reality as objective and to project it as the only legitimate and valuable worldview. Anthro- pocentric reasoning makes him see himself as separate from nature and having a mandate to manage, exploit, and control it. Teleological thinking makes him want to plan for the engineering of a future that he can already imagine. Dialectical thinking makes him fall in love with a linear logic enamoured with consensus, solu- tions, and resolutions and averse to paradoxes, complexities, and contradictions. Allochronic and evolutionary thinking make him judge others according to criteria where he is represented as being in the present of (linear) time while others are in the past and where he leads humanity in a single path of evolution.

However, if we imagine his life-force as the line that draws the box, we may gain three important insights. First, that the very desire for an outside of the box comes from within the box itself; therefore escaping the box is not really an option as it only re-inscribes the box. Second, that we are already free to draw different things—but as a line that draws, we are viscerally entangled with each other and entrapped within historical/collective choices. So, third, in order to draw different things, we need to use reason itself to analyze the existing angles of the box and consider the full extent of these choices for the past 500 years and seven generations to come. In this sense, we might hold our Boxhead modern subject not as a pathology to be demonized, but as a teacher offering important lessons. (p. 84). The Boxhead picture helps us recognize that we have historically inherited an imaginary circumscribed by speciﬁc referents and that these referents also form the DNA of our modern institutions and forms of knowledge production, especially educational and research institutions. These institutions have a speciﬁc national mandate to reproduce these referents to construct a sense of social cohesion and intelligibility, which has the effect of reproducing onto-epistemic hegemony. Thus, our self-image and desires for security, certainty, control, comfort, and autonomy have depended on the reproduction of these referents and the denial of other pos- sibilities of knowing or being. In this context, Indigenous logics are only welcome when they do not effectively threaten to change the status quo, when it is made the ‘same’. In this sense, Indig- enous knowledges and methodologies can be either incorporated as a colourful (but insigniﬁcant) alternative to what is considered ‘normal’, which conﬁrms the benev- olence of the proponent of inclusion, or perceived as something that is already integral to the dominant logic and therefore also insigniﬁcant, given that it offers nothing new. The all-too-common resistance to Indigenous difference is based pre- cisely on a desire for the security of ‘remaining the same’ and keeping power (the universalization of one type of knowing and the subordinate position of certain knowers) ﬂowing in ways that are ‘safe’ to those in a position to choose to ‘tolerate’, ‘include’, or ‘integrate’ Others. Andreotti’s (2016) framework may help educators and researchers have a glimpse of the magnitude of the task of imagining beyond our colonial historical legacies in terms of conﬁgurations of thought, affect, and in(ter)dependence (Andreotti, Fa’afoi, Sitomaniemi-San, & Ahenakew, 2014). It prompts us to move from sense-making to 336 CASH AHENAKEW This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000207.194.177.233 on Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:47:49 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms sense-sensing, displacing the centrality of Western reasoning. It also may help us address the systematic production of ignorance precisely when one is claiming to ‘know’, to ‘help’, to ‘represent’, to ‘give voice to Indigenous people’, or to ‘integrate’ Indigenous in research. Concluding Thoughts This paper was written to begin to ‘make what is invisible noticeably absent’ during the instrumentalization of Indigenous knowing and being in research. While appre- ciating the need for advancing the use of Indigenous methodologies in academic settings, this article calls for a careful consideration of the paradoxes and limitations of translating insights between Indigenous and non-Indigenous spaces. My objective was not to discourage people from taking up Indigenous methodologies but to encourage us all to do so with critical eyes wide open in relation to the agendas of institutions and to our own imperfect translations. I have used the concept of ‘grafting’ to draw attention to the need to historicize the referents that circumscribe modern subjectivities and knowledge production – the framework that determines the intelligibility of Indigenous knowledges in academic settings. My argument is that grafting is inevitable, but it only becomes a problem when its existence and limits are not recognized. I proposed three small steps to subvert grafting in the research process: (1) making grafting visible by highlighting the absences of our modes of inquiry and learning how to write tenta- tively about our data and ﬁndings, (2) using metaphor and poetry to disrupt sense- making and prompt sense-sensing in the experience of readers, and (3) turning our attention to and historicizing the referents that circumscribe Western frameworks of reasoning so we can recognize these referents in our researcher-selves and in our writing. In my tentative efforts to resist and subvert grafting, I included poems and a drawing in this text as illustrations of the process of mobilizing ancestral literacies that can appeal to the senses and displace the obsessions of the modern intellect.
