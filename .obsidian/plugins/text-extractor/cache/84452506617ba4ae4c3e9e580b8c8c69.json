D., Chomsky, N., & Fitch, W. T. (2002). The faculty of language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? Science, 298(5598), 1569-1579. • … but the debate can still be pretty vitriolic! 2 A few key concepts • principles & parameters: language acquisition consists of ﬁguring out how individual languages realise meta-rules • e.g. • principle: an X’ contains a head and a complement (e.g. X’ = ate an apple) • parameter: A. the head precedes the complement B. the head comes after the complement 3 A few key concepts • principles & parameters: language acquisition consists of ﬁguring out how individual languages realise meta-rules V’ V NP ate an apple V’ VNP tabetaringo o 4 A few key concepts • innateness, weak version: language relies on species-speciﬁc, genetically coded cognitive and physiological features that are present (though not necessarily expressed) in humans from birth • e.g. … 5 The descended larynx 6 The descended larynx 7 A few key concepts • modularity: the language faculty = an “organ” whose internal representations & processes are domain-speciﬁc and is informationally encapsulated (i.e. does not need to continuously refer to other cognitive systems to operate) • evidence: • uniqueness of structures (no parallels to phrase- structure outside of language?) • double dissociations (general cognitive deﬁcits do not necessarily aﬀect language and vice versa) • … 8 A few key concepts • innateness, strong version: language relies on a modular language faculty that is species-speciﬁc, genetically coded and is present (though not necessarily expressed) in humans from birth 9 Exercise Try to design a toy-language that deviates from one or more universal (or near-universal) features of language. Some example universals: • constituents & hierarchical structure • arbitrariness (e.g. the shape of words typically doesn’t suggest their meaning) • recursion (you can embed a certain type of constituent inside the same type of constituent) • nouns / verbs (maybe not universal) Name your language. Translate the following three sentences into your language: Penguins eat stinky ﬁsh. Stinky ﬁsh eat penguins. Penguins eat stinky ﬁsh that eat stinky algae. 10 Tomasello Pinker Language is not an instinct Language is an instinct Language is a PSS 11 Tomasello (1995) • arguments against innateness • universality of language (all cultures have it) • species-speciﬁcity ≠ genetic coding • language universals: • are they really universal? (e.g. sign languages, nouns / verbs, etc.) • English-centric… • universally present ≠ genetic coding! (see above) 12 Tomasello (1995) • arguments against modularity • domain-speciﬁc representations – many other examples where it would be diﬃcult to argue for true modularity (e.g. chess) • double dissociation • linguistic savants – impairments in other areas too? • speciﬁc language impairment – not truly speciﬁc? • brain localisation – Broca’s area vs. Wernicke’s area – not really! (also, localisation can emerge without genetic coding) 13","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
