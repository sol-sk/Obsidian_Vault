In some cases, this was shown in a mixed greeting. One infant hunched her upper body and shoulders at hearing her mother’s call, then broke into extravagant laugh-like screeches with an excited forward movement. Her braying laughter became a cry and distress-face without a new intake of breath as the infant hunched forward. Then suddenly she became silent, blank and dazed. A few infants had an immediate expression of fear, or sadness mixed with fear, although such expressions were of brief duration.” 78 https://vimeo.com/187746990 9 https://vimeo.com/187746927 10 https://vimeo.com/187746926 11 https://vimeo.com/187749184 12 Indigenous peoples’ research ▪ Indigenous research methodologies make heavier use of qualitative methodologies than mainstream academia ▪ Cultural practise of oral tradition  greater comfort in expressing ideas 13 Indigenous peoples’ research ▪ Research involving Indigenous communities require relationship building ▫ Research timelines much longer than conventional projects ▫ Talking Circles as a research methodology: 14 Error 404 – Indigenous research Not Found ▪ Mainstream academia’s reliance on quantitative methodologies – Indigenous knowledge receives little recognition ▪ Many academics not trained in interpreting qualitative data ▪ Few Indigenous researchers (vs. non-Indigenous researchers) ▫ Not enough people producing Indigenous knowledge; what exists is ignored 15 Other methods… ▪ Case studies ▫ Very common in, but not exclusive to, clinical psychology ▫ Studying specific cases in great detail 16 Other methods… 17 1518 Other methods ▪ Archival research ▫ Gathering information through archival records (e.g. statistical reports, newspaper articles, speeches) ▫ Researchers use content analysis to analyse documents and records","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
