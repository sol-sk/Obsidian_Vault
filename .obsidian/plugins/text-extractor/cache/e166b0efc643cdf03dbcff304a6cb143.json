Sensitivity – Before/after data, find detectable effect size given: – α, (1 - β), N 24 Setting Power • Exp. 1: “We sought to collect 80 participants… Sensitivity analysis indicated with power set at .80, we could detect an effect size as small as dz = .317” 3. Sensitivity power b/c we don’t know the size of the effect • α = .05 • (1- β) = .80 • N = 80 25 Setting Power • Exp. 2: “Based on the observed effect size of dz = .430 in Experiment 1, we sampled from 48 participants to set power at .80” 1. Use a priori power after getting an estimate of effect size in Exp. 1 • α = .05 • (1- β) = .80 • Effect size = dz = .430 2627 Were the coins ‘rigged’? • Coin flips were used to decide the allocation of 6 delegates in Iowa (2016) • If we’re testing whether these coin flips were somehow rigged, what are our hypotheses? • How can we test these hypotheses? – What is our expectation given H0? – One-tail test or two-tail test? – What level of Type I error should we accept? 2829","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
