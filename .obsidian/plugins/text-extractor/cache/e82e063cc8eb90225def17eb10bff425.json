How might college students and non-college students differ? ● Boundary conditions ▫ A lot of research is on very basic processes ■ People have similar basic processes (e.g. vision systems), regardless of whether they’re college students or not ▫ College populations are actually very diverse spanning many income levels, ethnicities, ages, and other demographics 13 Generalisability ▪ Different levels of generalisability: 14 Generalisability – Settings ▪ Other experimental settings (experimenters running a study) ▫ One experimental setting may not generalise to other experimental settings ▫ Interaction effects between participant and experimenter a big factor ■ Psychosocial effects ■ Biosocial effects ▫ Problematic when running in different labs ▪ Solution: Standardise interaction between experimenters and participants 15 Generalisability – Settings ▪ The “real world” ▫ Studies that resemble real world = high ecological validity ■ Mundane realism = when the task resembles something that one would engage in in everyday life ▪ Solution: Find or create DVs and procedures high in mundane realism 16 Generalisability – Settings ▪ The “real world” ▫ Studies that resemble real world = high ecological validity ■ Experimental realism = when the setting induces a realistic experience, even in an artificial setting ▪ Solution: Include more realistic designs (within reason) 17 Generalisability – Settings In lab setting In more realistic setting Tell participants about genetic/environmental explanation for crime Ask them how guilty they think some perpetrator would be Provide realistic case report with explanation for crime Ask participants to pass judgment on perpetrator in case report 18 Generalisability – People ▪ College sophomore problem – already discussed this ▪ “Solution” – collect samples outside of college, and statistically analyse whether their responses are different ▫ Look for interactions! 19 Generalisability – People ▪ Demonstrable differences between men and women (psychological literature on other genders lacking) ▪ Different genders may interpret variables differently, or respond differently ▪ Solution: Include different sexes and genders as participant variables to analyse responses ▫ Look for interactions! 20 Generalisability – People Gender Women Men Game violence Mortal Kombat 5.05 7.01 6.03 PGA Tour 4.61 4.60 4.60 4.83 5.80 +1.43+2.41+0.44 OVERALL: Stronger white noise after violent game Way stronger white noise A bit stronger white noise 21 Generalisability – People ▪ People from different cultures differ in many measurable ways 22 Generalisability – People ▪ Solution: Collect data from other cultures ▫ Look for interactions!
