Today’s objectives Reminiscences (1961) The Cuban Revolution on the Sierra Maestra 1956-1959: the arrival of the Granma- the trek through the Sierra Maestra Che’s transformation from rebel-leader Fighting strategies Peasant Support The guerrilla rebel the new man Warm-up: A word from our author Why does Che write Reminiscences, according to his “Prologue”? -First person account – fragmented -Published after the triumph of the Cuban Revolution (1959) and in the context of Castro’s speech Words to the Intellectuals (1961) -Che, in this moment, is, the face of transcontinental revolution… -And he is extremely well-read ... and artfully rhetorical… What should we look out for in Che’s Reminiscences?Guiding Questions 1. What is the condition of the rebel troops upon arriving to the Sierra Maestra? 2. What details does Che include/exclude from his narrative? Why do you think he does this? 3. What details of his specific (personal) experience does he include? Does his experience differ from that of the other rebels? 4. What are some of the issues that Che and the other rebels face early on in the fight? Is there a remedy for them? 5. Can you see some of the concepts/thematic lines that Che brings out in “A Child of My Environment” in Reminiscences? What other topics/concepts/themes begin to arise? 6. How do you find Che’s writing style? Is this a different Che from the one we read in The Motorcycle Diaries? The literary classification of Che’s Reminiscences TESTIMONY (Narratives of urgency and resistance) Based on eye witness account Emphasis on history and truth Literature (Lasting impact, market dependent) Aesthetic, social and linguistic standards and emphasis Often based on human values, not necessarily “true” Political Agenda Practice | Theory Editors/Translators? Terry Eagleton, The Event of Literature (2012) John Beverley. Testimonio: On the Politics of Truth (2004) \\ Che’s Literary and Rhetorical Strategies False Modesty • Give the appearance of modesty (but really believe the contrary) Teaching by Contraries • Use opposite ideals to promote the “right” path (similar to a fable) Hindsight | Moral • We must learn something from this (and we already did… look at us!) Ellipsis… Hyperbole How do you observe these literary classifications and rhetorical strategies in the content of today’s chapters?? The Morale and Discipline of the Troops • 1. Does the chapter, “The Morale and Discipline of the Revolutionary Fighters” represent a narrative shift in Reminiscences? Why or why not? • 2. What broader lesson(s) do you think Che hopes we will take away from this chapter? ----------------- Death of a Traitor • 1. Does the content of “Death of a Traitor” bring together some of the testimonial and literary characteristics and/or rhetorical strategies we discussed earlier in class today? Which ones and why? • 2 Why do you think Che dedicates so much textual space to Eutimio Guerra, a traitor of the Revolution? 7-10 minutes! Wrapping up and looking forward to Friday Noteworthy Examples (Morale and Discipline) The Rebel Army | Vanguard (The Mountain | trajectory) Frank País (the City) Fidel Castro? El Patojo Poor Examples (and punishments) The Reinforcements Batista’s Troops Traitors (Eutimio Guerra) Weak individuals (Morán, the deserter) For Friday • Reminiscences: “Bitter Days,” “Reinforcements,” “El Patojo” • 1. How does Che open the “Bitter Days” chapter, and why? Why are they, in fact, “bitter days”? • 2. Who are the reinforcements, a nd how does Che describe them, and who does he compare them to? • 3. Who is “El Patojo,” and does Che dedicate an entire chapter of his book on the Cuban Revolution • to a man who didn’t even fight in the movement? Bibliography • Beverley, John. 2004.
