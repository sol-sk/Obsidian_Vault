It’s also true that we dep en d o n o ur fratern ity an d so ro rity to gether, o ur frien dship s to gether. We ackn o wledge that we n eed o n e an o ther, we who walk abo ut o n the earth. We exten d greetin gs an d than ksgivin g to each o ther, so be it o ur min ds. We walk abo ut o n the earth, she sup p o rts o ur feet, an d we have been in structed that we will call her o ur Mo ther, the earth. It is go o d when we co me to gether that we remember her, an d we thin k abo ut what we o we her. We exten d greetin gs an d than ksgivin g to o ur Mo ther, the earth, so be it o ur min ds. We lo o k abo ut us an d we see gro win g fro m the earth also the small grass life an d herb life, thrush life. We kn o w that fro m these thin gs we get man y thin gs that we n eed. We get fiber to make thin gs with, medicin es, an d even fo o d.

There are o thers, to o , as we walk abo ut an d see the waters. We see man y differen t kin ds o f water. The waters that flo w in small streams an d the o n es in great rivers an d the o n es in great o cean s, an d we also see that water is very cen tral to o ur life. Abo ut the first thin g we do in the mo rn in g when we get up is we use water to wash o urselves with, we use it to co o k with. We n eed the water. Within o ur vein s flo ws that water. We wan t to exten d greetin gs an d than ksgivin g to the waters an d all the water life, so be it o ur min ds. There is an o ther: As yo u lo o k abo ut, what gro ws within o ur sight is the n ew tree life. The tree life also p ro vides us with medicin es, wo o d that keep s us warm, thin gs we use to build o ur ho uses, but it do es mo re than that. It also p ro vides us with beauty, thin gs that we can see an d ap p reciate abo ut the wo rld we live in . Amo n g tho se, there’s a leader; in the wo rld I co me fro m it is the map le syrup tree.

Let us thin k abo ut all the bird life, esp ecially that o f the greatest birds—the eagles an d the high-flyin g birds, to o , the migrato ry birds. We exten d greetin gs an d than ksgivin g to all the bird life, so be it o ur min ds. As we walk up o n the earth, we see that there are o thers: fo ur-legged bein gs that are related to us, an d these fo ur-legged bein gs also exist in a way in the wo rld that brin gs us delight an d brin gs us go o d cheer o f o ur min ds. To all o f the fo ur-legged beasts an d all o f the an imals that walk abo ut o n the earth, we exten d greetin gs an d than ksgivin g in the same sp irit that we exten d the greetin gs an d than ksgivin g to o thers. An d there’s an o ther. As we lo o k up higher in to the sky we see, also , that there is the o n e that walks acro ss the sky in the daytime an d brin gs light. That’s the o n e that we call o ur elder bro ther, the sun . Let us thin k abo ut that sun . It is the o n e that rep resen ts the p o wer o f the un iverse.

When we lo o k up high in the sky, we can see that there are the stars that rep resen t the face o f the un iverse, un kn o wable to us, with kn o wledge that we’ve already fo rgo tten . We wan t to exten d greetin gs an d than ksgivin g to all o f that, to all o f the un iverse, to all the life o f the un iverse, so be it o ur min ds. Fin ally, there’s an o ther.

This is the talk that o ur p eo p le give at the begin n in g an d at the en d o f every gro up gatherin g, so that we remember o ur relatio n ship s.

MELISSA K. NELSON, TURTLE MOUNTAIN CHIPPEWA, EDITOR AND PAST BIONEERS BOARD MEMBER CLAYTON THOMAS-MULLER, CREE NATION, BIONEERS BOARD MEMBER KENNY AUSUBEL, BIONEERS FOUNDER AND CO-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR PREFA C E Re me mb e ri ng th e Ori g i na l I nstructi ons I wep t rep eatedly at the beauty an d wisdo m p ain ted by the vo ices an d visio n s o f the First Peo p les an d their allies in these n umin o us p ages. They reveal a “ho use made o f sto ries,” in N. Sco tt Mo maday’s p hrase. They embo dy so me o f the mo st an cien t wisdo m o n earth fro m the wo rld’s “o ld- gro wth cultures.” It’s p recisely what human ity mo st n eeds n o w to slip thro ugh this ep o chal keyho le o f histo ry where the stakes are the very survival o f o ur sp ecies an d co un tless o ther bein gs in the web o f life. It’s a jo urn ey to retrieve the Origin al In structio n s fo r ho w to live o n earth in a go o d way, in a way that lasts. It’s a jo urn ey to reco ver the sacred. As we en ter the turbulen t o n set o f glo bal en viro n men tal co llap se, these teachin gs remin d us that what we do to the earth, we do to o urselves. Of eq ual imp o rtan ce, what we do to each o ther, we do to the earth. We’ll have p eace with the earth o n ly when we have p eace with each o ther, as Chief Oren Lyo n s says. An d we’ll have p eace with each o ther o n ly when we have justice. Part o f the Origin al In structio n s resides in Traditio n al Eco lo gical Kn o wledge ( TEK) . Fo r millen n ia, In digen o us Peo p les have acted as guardian s o f the bio lo gical diversity o f the p lan et. They’ve successfully man aged co mp lex recip ro cal relatio n ship s between diverse bio lo gical an d human cultures, with their eyes o n the time ho rizo n o f seven gen eratio n s to co me. This is high-TEK that has already so lved man y o f the en viro n men tal challen ges threaten in g human ity to day. It sho ws ho w human bein gs can actually p lay a richly p o sitive ro le in the web o f life as a keysto n e sp ecies that creates co n ditio n s co n ducive to life fo r all bein gs. As Native American resto ratio n eco lo gist Den n is Martin ez o bserves, human ity has n ever faced glo bal eco lo gical co llap se befo re. To get thro ugh this keyho le, we’re go in g to n eed the en durin g kn o wledge o f In digen o us scien ce, as well as the best o f leadin g edge Western scien ce. It’s high-tech meets high-TEK, an d in man y cases mo dern scien ce is affirmin g what the keen emp iricism o f First Peo p les has lo n g kn o wn . These are the o rigin al bio n eers. This is the sacred geo grap hy o f a wo rld where all life is revered an d an imated by sp irit. There is n o sep aratio n between the techn ical an d sp iritual. It’s a wo rld o f kin ship where all life is related. Its in structio n s seem so simp le: to be grateful—to p ractice reveren ce fo r co mmun ity an d creatio n —an d to en jo y life. The Origin al In structio n s remin d us that it’s n o t p eo p le who are smart. The real in telligen ce dwells thro ugho ut the n atural wo rld an d in the vast mystery o f the un iverse that’s beyo n d o ur human co mp rehen sio n . Humility is o ur co n stan t co mp an io n . The Origin al In structio n s celebrate o ur in terdep en den ce an d in terco n n ectio n with the diversity o f life an d o n e o ther. They help us remember who we are, that we were all In digen o us to a p lace n o t so man y gen eratio n s ago . They in vite us to re-in digen ize o urselves to o ur co mmo n ho me, Mo ther Earth. That is the keyho le we must slip thro ugh. It’s very small, an d we’ll have to make o urselves very small to p ass thro ugh it. In these p ages, yo u will hear the heartbeat o f p eo p le who se sp irits refused to be co n q uered in the murdero us face o f gen o cide. Peo p le who refused to fo rsake their culture an d values even thro ugh the trauma o f vio len t, racist co lo n izatio n . Peo p le who refused to clo se their hearts even when they were up again st un imagin able sufferin g, lo ss, an d disresp ect.

OVERVIEW OF GLOB A L IND IGENOUS PEOPLES A ND ISSUES There are at least 3 5 0 millio n p eo p le o n the Earth who iden tify themselves as In digen o us Peo p les.1 This is ap p ro ximately 6 – 8 p ercen t o f the wo rld p o p ulatio n . Acco rdin g to the last U.S. Cen sus Bureau rep o rts, there are 4 .1 millio n American In dian s livin g in the Un ited States. We make up 1 .5 p ercen t o f the to tal U.S. p o p ulatio n .2 We may be min o rities in terms o f p o p ulatio n , but we certain ly are n o t min o rities in terms o f kn o wledge, culture, an d diversity. As Native American law p ro fesso r David Wilkin s p uts it, “In dian p eo p les are n atio n s, n o t min o rities.”3 To day in the Un ited State alo n e there are o ver 5 5 0 Native American n atio n s sp eakin g o ver 1 7 5 distin ct lan guages. We have clearly demo n strated o ur p o wers o f survival an d adap tatio n . We have n o t van ished an d we are “back fro m extin ctio n ” as the San Fran cisco Bay Area-based Muwekma Ohlo n e assert.4 No t o n ly are In digen o us Peo p les reassertin g o ur p resen ce an d deman din g o ur rights, but we are “re-writin g histo ry an d re-rightin g histo ry” as Mao ri scho lar Lin da Tuhiwai Smith reco mmen ds in her bo o k D eco lo n izin g Metho do lo gies —Res ea r ch a n d In digen o us Peo p les .

I have do n e my best to main tain the feel an d dyn amic q uality o f the o ral traditio n in these edited talks while makin g them accessible an d stimulatin g fo r the gen eral reader. Yo u didn ’t have to “be there” to gain deep ly fro m the kn o wledge an d teachin gs shared in this bo o k. The wo rds an d sto ries sp eak fo r themselves. Sin ce mo st In digen o us cultures were, histo rically, o ral/aural cultures, mean in g that they relied o n vo ice, sp eech, sto ry, listen in g, an d memo ry rather than written text o n a p age fo r gain in g an d tran smittin g kn o wledge, In digen o us fo rms o f educatio n are usually based o n sto rytellin g. This dyn amic o ral traditio n —altho ugh severely threaten ed by waves o f co lo n ial disrup tio n , fo rced assimilatio n , an d cultural ho mo gen iz atio n —is bein g main tain ed an d resto red by p ersisten t lan guage keep ers an d culture bearers thro ugho ut the wo rld. As the late great Lako ta scho lar Vin e Delo ria Jr. has written , “Every human so ciety main tain s its sen se o f iden tity with a set o f sto ries that exp lain , at least to its satisfactio n , ho w thin gs came to be. A go o d man y so cieties begin at a creatio n an d carry fo rward a ten uo us lin k o f even ts which they co n sider to be histo rical—which is to say actual exp erien ces o f the gro up which o ften serve as p receden ts fo r determin in g p resen t an d future actio n s.”5 As the In lan d No rthwest Tribes o f America say, “sto ries make the wo rld.”6 Native sto ries in clude o rigin legen ds an d histo ry, famo us sp eeches an d ep ic p o ems, so n gs, the teachin gs o f sp irit men to rs, in structio n s fo r ceremo n y an d ritual, o bservatio n s o f wo rlds, an d sto reho uses o f ethn o - eco lo gical kn o wledge. Sto ries o ften live in man y dimen sio n s, with mean in gs that reach fro m the o rdin ary to the divin e, fro m the “befo re wo rlds” to the p resen t. Sto ries are p o ssessed with such p o wer that they have survived fo r gen eratio n s desp ite attemp ts at rep ressio n an d assimilatio n . Native American sto rytellin g is an in valuable cro ss-cultural co n tin uum that has n o begin n in g an d n o en d. All cultures can learn an d be en riched by Native sto rytellin g. Differen t “bun dles” o f sto ries rep resen t differen t asp ects o f life teachin gs: wo men ’s kn o wledge, healer’s kn o wledge, children ’s kn o wledge, hun ter’s kn o wledge, an d so o n . “In the In digen o us wo rld a ‘bun dle’ is made by the brin gin g to gether o f sp iritual an d material o bjects, elemen ts, allies an d en ergies that will be n eeded to sustain the sp iritual life an d secular o utco mes o f a ceremo n y o r gatherin g that is bein g un dertaken .”7 These teachin g bun dles are the “curriculum” fo r in digen o us educato rs. But teachin g bun dles are o n ly p art o f the sto ry. The o ther p art is the learn in g bun dles. In In digen o us p edago gy there is a great emp hasis o n learn in g. Chickasaw law p ro fesso r James Sakej Hen derso n o ften refers to the “learn in g sp irit” within each p erso n . He earn estly asks us, “Ho w do we awaken an d sustain the learn in g sp irit?” Put an o ther way, the emin en t Tewa In dian educato r Grego ry Cajete asks us to “ign ite the sp arkle” o f o ur o wn learn in g; fo llo w o ur p assio n an d listen to the deep er mean in gs within a sto ry o r watch fo r the hidden p attern that co n n ects seemin gly disp arate thin gs.8 Examin in g o ur o wn learn in g p ro cess req uires a self-in q uiry p ro cess to assess the stren gths an d weakn esses o f what Cajete calls the “ratio n al min d” an d the “metap ho ric min d.” He suggests that the metap ho ric min d is the first fo un datio n o f n ative scien ce.9 This In digen o us way o f learn in g thro ugh o bservin g an d listen in g to sto ries an d teachin gs an d reco gn iz in g an d valuin g o ur learn in g sp irits is q uite differen t fro m co n temp o rary fo rms o f main stream educatio n where an autho rity figure usually shares abstracted, so -called “o bjective” in fo rmatio n in a mo re lin ear, p edan tic way. In this bo o k, yo u will n o t n ecessarily fin d teachin gs laid o ut fo r yo u as 1 , 2 , 3 , o r A, B, C.

Human ity an d life o n this p lan et curren tly face an un p receden ted eco lo gical crisis. Climate chan ge, bio diversity extin ctio n , fo o d an d water scarcity, o verp o p ulatio n , the threat o f n uclear war, p o llutio n , an d to xicity . . . sadly, the list go es o n an d o n . Additio n ally, we face a greater so cial divide between the rich an d the p o o r, with fewer p eo p le co n tro llin g mo re p o wer an d reso urces. We live in a wo rld where a billio n p eo p le are starvin g to death, an d a billio n p eo p le are o bese. This eco n o mic disp arity co mbin ed with eco lo gical breakdo wn an d un reso lved so cial issues such as racism an d sexism fuels wars an d gen o cides an d p o ses serio us threats to the q uality an d co n tin ued existen ce o f life o n Earth, in cludin g o ur o wn sp ecies. Is this p ro cess o f eco lo gical an d so cial disin tegratio n a massive co llective mistake? Did human ity take a wro n g turn ? Do es human ity learn fro m its mistakes? Are we facin g an evo lutio n ary dead-en d? Or is this diso rder subsumed un der a larger o rder? Has the destructio n o f the earth been p ro p hesiz ed? Will the human sp ecies go extin ct? Part 1 addresses these weighty q uestio n s an d un co vers the eco lo gical an d sp iritual values o f the Origin al In structio n s. Deep within the teachin gs o f the Origin al In structio n s an d millen n ao ld o ral/verbal art fo rms are certain sto ry bun dles that serve as imp o rtan t warn in g sign s an d guidep o sts. These are o ften called p ro p hecies. They are an o ther typ e o f in structio n . There are co un tless examp les o f p ro p hetic traditio n s fro m all o f the wo rld’s cultures. Within In digen o us traditio n s there are n umero us sto ries ( reco rded an d un reco rded) regardin g the co n seq uen ces o f o ur decisio n s, co llective actio n s, an d the future o f human ity an d the earth. In discussin g p ro p hecy with my Lako ta/ Dako ta frien d an d co lleague Wo ablez a ( Ro bert LaBatte) , he co mmen ted, “It is my un derstan din g fro m my Elders that o n ce a p ro p hecy has been to ld it must n o t be chan ged an d that it has a co de o r sacred p ro cess embedded in the wo rds o r tran slatio n .” Un like man y classical Western an d Eastern p ro p hecies, In digen o us p ro p hecies do n o t n ecessarily revo lve aro un d a p ro p het. Maybe a p ro p het bro ught the teachin g, but the emp hasis is o n the message, an d the co llective tribal bo dy o r co mmun ity that ho lds that message, n o t the messen ger. Pro p hecies are a way to bo th remember an d lo o k fo rward. They o rally reco rd the even ts o f the p ast an d p ro vide lesso n s an d warn in g sign s fo r p o ten tial chan ges in the future. Pro p hecies do n o t p r edict the future but they o utlin e the p ro bable co n seq uen ces o f vio latin g n atural laws, o f n o t heedin g the Origin al In structio n s. In this bo o k, yo u will fin d several referen ces to p ro p hecies fro m man y differen t In digen o us traditio n s. The Ho p i o f the American So uthwest an d the Iro q uo is o f the American No rtheast are two tribal gro up s who have been actively sharin g their p ro p hecies with the wo rld. In 1 9 4 8 traditio n al Ho p i Elders selected Ho p i tribal member Tho mas Ban yacya to be the tran slato r an d messen ger fo r their Fo urth Wo rld p ro p hecy an d brin g their message to the wo rld, in cludin g the Un ited Natio n s. This p ro p hecy describes ho w we are curren tly livin g in the Fo urth Wo rld, after three p revio us wo rlds were destro yed by n atural disasters due to human s n o t listen in g to the Origin al In structio n s an d lettin g greed, selfishn ess, an d materialism do min ate. After decades o f tryin g to give the Ho p i message to the Un ited Natio n s, Ban yacya was fin ally able to fo rmally address the wo rld’s n atio n s in 1 9 9 2 ( Jo hn Mo hawk refers to this histo ric even t in chap ter 1 4 o f this bo o k) . Referrin g to the Creato r o n this histo ric o ccasio n , Ban yacya shared the Ho p i an cien t p ro p hecy with the Un ited Natio n s in tergo vern men tal p o litical bo dy. We made a sacred co ven an t to fo llo w his life p lan at all times, which in cludes the resp o n sibility o f takin g care o f this lan d an d life fo r his divin e p urp o se. We have n ever made treaties with an y fo reign n atio n , in cludin g the Un ited States, but fo r man y cen turies we have ho n o red this sacred agreemen t. Our go als are n o t to gain p o litical co n tro l, mo n etary wealth n o r military p o wer, but rather to p ray an d to p ro mo te the welfare o f all livin g bein gs an d to p reserve the wo rld in a n atural way.1 0 Ban yacya describes ho w an d why the p revio us three wo rlds p erished— the last o n e by a large flo o d—a co mmo n symbo l o f p urificatio n in man y cultures. He then states that a lin e run n in g aro un d the Ho p i ceremo n ial rattle rep resen ts Mo ther Earth. “The lin e is a time lin e an d in dicates that we are in the fin al days o f the p ro p hecy. What have yo u, as in dividuals, as n atio n s an d as the wo rld bo dy been do in g to take care o f this Earth?” He summariz es so me o f the serio us p ro blems o ccurrin g to day, fro m the p o iso n in g o f o ur fo o ds to starvin g children . He describes the warn in g sign s fro m n ature, such as beachin g whales. Ban yacya then stresses, “If we human s do n o t wake up to the warn in gs, the great p urificatio n will co me to destro y this wo rld just as the p revio us wo rlds were destro yed.” In a statemen t to human ity, 1 0 5 -year-o ld Ho p i Sn ake Priest Evehema echo ed the fo llo win g Ho p i warn in g: We are n o w faced with great p ro blems, n o t o n ly here but thro ugho ut the lan d. An cien t cultures are bein g an n ihilated. Our p eo p le’s lan ds are bein g taken fro m them. Why is this hap p en in g? It is hap p en in g because man y have given up o r man ip ulated their o rigin al sp iritual teachin gs. The way o f life that the Great Sp irit has given to all p eo p le o f the wo rld, whatever yo ur Origin al In structio n s, are n o t bein g ho n o red. It is because o f this great sickn ess called greed, which in fects every lan d an d co un try.1 1 The great Hauden o saun ee o r Six Natio n s Iro q uo is Co n federacy also has man y p ro p hecies regardin g the earth an d p eace. Over o n e tho usan d years ago their p ro p het, the Great Peacemaker, un ited warrin g tribes an d bro ught the Great Law o f Peace. This p ro fo un d p ro cess, histo rical even t, an d mo del is described in detail in chap ters 7 an d 8 by Jo hn Mo hawk an d Chief Oren Lyo n s resp ectively. Other In digen o us p ro p hecies discussed in o ral an d main stream literature, media, an d academia are the Mayan calen dar an d its p redictio n s fo r the year 2 0 1 2 ; the p ro p hecy o f the Eagle an d the Co n do r, which says that the In digen o us p eo p les o f No rth an d So uth America will be un ited in p eace; the Ko gi Warn in g fro m the Heart o f the Wo rld, an d n umero us o ther warn in g teachin gs fro m n atio n s, tribes, co mmun ities, an d in dividuals. I am n o t here to p ro mo te o r dismiss an y o f these as valid o r in valid but to p o in t to the fact that sto ry, p ro p hecy, an d o ral literature are so me o f the mo st imp o rtan t ways to tran smit cultural kn o wledge an d co llective memo ry. They serve as imp o rtan t to uchsto n es fo r human behavio r, ethics, an d lifeways. They help us reassess o ur relatio n ship to time an d to p lace, an d remin d us to ask o urselves, “What have we, as in dividuals, as n atio n s, an d as the wo rld bo dy, been do in g to take care o f this earth?” A D D RESSING THE EC OLOGIC A L IND IA N A ND ROMA NC ING THE STONE A GE As the late Western Sho sho n e sp iritual leader Co rbin Harn ey used to say, “n ative p eo p le are n o t sep arate fro m the en viro n men t. We a r e the en viro n men t! ” With every bite o f fo o d we eat, every dro p o f water we drin k, every breath o f air we in hale, we are o n the fluid edge o f “in side” an d “o utside,” “me” an d the “en viro n men t,” the p erso n an d the p lan et, an d the in dividual an d human ity. As the late p hysicist an d p hilo so p her David Bo hm has said, “The co n scio usn ess o f human ity man ifests in each in dividual, each in dividual man ifests the co n scio usn ess o f human kin d.”*5 In this sen se, o ur bio lo gical an d p sycho lo gical sp ace is a co mmun al gro un d, a co mmo n s. As much as human tho ught an d Euro cen tric co n ditio n in g tries to divide an d fragmen t us, we are ultimately p art o f an un divided who len ess. With this p ro fo un d p hilo so p hical an d ethical un derstan din g, In digen o us Peo p les have taken it up o n themselves to be the caretakers o f the last remain in g healthy, sacred, bio diverse p laces o n earth because they are us, we can n o t be sep arated fro m these p laces.

This p ro fo un d in ter- relatio n ship o f n ature an d culture is further elabo rated in p art 3 , “The Art an d Scien ce o f Kin ship .” Due to imp o sed eco n o mic an d co lo n ial regimes, man y n ative lan ds have been min ed, bo mbed, strip p ed, defo rested, an d p o lluted with the wo rst chemicals an d to xic waste kn o wn to human ity.

Part 6 o f this bo o k, “Deco lo n iz atio n an d Glo bal In digen o us Struggles fo r Justice,” directly addresses the n ative resistan ce to min in g an d to xic co lo n ialism o f In digen o us lan ds an d p eo p les. Man y Native Peo p les believe that the cen ter o f the un iverse o r the heart o f the wo rld is in their backyard, literally. An d there is n o co n flict o ver this as the Win tu o f Califo rn ia can p erceive Mo un t Shasta in n o rthern Califo rn ia as the cen ter o f their un iverse while the Ko gi o f Co lo mbia can un derstan d that they are fro m the “heart o f the wo rld” in the Sierra Nevada de San ta Marta o f Co lo mbia. Place-based sp iritual resp o n sibility an d co gn itive p luralism are imbedded in mo st Origin al Teachin gs. It is go o d that each n atio n , each tribe, each co mmun ity p erceives their an cestral lan ds as the cen ter o f the un iverse, as their ho ly lan d, as Leslie Gray’s chap ter 1 1 p ro vo catively discusses. It is when p eo p le thin k there is o n ly “o n e p lace” that is ho ly o r o n ly “o n e way” that is right that hegemo n y rears its ugly head an d so cieties get in to tro uble with co n flict an d war. All cultures have this challen ge an d In digen o us Peo p les have go n e to war with each o ther sin ce the begin n in g. Man y In digen o us gro up s, such as the Ho p i, Iro q uo is, an d Tibetan s, have a p ro fo un d co mmitmen t to p eace an d live their lives with the least amo un t o f co n flict as p o ssible. Yet o ther tribes an d gro up s have had man y wars with their n eighbo rs. Fo r examp le, my o wn tribe, the Ojibwe, have been traditio n al en emies with the Lako ta o r Sio ux n atio n an d bo th n atio n s remember man y brutal battles with each o ther. In tertribal co n flicts an d allian ces have existed sin ce befo re co n tact with Euro p ean p o wers an d certain ly co n tin ued afterward. It is imp o rtan t to n o te that man y o f these histo rical in tertribal co n flicts were also a result o f o r escalated by the U.S. go vern men t’s military strategy o f “divide an d co n q uer” to p reven t in tertribal allian ces that p resen ted mo re o f a threat to the Un ited States. These histo ries o f co n flict an d war n o t o n ly divide tribes but actually co n n ect them in man y deep ways. The Ojibwe an d Lako ta, fo r examp le, o ften tease each o ther abo ut these o ld co n fro n tatio n s but do so with great mutual resp ect regardin g their en twin ed histo ry. As the o ld sayin g go es, “keep yo ur frien ds clo se an d yo ur en emies clo ser.” Man y tribes learn ed, shared, an d co evo lved with each o ther thro ugh co mp lex rituals an d cycles o f traditio n al warfare an d p eace. Native Peo p les, like all p eo p les, strive fo r p o sitive an d p eaceful lives yet so metimes fin d themselves amidst co n flict an d war. It o ften en ds up bein g a p ro fo un d p erso n al ethical q uestio n , bo th histo rically an d fo r to day, abo ut the best way to deal with co n flict. Man y tribes an d n ative in dividuals are co mmitted to n o n vio len t, p eaceful resp o n ses while o thers feel it is so metimes n ecessary to take up arms. Part 2 o n “In digen o us Demo cracies” lo o ks directly at this q uestio n an d p ro vides fo ur differen t In digen o us gro up s’ p ersp ectives regardin g co llective decisio n -makin g, so cial o rgan iz atio n , co n flict reso lutio n , an d p eacemakin g. In digen o us Peo p les have millen n ia-o ld In digen o us Kn o wledge Systems ( IKS) that are tribally an d geo grap hically sp ecific. Within these kn o wledge systems o r teachin g bun dles o f In digen o us Kn o wledge is Traditio n al Eco lo gical Kn o wledge ( TEK) . This “TEK” o r n ative scien ce ho lds the memo ries, o bservatio n s, sto ries, un derstan din gs, in sights, an d p ractices fo r ho w to fo llo w the n atural laws o f a p articular p lace. TEK is o ften en co ded in the sto ries an d so n gs o f the o ral traditio n an d within p articular rituals an d daily p ractices. The Co ast Miwo k o f Marin an d So n o ma Co un ties in n o rthern Califo rn ia ho ld the traditio n al kn o wledge fo r ho w to live in dyn amic eq uilibrium with the o ak wo o dlan ds, redwo o d fo rests, grasslan ds, creeks, wetlan ds, an d co astal p rairies o f their rich lan dscap e.

Kn o win g, rememberin g, p racticin g, an d imp lemen tin g these p lace– based n ative scien ces an d laws co mes with a great resp o n sibility. Greg Cajete has called this a p ractice o f sacred eco lo gy o r sacred scien ce. It is n o t fo r everyo n e. Un fo rtun ately, much o f this kn o wledge an d its asso ciated p ractices were systematically erased, taken away, an d fo rbidden by co lo n ial p o wers. Man y fluen t lan guage keep ers an d Elders still ho ld this kn o wledge. To day, tho se o f us who are yo un ger an d o f mixed-blo o d heritage are do in g man y thin gs to reco ver an d resto re these essen tial ethics an d p ractices o f sustain ability in a mo dern co n text. Because o f these diverse kn o wledge systems an d teachin g bun dles within In digen o us co mmun ities, there has been much debate an d discussio n abo ut the stereo typ e o f the “eco lo gically n o ble savage,” as well as co n cern s o ver a ro man ticiz atio n o f the p ast. What is in terestin g is that these q uestio n s do n o t o ften co n cern In digen o us Peo p les themselves. The issues o f ro man ticiz atio n an d exo tificatio n seem to be mo re o f a co n cern an d p ractice fro m o utside, fro m Euro -American academia an d the New Age mo vemen t resp ectively. Certain ly Native Peo p les are co n cern ed an d up set when they are stereo typ ed an d ro man ticiz ed; this fo rm o f racism n eeds to chan ge. But the q uestio n o f whether In digen o us Peo p les were, histo rically, en viro n men talists o r n o t, is almo st irrelevan t. To say that American In dian s were the “first eco lo gists” fragmen ts en viro n men tal matters fro m o ther issues o f daily life an d imp o ses a mo dern p o stco lo n ial co n cep t o n to a histo rical, p reco lo n ial co n text. On o n e han d, given the rich p hilo so p hical wo rldviews an d life p ractices o f lan d an d kin , it is absurd fo r In digen o us Peo p les ( o r o thers) to q uestio n whether they were o r are en viro n men talists o r n o t. Den n is Martin ez an d En riq ue Salmó n address this issue in chap ter 1 2 by p o in tin g o ut that TEK is first an d fo remo st p r a ctica l kn o wledge fo r survival, n o t so me mystical train in g fo r tran scen den ce. Just the fact that so man y In digen o us Peo p les are still here in dicates they have p ro fo un d eco lo gical kn o wledge an d skills o f survival an d adap tatio n . As So uthern Paiute elder Vivien n e Jake says, “Whether we kn o w it o r n o t, there co uld co me a time when we have to go thro ugh hardship again , an d the Paiute survival arts are what is go in g to save my p eo p le, as lo n g as we kn o w what tho se survival arts are an d ho w to live thro ugh hardship .”1 2 On the o ther han d, man y In digen o us gro up s, tribes, an d villages made an d make eco lo gical mistakes, whether it’s lettin g a p rescribed fire get o ut o f han d, o verharvestin g an an imal, o r mo re recen tly, allo win g to xic waste o n their lan ds. Additio n ally, due to the trauma o f co lo n iz atio n , assimilatio n , an d extreme p o verty amid a cap italistic lan dscap e, man y Native Peo p les have beco me “American iz ed” with the same materialism an d greed as an y o n e else an d have been co n ditio n ed to fo rget the earth an d o ur n o n human relatives. The fact that man y Native American tribal co un cils are p rio ritiz in g casin o s, go lf co urses, an d reso rts o ver traditio n al agriculture, sustain able lan d use, an d cultural cen ters makes this p o in t. In digen o us Peo p les, like all p eo p les, are far fro m p erfect an d make mistakes. An d yes, n ative gro up s have histo rically made eco lo gical mistakes; that is n atural. Yet the q uestio n then beco mes, ho w do we learn fro m these mistakes? Embedded within mo st In digen o us Kn o wledge systems, lan guages, an d wo rldviews are p ro fo un d teachin gs fo r an en tirely differen t reality o f o ur relatio n ship to the lan d, water, an d o ther elemen ts o f the earth an d un iverse. These teachin gs are based o n lo n g-held cultural memo ries that reco un t histo ric mistakes to remin d us n o t to make them again . These mistakes have been tran sfo rmed in to lesso n s in culcated in to In digen o us cultures an d sp iritual teachin gs. The Origin al In structio n s p ro vide a fo rm o f mo ral checks an d balan ces o n the co llective co n scio usn ess o f a p eo p le. Ho w well we listen to these memo ries an d in structio n s will determin e o ur future. Because lo cal TEK is so fo reign to the min dset o f mo dern , western scien ce an d the Euro cen tric p aradigm, it is o ften difficult fo r n o n n ative o utsiders to un derstan d these realities an d teachin gs. As Edward Said, the late Palestin ian -American scho lar an d writer articulated so well ( an d man y o thers have said sin ce) , when p eo p le do n o t un derstan d thin gs, it is easy to den igrate, ro man ticiz e, o r exo ticiz e differen t ways an d p eo p les—to dehuman iz e the “Other.” C ULTURA L REC OVERY A ND REVITA LIZING IND IGENOUS LIFEWA YS Fo r man y o f us, the p ro cess o f re-in digen iz atio n mean s we have to deco lo n iz e o ur min ds, hearts, bo dies, an d sp irits an d revitaliz e healthy cultural traditio n s. We also have to create n ew traditio n s, n ew ways to thrive in this co mp lex wo rld durin g these in ten se times. As Jo hn Mo hawk states in chap ter 2 8 o f this bo o k, “We’re in reco very fro m the effects o f mo re than five cen turies o f what o n ly can be described as cultural madn ess.” After sufferin g fro m co n q uest an d survivin g attemp ted gen o cide, man y In digen o us Peo p les are affected by what Ojibwe scho lar Lawren ce Gro ss calls, “Po st-Ap o calyp tic Stress Diso rder.”1 3 Gro ss go es o n to defin e his mean in g by sayin g that to day’s Native Peo p les are in a “p o st- ap o calyp tic” time because after co n q uest o ur wo rlds came to an en d. He then argues that “altho ugh the traditio n al wo rld o f the An ishin aabe ( o r an y tribe) may have co me to an en d, the wo rldview that in fo rmed that life still survives.”1 4 To day’s Native American s are descen dan ts o f survivo rs o f a ho lo caust. “The histo rical lo sses o f Native p eo p les meet the Un ited Natio n s defin itio n o f gen o cide.”1 5 Gen o cide, fo reign disease, an d co lo n ial vio len ce have affected every asp ect o f In dian life. “A vio latio n o f this n ature o ccurs at the p hysical, p sycho lo gical an d sp iritual levels an d therefo re, the issue must be addressed at all o f these levels. Healin g o f the bo dy, min d an d sp irit is further co mp o un ded by the fact that the trauma o ccurs at the p erso n al, co mmun ity an d co llective level.”1 6 Histo rical trauma is a result o f go vern men tal p o licies o f gen o cide, remo val an d relo catio n , assimilatio n an d termin atio n that have affected Native American s fo r five hun dred years. Such extreme exp erien ces o f vio len ce, cultural disrup tio n , fo rced assimilatio n thro ugh missio n an d bo ardin g scho o ls an d o ther mean s, an d eco n o mic margin aliz atio n an d p o verty has created a systemic p ro blem o f p sycho lo gical disemp o wermen t an d trauma fo r American In dian s. So cially un ackn o wledged an d in dividually un treated, these traumas are in herited in tergen eratio n ally. “Perso n al traumas lead to co llective traumatiz atio n , an d in turn , co llective traumatiz atio n ( o p p ressio n , rep ressio n , etc.) imp acts p erso n al trauma.”1 7 This trauma man ifests as in tern aliz ed o p p ressio n that p erp etuates a n egative cycle o f men tal health diso rders within n ative in dividuals, families, an d the co mmun ity at large. This n egative cycle is directly related to the ho rrific statistics that sho w that Native American s are disp ro p o rtio n ately rep resen ted in high rates o f suicide, in carceratio n , an d death ro w sen ten cin g. In tern aliz ed o p p ressio n is a result o f the so cio eco n o mic an d p sycho sp iritual do min atio n o f o p p ressive p o litical systems that seeks to co lo n iz e an d co n tro l culturally diverse p eo p les ( their kn o wledge an d p ractices) , usually fo r eco n o mic labo r an d religio us co n versio n . The p o litical structures o f o p p ressio n —racism, p o verty, sexism, vio len ce, acculturatio n stress—beco me so do min an t in the min ds o f the o p p ressed p eo p les that they begin to believe these do min an t n arratives an d in tern aliz e this o p p ressio n . As the well-kn o wn So uth African so cial justice activist Steven Biko stated, “the mo st p o ten t weap o n in the han ds o f the o p p resso r is the min d o f the o p p ressed.” Man y diverse thin kers, writers, an d n ative Elders have asserted that the co llective co n scio usn ess o f Native American co mmun ities an d o f the do min an t American so ciety will be n o t be at p eace un til mo dern American s ackn o wledge the p ast treatmen t o f American In dian s an d the fact that this co un try was built o n gen o cide an d slavery. There must be an ackn o wledgmen t o f the truth, an ap o lo gy, a reco n ciliatio n , restitutio n , an d a healin g. The health o f American In dian s is directly tied to the histo rical, so cial co n text o f America. In man y ways, fo r American In dian s, p o litical justice an d p sycho lo gical healin g are co n n ected. It is n ative wo men who are o ften at the fo refro n t o f makin g these lin ks an d leadin g cuttin g-edge mo vemen ts. We hear fro m p o werful n ative wo men thro ugho ut this bo o k an d dedicate p art 4 to “In digen o us Femin in e Po wer: In Ho n o r o f Sky Wo man .” To day, this legacy o f p ain is bein g addressed thro ugh the Native American welln ess mo vemen t, traditio n al an d in tegrative medicin e, a ren ewal o f n ative p ractices such as traditio n al fo o ds an d ceremo n ies, an d thro ugh co n temp o rary arts an d media.

Fo r examp le, the n ative fo o ds revitaliz atio n mo vemen t is flo urishin g in No rth America; p art 5 , “Yo u Are Where Yo u Eat: Native Fo o ds an d Traditio n al Agriculture,” shares heartbreakin g sto ries o f lo ss o f fo o ds an d well-bein g but also p ro vides excellen t mo dels an d case studies o f n ative co mmun ities resto rin g their stren gth thro ugh the ren ewal o f In digen o us fo o ds an d medicin es. ID ENTITY A ND IND IGENEITY Natives an d n o n n atives alike o ften ask, “Who is a real In dian ?” Full- blo o ds, mixed-blo o ds, members o f a federally reco gn iz ed tribes, tho se who sp eak their lan guage, tho se who live o n their reservatio n s, tho se who “lo o k” In dian —are thes e real In dian s? They are certain ly so me o f the stereo typ es o f In dian authen ticity. Native American cultural p sycho lo gist Jo sep h Go n e has p o in ted o ut that due to in tern aliz ed o p p ressio n an d o ther issues, man y In dian p eo p le suffer fro m the “Mo re In dian Than Tho u” ( MITT) syn dro me. This is a subtle an d o ften n o t so subtle measurin g up o f who is an authen tic In dian p erso n . Mixed-raced p eo p le like myself, an d like mo st o f us these days, are o ften to ld, “yo u do n ’t lo o k In dian ,” o r “yo u must be a half-breed.” As Paula Gun n Allen suggests, mixed-race p eo p le are n o t “half an d half” but “all an d all.” The q uestio n s o f who is In digen o us in the twen ty-first cen tury an d what is in digen eity are critical q uestio n s o f o ur time. This bo o k, p articularly the last sectio n o n “Re-In digen iz atio n ,” help s elucidate these co n cep ts an d shares imp o rtan t resp o n ses. Ultimately, as man y o f these co n tributo rs describe, we must heal the relatio n ship between the co lo n iz er an d the co lo n iz ed, startin g within o urselves. On ly then can we be authen tic human bein gs who will be able to co n tribute p o sitively to a mo re just, co mp assio n ate, an d sustain able wo rld fo r In digen o us Peo p les an d a ll p eo p les, in cludin g o ur win ged, fo ur-legged, an d fin n ed relatives in the n atural wo rld.

PART O N E Un co verin g the Eco -Sp iritual Values o f the Origin al In structio n s 1 Li ste n i n g to Na tura l La w Chief Oren Lyons Neya wenha S ka nnoh. It mean s “Than k yo u fo r bein g well.” The greetin g in itself is so methin g o f an idea o f ho w In dian p eo p le thin k an d ho w their co mmun ities o p erate. What hap p en s to yo u an d what hap p en s to the earth hap p en s to us as well, so we have, as I said befo re, co mmo n in terests. We have to so meho w try to co n vin ce p eo p le who are in p o wer to chan ge the directio n that they’ve been takin g. We n eed to take a mo re resp o n sible directio n an d to begin dealin g with the realities o f the future to in sure that there is a future fo r the children , fo r the n atio n . That’s what we’re abo ut. It is to o ur advan tage as well as yo urs to be do in g that. In the co n cern an d in the fights that we face as a co mmo n p eo p le, as human bein gs, as a sp ecies, we have to get to gether an d we have to do thin gs like we’re do in g n o w—meetin g, sharin g, learn in g. It all co mes do wn to the will, what is in yo ur heart. In dian p eo p le have survived up to this time because we have a stro n g will. We do n o t agree that we sho uld be assimilated. We do n o t agree that we sho uld give up o ur way o f life. An d that same will sho uld be in yo ur heart—the will that yo u do n o t agree that there be n o future. I do n ’t believe, p erso n ally, that we have reached a p o in t o f n o return in this situatio n that we’re in , but we are ap p ro achin g it. The farther yo u’re away fro m a p o in t o f n o return , the mo re o p tio n s yo u have. As we mo ve each day clo ser to a p o in t o f n o return , we lo se that day’s o p tio n . An d there will co me a p o in t where we wo n ’t have an o p tio n . There will be n o mo re o p tio n s. At that p o in t, p eo p le will cry an d p eo p le will carry o n an d so fo rth. But as Chief Shen an do ah said to me, “I do n ’t kn o w what the big p ro blem is. It’s to o late an yway.” I said, “Un cle, what do yo u mean by that?” “Well,” he says, “they’ve do n e a lo t o f damage. They’re go in g to suffer.” Kin d o f a simp le o bservatio n , but true en o ugh. There is a lo t o f damage do n e an d p eo p le are go in g to suffer but he didn ’t carry o ut the tho ught that we were to ld a lo n g time ago in the p ro p hecies; the p ro p hecies that said there was go in g to be a degradatio n o f the earth. We were to ld that yo u co uld tell the exten t o f the degradatio n o f the earth because there wo uld be two very imp o rtan t systems to warn yo u. On e wo uld be the acceleratio n o f the win ds. We were to ld that the win ds wo uld accelerate an d co n tin ue to accelerate. When yo u see that the acceleratio n o f the win ds are gro win g, then yo u are in dan gero us times. They said the o ther way to tell that the earth was in degradatio n was ho w p eo p le treated their children . They said it will be very imp o rtan t to n o te ho w p eo p le treat their children , an d that will tell yo u ho w the earth is degradin g. So when yo u o p en up the n ewsp ap ers to day they talk abo ut exp lo itive sex an d children , they talk abo ut ho meless children , an d yo u can co un t ho meless children by the millio n s. To us, it’s a severe in dicatio n o f the degradatio n . So ciety do esn ’t care. So we have to take tho se sign p o sts serio usly an d begin to o rgan ize o urselves an d do the best we can . We must gather o urselves to gether, give o urselves so me mo ral sup p o rt, en o ugh to go ho me an d start o ver an d do it again , because everythin g starts at ho me. It starts right there with yo u. It starts with yo u an d then yo ur family. Then fro m yo ur family it go es o ut an d that’s ho w yo u do it, that’s ho w yo u have to do it. It’s grassro o ts. Yo u go back an d yo u begin to in fo rm an d yo u get a little mo re excited an d yo u get a little mo re severe in yo ur p o sitio n s an d yo u begin to in sist that p eo p le hear an d listen . There’s a lo t o f in fo rmatio n an d that’s o n e o f the go o d thin gs abo ut this Bio n eers co alitio n that co mes to gether. There’s a lo t o f exchan ge an d sup p o rt an d imp o rtan t in fo rmatio n co n veyed. Educatio n is imp o rtan t an d ho w yo u educate p eo p le as to what we n eed is fun damen tally imp o rtan t. The sp iritual side o f the n atural wo rld is abso lute. The laws are abso lute. Our in structio n s, an d I’m talkin g abo ut fo r all human bein gs, o ur in structio n s are to get alo n g. Un derstan d what these laws are. Get alo n g with laws, an d sup p o rt them an d wo rk with them. We were to ld a lo n g time ago that if yo u do that, life is en dless. It just co n tin ues o n an d o n in great cycles o f regen eratio n , great p o werful cycles o f life regen eratin g an d regen eratin g an d regen eratin g. If yo u wan t to tin ker with that regen eratio n , if yo u wan t to in terrup t it, that’s yo ur cho ice, but the results that co me back can be very severe because again , the laws are abso lute. There’s n o habeas co rp us in n atural law. Yo u either do o r yo u do n ’t. If yo u do n ’t, yo u p ay. It’s q uite simp le. So what we have to do is get o ur leaders to chan ge, an d if o ur leaders do n ’t do it we’ve go t to raise better leaders, n ewer leaders. Raise yo ur o wn leaders. Get them up there. It’s yo ur resp o n sibility to raise go o d leaders. Get them up there where they can be effective an d chan ge the directio n o f the way thin gs are headed. I co me fro m On o n daga an d fro m o ur co un try I remember when everybo dy p lan ted. I sto o d behin d o n e o f tho se p lo ws that yo u ho o ked behin d a ho rse. An d at my age, if yo u hit a ro ck, yo u flew right o ver the p lo w han dle. It was hard to ho ld that p lo w. I remember that. It was hard wo rk. Plan tin g an d agriculture is hard wo rk. Yo u have to get up early. Yo u’ve go t to do stuff, but it’s great train in g fo r character. It’s great train in g fo r beco min g adult an d beco min g resp o n sible, the best train in g, really. But gettin g back to agriculture is hard to do these days. There will co me a time, ho wever, when o n ly tho se that kn o w ho w to p lan t will be eatin g. That’s n o t far o ff. So all o f tho se In dian Natio n s that built who le civilizatio n s aro un d fo o d an d aro un d than ksgivin g an d aro un d sp iritual law, tho se In dian n atio n s have to resurge an d have to remin d o n e an o ther ho w imp o rtan t that is. All co mmun ities talk abo ut p rayer. We just do n ’t call it p rayer but we do it all the time. We sin g so n gs, dawn so n gs, mo rn in g ceremo n ies, than ksgivin g-co min g-up -so o n so n gs. Than ksgivin g all summer, all sp rin g. All o f o ur ceremo n ies are than ksgivin g. We have than ksgivin g twelve mo n ths a year. In the sp rin g when the sap run s thro ugh the trees we have ceremo n ies, than ksgivin g. Fo r the map le, chief o f the trees, leader o f all the trees, than ksgivin g. Than ksgivin g fo r all the trees. Plan tin g than ksgivin g. Than ksgivin g fo r the strawberries, first fruit. Than ksgivin g fo r the bees, the co rn , green co rn , than ksgivin g. Harvest than ksgivin g. Co mmun ity, p ro cess, chiefs, clan mo thers, everybo dy is there. Families are there. Ho w do yo u in sp ire resp ect fo r so methin g? By givin g than ks, by do in g it. We have to do that. We have to be than kful. That’s what we said. Two thin gs were to ld to us: to be than kful, so tho se are o ur ceremo n ies, ceremo n ies o f than ksgivin g. We built n atio n s aro un d it, an d yo u can do that, to o . An d the o ther thin g they said was en jo y life. That’s a rule, a law— en jo y life—yo u’re sup p o sed to . I kn o w yo u can o n ly do as much as yo u can do an d then when yo u do that, yo u’re sup p o sed to get o utside an d en jo y life. Do n ’t take yo urself so serio usly. Do the best yo u can but get at it. That’s the way yo u an d I have co mmun ity. I’ll be do wn in the mo uth an d be mo p in g an d draggin g aro un d but by meetin g with p eo p le an d sittin g an d talkin g an d listen in g to all o f the p o sitive en ergy an d the in ten tio n s at Bio n eers, fo r in stan ce, an d o ther gatherin gs, it’s ren ewable.

That’s the way it is an d that’s what it’s go in g to take. Hard wo rk will do an ythin g. It used to be co mmo n , co mmo n law. So I wo uld say that in the ideas o f ren ewin g yo urself an d the ideas o f fin din g p eace in o ur co mmun ity, yo u sho uld tell yo ur leaders an d yo u sho uld tell everybo dy that there can n ever be wo rld p eace as lo n g as yo u make war again st Mo ther Earth. To make war again st Mo ther Earth is to destro y an d to co rrup t, to kill, to p o iso n . When we do that, we will n o t have p eace. The first p eace co mes with yo ur mo ther, Mo ther Earth. Da hna yto ( No w I am fin ished) . This p resen tatio n to o k p lace at the Bio n eers Co n feren ce in 1 9 9 6 . 2 First Na tions Surviva l a nd the Future of the Ea rth Reb ecca A da mson My mo m p assed away several years ago . In the traditio n al Chero kee way o f p aren tin g, yo u didn ’t n ecessarily tell yo ur child what to do but yo u guided. On e o f the key thin gs my mo m used to say o ver an d o ver to me, p articularly durin g my ado lescen t years was, “Rebecca Lee, if yo u do n ’t chan ge directio n s, yo u’re go in g to en d up where yo u’re headed.” Okay, Mo m. We have go t to chan ge directio n s. It’s crucial to un derstan d that, as a so ciety, we can reo rgan iz e. We can reo rgan iz e so cially, p o litically, an d eco n o mically, an d we can reo rgan iz e acco rdin g to o ur values. Just within my o wn heritage, within the Chero kee Natio n , we always had a white co un cil, which was the wo men ’s co un cil, which ruled durin g times o f p eace. An d then we had a red co un cil, which was the men ’s co un cil, which ruled durin g times o f war. The go al was the balan ce, the harmo n y, the brin gin g to gether o f bo th wisdo ms an d bo th en ergies fo r the go o d o f the Natio n . We abso lutely have to begin that jo urn ey o n a gran d scale because we are run n in g o ut o f time. I’d like to share with yo u several sto ries startin g with o n e abo ut the San p eo p le in Bo tswan a an d Namibia, in So uth Africa. I’m sure man y p eo p le have seen The Gods Must B e Cra zy. It’s an in credibly p o p ular film. If yo u listen to that film, yo u hear the mo st amaz in g lan guage. Yo u hear p o p s an d clicks, an d there is a vo ice-o ver o ver a lo t o f it. But when yo u hear a stran ge lan guage bein g sp o ken in the film, that is the San p eo p le. Up un til 1 9 6 3 , it used to be legal to hun t the San p eo p le. Yo u co uld go to the go vern men t in Bo tswan a an d Namibia an d get a hun tin g p ermit an d hun t them do wn as if they were tro p hy an imals. We began wo rkin g with them in 1 9 9 7 . We met with them in the Kalahari Desert, which was essen tially the very last o f their an cestral territo ries. They had been driven an d driven in to what was o n e o f harshest en viro n men ts imagin able an d yet they had adap ted an d were survivin g. While we were there, they were n o tified by the go vern men t o f Bo tswan a that they were go in g to be remo ved at the en d o f the rain y seaso n , an d o n ce again disp laced fro m n o w what was the remain in g little bit o f their territo rial lan ds. We sat that n ight un der a full mo o n an d by a camp fire, an d in their gen ero sity o f sp irit they gifted us with a tran ce dan ce. A tran ce dan ce is a very an cien t callin g fo r guidan ce an d un derstan din g an d a un iversal fo rm o f what was to take p lace. As I listen ed to that dan ce an d I listen ed to the sin gin gs, I listen ed to the lan guage, I clo sed my eyes, an d I’d hear the sn ap o f twigs. I’d hear the crack o f bran ches. I’d hear the rustle o f grasses. I’d hear the win d, the whirrin g, as a bird takes flight. I realiz ed what I was hearin g were the so un ds o f n ature, that these p eo p le were a p art o f the sacred creatio n in every exp ressio n o f their life. Readin g later, I disco vered that—by mo st an thro p o lo gical acco un ts—this was the mo st an cien t lan guage kn o wn to human kin d. Ho w else wo uld we have learn ed to sp eak if it wasn ’t thro ugh the sheer imitatio n o f n ature ? But what’s hap p en in g to the San s p eo p le is hap p en in g to In digen o us Peo p les thro ugho ut the wo rld. As In digen o us Peo p les, we are three hun dred to fo ur hun dred millio n p eo p le an d we co ver o ver seven ty co un tries. We truly are the glo baliz atio n issue with face, heart, feelin gs, an d so ul. What defin es an In digen o us p erso n is the fact that we p redate an y o ther gro up s in o ur territo ries. But also eq ually imp o rtan t is o ur sp iritual lin k to the lan d, o ur co n n ectio n that is deep ly embedded with who we are in un derstan din g an d in relatin g to the lan d. The n ext p o in t I wan t to share is that glo bally an d geo grap hically, In digen o us Peo p les’ territo ries an d critical habitats o verlap . Alaska wo uld be a classic examp le o f the critical habitat sto ry as it un fo lds fo r In digen o us Peo p les in No rth America. They have arbo real fo rests an d the majo r wetlan ds. I wen t up there in 1 9 9 2 o n a fact-fin din g missio n because, at the time, Go vern o r Hin kle had p ut a ban o n the fishin g o f chum salmo n . There are n o gro cery sto res in mo st Alaskan villages. Yo u basically live o ff what yo u gather, hun t, o r fish. So the go vern o r’s actio n s were basically a death sen ten ce to man y o f the village p eo p le an d, q uite simp ly, it mean t they wo uld starve. We wen t to n in eteen differen t villages, startin g with Po rt Graham in the so uthern p art where yo u fin d the mo uth o f the Yuko n River. We were travelin g up the Yuko n . At Po rt Graham, they had already lo st their sealin g because o f the Valdez o il sp ill back in 1 9 8 9 . We all remember that o n e, with eleven millio n gallo n s o f o il abso lutely destro yin g the marin e eco system. They n o lo n ger co uld hun t caribo u. They n o lo n ger co uld hun t mo o se, n o lo n ger hun t mo un tain go at. An d in o n e sin gle year, sp o rts hun ters had killed every sin gle bear in that territo ry, takin g the p aws an d the heads ho me as tro p hies. Two bears will carry a village thro ugh the win ter. No w the In digen o us Peo p les there were bein g to ld they co uld n o lo n ger fish chum salmo n . As the sto ry un fo lded, we wen t to the co mmun ity meetin g ho use fo r din n er, an d I was clearly wo n derin g what we were go in g to eat at this p o in t. As we walked in , there were tables full o f cassero le dishes. I asked the p eo p le, Well, what do yo u eat? An d they said, do g fo o d. It was essen tially the bo tto m fish that they had always fed their sleddin g do gs. We had it barbecued, we had it dried, we had it ro asted, we had it in cassero les. But with a tremen do us gen ero sity o f sp irit, the p eo p le o f Po rt Graham shared every bit o f the fo o d they had at that gatherin g. On e o f the p o in ts I’d like to make with Alaska tho ugh is that as far as the salmo n fishin g go es, within the State’s harvest, it’s o n ly 3 p ercen t o f the take. So 9 7 p ercen t o f the salmo n take really is do n e by co mmercial an d sp o rts fishin g in what is a very fragile an d delicate eco system. An o ther majo r o verlap is between In digen o us territo ries an d the wo rld’s bio diversity ho t sp o ts. Yo u can see this clearly o n a map . Yo u n eed to un derstan d that ho wever n atural it ap p ears in tho se bio diversity ho t sp o ts, abso lutely n o territo rial eco system o utside o f the An tarctic has escap ed In digen o us Peo p les’ bio -en gin eerin g. Exten sive kn o wledge o f the medicin al p ro p erties o f p lan ts, fun gi, an d even in sects within their territo ries has p ro vided a so rt o f p harmaco p o eia fo r In digen o us Peo p les aro un d the wo rld. Man y o f the early syn thetic drugs such as q uin in e an d asp irin were derived fro m In digen o us Kn o wledge, an d to day, this traditio n al kn o wledge is o n e o f the p rin cip le so urces fo r iden tifyin g n ew mo lecules an d gen es in the rap idly gro win g p harmaceutical an d gen etic en gin eerin g in dustries. The co vert acq uisitio n an d co mmercial marketin g o f this kn o wledge, an d we call it bio -p iracy, is un dertaken by all kin ds o f differen t gro up s an d in stitutio n s, fro m o bscure un iversity research dep artmen ts to multin atio n al p harmaceutical co rp o ratio n s. On ce p aten ted an d trademarked, the kn o wledge is effectively exp ro p riated fro m In digen o us Peo p les. A clear examp le o f this is the fact that the Win n ebago tribe can n o t even use their tribal iden tity in marketin g an y co mmercial p ro ducts because it’s trademarked by the Win n ebago trailers.*6 On ce it en ters the trademark system, it is co mp letely exp ro p riated. Also o ccurrin g thro ugho ut these bio diverse regio n s, esp ecially in Asia an d Latin America, is the in dustrializ atio n o f farmin g. Un der this “Green Revo lutio n ,” large tracts o f lan d are o p en ed up fo r co mmercial p lan tatio n s. The go al o f exp an ded fo o d p ro ductio n is used to justify the who lesale disp lacemen t o f In digen o us Peo p les. This is rep o rted at the very ro o t o f ethn ic clean sin g takin g p lace in Guatemala, Peru, Braz il, Ban gladesh, Myan mar, In do n esia, Irian Jaya, Timo r, an d in Mo luccas. Multin atio n als have targeted extractive o p eratio n s thro ugh the twen ty- first cen tury. The Un ited Natio n s Multi-Natio n al Divisio n clearly sho ws where co rp o ratio n s have iden tified their n ext sites o f o p eratio n . Yo u can n o t un derstan d ho w the extractive fro n tier o p erates witho ut un derstan din g the ro le that go vern men t p lays. I p icked up a sto ry in Can ada. It’s defin itely n o t the wo rst. If I wan ted to use the wo rst, I’d p ro bably go straight to the o il co mp an ies. But this o n e takes p lace in the Bo real Fo rests, which are 2 3 0 miles n o rthwest o f Edmo n to n , Alberta, the ho me o f the Lubiko n Cree. The Alberta go vern men t first o p en ed their territo ries fo r o il exp lo ratio n in the 1 9 7 0 s an d the Cree fo ught an in jun ctio n to sto p it. While the highest co urt in Can ada ruled that there was clearly “en o ugh eviden ce to merit a trial,” they refused to issue an in jun ctio n an d n o thin g was do n e. By 1 9 8 4 , fo ur hun dred wells were drilled within twen ty-five miles o f the co mmun ity an d the Cree wen t to the UN in Gen eva, Switz erlan d, an d filed a human rights co mp lain t. Fo ur years later, Deshiwa Maribun i In tern atio n al (DMI) leased eleven tho usan d sq uare miles o f Cree territo ry fro m the go vern men t to build a half-billio n -do llar p ulp mill. The Lubiko n Cree barricaded the ro ads. The go vern men t o ffered o n e hun dred sq uare miles an d $4 5 millio n as a settlemen t, which ro ughly breaks do wn to abo ut $4 1 2 a sq uare mile, min us 1 0 ,9 0 0 ,0 0 0 sq uare miles o f traditio n al territo ry. By 1 9 8 1 , o n e year after DMI had mo ved in an d five years after the co mp lain t had been filed, the UN did declare that the Lubiko n Crees’ human rights were vio lated, an d n o thin g was do n e. The Cree, with an o rgan iz atio n called Frien ds o f the Lubiko n , o rgan iz ed a co n sumer bo yco tt o f all DMI p ap er p ro ducts. By 1 9 9 5 , fo rty-five tho usan d retail sto res had jo in ed the bo yco tt. At this p o in t, DMI sued the Lubiko n Cree. By 1 9 9 8 , two swift years by all these stan dards, Justice McPherso n awarded o n e millio n do llars o f damage to DMI, but he did allo w the p icketin g to resume, an d within two mo n ths DMI p ulled o ut fro m the territo ries. A year later the actual legal co sts were o verturn ed, so in the en d the Lubiko n Cree p ro tected their territo ries, they p ro tected the very sacredn ess o f the fo rests in which they live an d in ho w they exp ress themselves an d in the sen se o f their survival. But there is examp le after examp le o f In digen o us Peo p les who have n o reco urse within their o wn co un tries. The Bro ken Hill Pro p erty Gro up o ut o f Australia have jo in ed Pap ua New Guin ea to p ass legislatio n makin g it a crimin al o ffen se fo r an y In digen o us Peo p les to research, o rgan iz e, o r challen ge an y multin atio n al o p eratio n s in Pap ua New Guin ea. British Petro leum did the very same thin g in Do min ica. We, In digen o us Peo p les, are the stewards o f the last remain in g truly sacred territo ries. They are the critical habitats an d the bio diversity ho t sp o ts. In digen o us Peo p les wo n ’t stan d a chan ce o f survivin g the twen ty-first cen tury witho ut everyo n e’s help . The liberaliz atio n o f trade an d its co rresp o n din g acceleratio n o f glo baliz ed markets threaten o ur survival mo re n o w than ever befo re. But I say “o ur survival,” I do n ’t say “In digen o us Peo p les’ survival.” This is n o t just abo ut In digen o us Peo p les. No r is it just abo ut the right thin g to do . This scen ario will destro y all o f us. It is in gatherin gs, such as the Bio n eers o r the So cially Resp o n sible In vestmen t Fo rum, o r the Wo rld Trade Organ iz atio n an d IMF demo n stratio n s, that a un ity o f vo ice is heard. No w mo re than ever befo re In digen o us Peo p les n eed yo ur allian ce. First Peo p les Wo rldwide has begun a majo r In digen o us Peo p les’ rights camp aign . We have design ed a n ew so cial in vestmen t screen . Its basic screen in g p rin cip les o r criteria have been a distillatio n o f all o f the in tern atio n al treaties an d the rights that have been set fo rth by these in tern atio n al treaties; an d we’ve co me up with abo ut eight p rin cip les that go in to screen in g an y an d every in vestmen t. What we have right n o w, thro ugh this in vestmen t screen , is the o n ly in tern atio n al advo cacy vehicle fo r In digen o us Peo p les. Because with the San s, with the Cree, when we wen t to the Un ited Natio n s, we wen t to the In tern atio n al Labo r Organ iz atio n . We wen t to the Wo rld Ban k. We were always to ld, sure, we’d really like to help yo u, but we have to be in vited in by yo ur co un try. No w, what co un try is go in g to say, Co me o n do wn . Watch us kill an d disp lace In digen o us Peo p les? It do esn ’t hap p en . The in vestmen t screen gives us a fo rum we can use to have the market p ro tect o ur culture, n o t destro y it. In 1 9 8 2 , Calvert became o n e o f the very first mutual fun ds to take a stan d again st ap artheid. Back then they said it wo uldn ’t matter. Back then they said it co uldn ’t be do n e. Yet we all saw an en d to ap artheid. The screen can beco me a p o werful to o l an d I ask yo u to use it. In additio n , to gether, we n eed to build an in tern atio n al camp aign to sto p the gen o cide o f In digen o us Peo p les. We can do this by takin g lesso n s fro m the divestiture o f So uth Africa, takin g lesso n s fro m the en viro n men tal mo vemen t’s ability to mo biliz e reso urces, takin g lesso n s fro m the n etwo rkin g used to defeat the MIA. We kn o w that we can kill all human kin d with a sin gle bo mb. We can destro y the o z o n e. We can blo w up the p lan et. This mean s the curren t rules o f the game must chan ge. These are n o t win o r lo se, p o wer an d co n tro l scen ario s an y lo n ger. With the curren t circumstan ces, we all lo se. The in terdep en den cy o f human kin d, the relevan ce fo r relatio n ship , the sacredn ess o f creatio n is return in g as a fact o f life. It is an cien t, an cien t wisdo m. Mo re than an y sin gle issue, eco n o mic develo p men t is the battle lin e between two co mp etin g wo rldviews. Tribal p eo p le’s fun damen tal value was with sustain ability an d they co n ducted their liveliho o ds in ways that sustain ed reso urces an d limited in eq ualities in their so ciety. What made traditio n al eco n o mies so radically differen t an d so very fun damen tally dan gero us to western eco n o mies were the traditio n al p rin cip les o f p ro sp erity o f creatio n versus scarcity o f reso urces, o f sharin g an d distributio n versus accumulatio n an d greed. Of kin ship usage rights versus in dividual exclusive o wn ership rights. An d o f sustain ability versus gro wth. In the field o f eco n o mic develo p men t, eco n o mists like to thin k western eco n o mics is value-n eutral, but the fact is, it is n o t. What do es the fin an ce system tell us abo ut fun ctio n an d fo rm, abo ut o ur very values, when the same system p ays a merger acq uisitio n ist millio n s o f do llars an d a teacher $4 0 ,0 0 0 ? The Cartesian reductio n ist ap p ro ach defin ed success acco rdin g to p ro ductio n un its o r mo n etary wo rth. The co n trast with successful In digen o us develo p men t is stark. Fo r examp le, because the No rthern Cheyen n e un derstan d the en viro n men t to be a livin g bein g, they have o p p o sed co al strip min in g o n their reservatio n because it kills the water bein gs. There are n o co st measuremen ts o f p o llutio n , p ro ductio n , o r o ther elemen ts that can cap ture this kin d o f imp act. There is an emergin g reco gn itio n o f the n eed fo r a sp iritual base, n o t o n ly in o ur in dividual lives, but also in o ur wo rk an d in o ur co mmun ities. Perfect harmo n y an d balan ce with the laws o f the un iverse mean s that we all kn o w that the way o f life is fo un d by p ro tectin g the water bein gs. The In digen o us un derstan din g has its basis o f sp irituality an d reco gn itio n o f the in terco n n ectedn ess an d in terdep en den ce o f all livin g thin gs—a ho listic an d balan ced view o f the wo rld. All thin gs are bo un d to gether, all thin gs co n n ect. As the famo us q uo te by Chief Seattle states, “What hap p en s to the earth, hap p en s to the children o f the earth. Human kin d has n o t wo ven the web o f life. We are but o n e thread. Whatever we do to the web, we do to o urselves.” The en viro n men t is p erceived as a sen sate, co n scio us en tity suffused with sp iritual p o wers thro ugh which the human un derstan din g is o n ly realiz ed in p erfect humility befo re the sacred who le.

We believe it’s always been a co existen ce o f bo th my p eo p le an d the human s o n the lan d with the p hysical thin gs aro un d them. It is a shared sp iritual relatio n ship . As I’ve been to ld, even befo re the Euro p ean s came, the p eo p le who came fro m the West were welco med. Even to day, we still welco me p eo p le who have n o w co me fro m the East. When Euro p ean s did co me, we kn ew there was susten an ce fo r all an d there was n o such thin g as p rivate lan d o wn ership . Yet what we saw in the last five hun dred years was exp lo itatio n an d a devastatin g n ew way o f life that was imp o sed up o n Native Peo p les. To day, at my ho me, the p ueblo o f Aco ma, we still call o urselves Aa kuume . We are o f Aco ma. Our p lace is called Aakuu. Aa kuu co mes fro m the Aco ma wo rd H a a kuu. It mean t, an d still mean s, “p rep ared.” It was an d is the p ro mised lan d fo r the p eo p le o f Aco ma. I am an Aco ma. I am Petuuche, which is the n ame my mo ther’s father gave to me. I am o f my mo ther’s clan , the Eagle clan , so I am an Eagle. An d I am o f my father’s clan , the An telo p e clan , thus I am also p art An telo p e. Amo n g the Aco ma p eo p le, we have these relatio n ship s to each o ther, the clan s o f p eo p le to each o ther. Even to day when o ur religio us p eo p le get up in the mo rn in g an d go to the east en d o f Aco ma with their co rn meal an d turn to the n o rth an d say p rayers, they are p rayin g fo r all thin gs: the ro ck o f Aco ma, the lan d o f Aco ma, the water, the an imal life, the p lan t life, all p eo p le in the wo rld. They are p rayin g fo r co existen ce where we may all survive p eacefully an d there may be abun dan ce, an d there may always be p len tiful rain s. As I drive fro m Aco ma, so metimes it rain s a slight drizzle all the way to San ta Fe. When it thun ders o r starts to rain , we say pe h-e h-c ha , “let it rain .” Because o ften times we co mp lain abo ut the sto rms o r the win ds o r the thin gs that may be irkso me to us, bo therso me in so me way, but all tho se thin gs fit in a p art o f o ur wo rld. I remember an o ld Aco ma man , an Elder that has p assed o n , an d who n ever wen t to scho o l, who talked abo ut these chan gin g weather co n ditio n s. He to ld me, “I n ever wen t to scho o l because I had to wo rk, an d we had to sup p o rt each o ther. Even in my yo un ger days as I was livin g in the co un try an d herdin g sheep , when it used to rain , the clo uds wo uld co me fro m the west in a gen tle ro llin g way an d yo u co uld see the clo uds brin gin g the rain an d it wo uld just be rain in g so ftly. What yo u see to day is scary, ” he said. “There’s a lo t o f thun der, there’s a lo t o f win d, there’s a lo t o f lightn in g, an d it’s almo st as if there’s an an ger. It’s very disturbin g to day.” He said that this was p ro p hesied, that sto rms wo uld o ccur when the en velo p e aro un d the earth was to rn by man , an d p eo p le wo uld be beaten up by sto rms. An o ther Aco ma man agreed that this is p art o f o ur p ro p hecy. Other In digen o us Peo p les kn o w this to o . It’s p art o f o ur In digen o us co n scio usn ess. We kn o w these chan ges that we’re brin gin g abo ut are man - in duced. In these last years it has in creased dramatically at a very rap id p ace. So this is the p o wer o f co lo n izatio n an d n o w we have this n ew way o f life that we’re so meho w buildin g to gether. The challen ge is go in g to be o ur reso cializatio n o f each o ther in p ro ducin g o urselves as n ew p eo p le. At Aco ma I like to say that the n ext five hun dred years are go in g to p ro duce a n ew typ e o f Aco ma p erso n . We can see, fo r examp le, lan guage lo ss, an d we can see the culture chan ge that co mes abo ut as a result o f n o t bein g able to p ractice o ur religio us ways as co mp letely as befo re. We are exp erien cin g the lo ss o f o ther cultural ways because o f the in ability to talk Aco ma an y mo re. An d yet, we say that as clan s die o ut, n ew clan s are made. As we lo se sacred shrin es because o f destructio n by eco n o mic develo p men t, co al min es o r gas min es, we en co urage the revitalizatio n o f n ew areas. We en co urage the develo p men t o f n ew so n gs o r the revitalizin g o f o ld ways an d brin gin g tho se back in to use. That’s the way we feel thin gs chan ge an d co n tin ue. It’s always been in the develo p men t o f o ur histo ry an d in the destin y o f a p eo p le. We can be self-determin in g an d we sho uld be. We must be. This is the essen ce o f co existen ce that we’ve always esp o used—always bein g in eq ual relatio n ship . There’s a resp o n sibility that co mes with bein g here o n the lan d. There’s a resp o n sibility that co mes with bein g here first in tryin g to make o ther p eo p le un derstan d that we’re all p art o f this p hen o men a, o f this co smo s. We have a duty to main tain this relatio n ship . I have a duty to try to do what my an cesto rs did fo r me to survive, fo r me to be alive at Aco ma to day. I see the n ext five hun dred years as n o t o n ly accep tin g the resp o n sibility to educate p eo p le abo ut lo ve fo r Mo ther Earth, but also ho n o rin g their p erso n al way, to o . Even after five hun dred years, in sp ite o f all the bad feelin gs that have co me abo ut, we still welco me p eo p le who co me to Aco ma. We mean it, because we’re all co existin g to gether. We must n o w survive to gether. It is o ur resp o n sibility to do so , in p eace an d resp ect, fo r all thin gs an d fo r all p eo p le o n the lan d.

This p ro cess is a traditio n al metho d the Okan agan use fo r buildin g co llabo ratio n , co llective decisio n -makin g, an d co n sen sus-makin g. It is based o n the un derstan din g that every so ciety, gro up , o r o rgan izatio n has fo ur main ro les—elders, mo thers, fathers, an d yo uth—an d these “so cieties” rep resen t areas o f co n cern : traditio n , relatio n ship , actio n , an d visio n , resp ectively. By lo o kin g at the co n cern s o f each gro up , better decisio n s are made. As far as ethics an d p ro to co l, what I first n eed to address is the lan d. We are fro m a so ciety that had an abun dan ce o f n atural reso urces fo un d within o ur traditio n al territo ry an d we are o bligated an d duty-bo un d to p ro tect an d caretake this lan d that we belo n g to . My p eo p le are n o t p acifists. Our histo ries have been p assed do wn fro m gen eratio n to gen eratio n fo r tho usan ds o f years, it is thro ugh these o ral p ro cesses that we en ded up havin g Okan agan n ames fo r the mo un tain s an d the streams, as well as the sacred an d ho ly p laces fo un d within o ur territo ry. As Okan agan p eo p le, we are fro m the lan d; we are a p art o f it; therefo re, we have an o bligatio n as s q ilxw ( o rigin al p eo p le who learn ed to live to gether o n the lan d in p eace) , as we call o urselves, to p ro tect an d sp eak fo r this lan d that can ’t sp eak fo r itself. This territo ry is o ur ho me. If we wan t to lo o k at it in to day’s mo dern co n text, it is o ur p lace in sp ace an d time. If we wan t to co n tin ue to survive in o ur ho melan d, we have an o bligatio n to p ro tect it. As o ur so ciety has develo p ed culturally, eco n o mically, an d so cially, we have been taught ho w to in teract with o n e an o ther. Cultural ethics an d p ro to co ls were adap ted an d tran sfo rmed. Our educatio n system is the n atural en viro n men t, it beco mes the educatio n al to o ls fo r o ur children , an d it is o ur scho o l. As it may be, the adults an d Elders became the teachers, because they were the o n es who carried the kn o wledge an d sacred teachin gs o f o ur p eo p le. Our co n n ectio n to the lan d has to be the fo un datio n o f o ur so ciety. Fo r un to ld gen eratio n s, we evo lved fro m the lan d an d we learn ed to co me to an un derstan din g that this is o ur basis o f teachin gs. Again , these teachin gs were p assed do wn o rally fro m gen eratio n to gen eratio n . It is thro ugh the study an d in terp retatio n o f these o rigin sto ries that we were given metho ds an d techn iq ues, framewo rks if yo u will, fo r ho w we are to live an d in teract with this lan d. It is thro ugh these sto ries that we were sho wn ho w to settle disp utes an d ho w to get alo n g with o n e an o ther, an d to do this in a man n er that makes bo th sides co mfo rtable, a p ro cess whereby each feels that they had an eq ual say in the reso lutio n p ro cess. The traditio n al p ractice in o ur territo ry is called the En ’o wkin wiwx. We have adap ted an d tran sfo rmed it to fit an d acco mmo date the sp ecific co n flict reso lutio n n eeds o f in dividuals, co up les, co mmun ities, an d Natio n s. Establishin g the ethics an d p ro to co ls at the start o f this p ro cess is an imp o rtan t first step , as it gives fo rm an d stability to the p ro cess. It levels the p layin g field fo r everyo n e in vo lved. Peo p le sho uld to tally co mmit themselves to co n flict reso lutio n . Fro m o ur o bservatio n s, even when in dividuals do n o t to tally co mmit themselves to the En ’o wkin wiwx p ro cess, it beco mes such a p o werful exp erien ce that they en d up gettin g swep t up in to it an yway. The resistan t in dividuals en d up bein g stro n g p ro p o n en ts o f the p ro cess. It is an emp o werin g exp erien ce! It reaches do wn an d deals with the un co n scio us p art o f their bein g, the life fo rce o f the bein g: their sp irit. There is a healin g p ro cess that hap p en s in this techn o lo gy. It’s hard to give wo rds to it. We have seen so me min o r miracles that have co me o ut o f this p ro cess, as far as healin g a co mmun ity, healin g gro up s o f p eo p le, takin g p eo p le o ut o f dire situatio n s where death was immin en t. We have seen situatio n s where p eo p le were willin g to co mmit acts o f gen o cide again st o ur p eo p le. Yet the Fo ur So cieties p ro cess ( En ’o wkin wiwx) wo rked o n these in dividuals witho ut them co n scio usly bein g a p art o f it. It defin itely chan ged so me hardco re p eo p le that were p o licin g o ur co mmun ities. They had fallen head- o ver-heels in to the p ro cess an d were willin g to listen an d do an ythin g that we suggested. That’s the p o wer o f o ur traditio n al teachin gs. On e o f the main messages that I wan t to say abo ut the Fo ur So cieties p ro cess is that it is fro m this lan d. It isn ’t bo rro wed fro m an Eastern p hilo so p hy. It is fro m here! It belo n gs here! It eman ated fro m this lan d. It is a p o werful to o l to be used in this way, it is a p eace techn o lo gy; it is a traditio n al Okan agan fo rm o f co n flict reso lutio n .

This can create a ten sio n that is n o t always co mfo rtable an d is o n e that is faced by so me o f my o ther co lleagues who are First Natio n s.

Durin g that time I co mp leted a master o f educatio n degree that lean ed heavily o n the en gin eerin g co urse elective that I had develo p ed. My master’s degree was called Ho n o urin g In digen o us Scien ce Kn o wledge as a Mean s o f En surin g Western Scien tific Resp o n sibility. This thesis made the case fo r In digen o us scien ce. It exp lo red the wo rk o f Pam Co lo rado , Oscar Kawagley, Greg Cajete, David Bo hm, an d o thers who co n sidered In digen o us Peo p les’ kn o wledge as scien tific an d kn o wledge that mo dern scien ce bo rro ws fro m.

Sho rtly thereafter, I became in vo lved in the wo rk o f the Co n ven tio n o n Bio lo gical Diversity, with co lleagues fro m aro un d the wo rld. This in vo lvemen t bro aden ed my un derstan din g o f the ways that the wo rld’s bio diversity was un der threat.

So me have called this lust fo r earth’s last p recio us reso urces “the n ew co n q uistado r,” a referen ce to the go ld seekers who first co lo n ized an d p illaged the so -called New Wo rld.

WHO ARE THE WORLD’S ABORIGINAL PEOPLES? Abo rigin al Peo p les in the wo rld curren tly n umber in the ran ge o f five hun dred millio n .

DEFINITION OF INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE In digen o us Kn o wledge ( IK) has man y defin itio n s dep en din g o n whether o n e is a scho lar o r o n e is co mmun ity-based. There are p ro bably mo re q uestio n s than an swers in relatio n to IK defin itio n s an d because I believe that this defin itio n is ever develo p in g I have in cluded man y q uestio n s in my defin itio n . As a bo dy o f kn o wledge, IK, albeit with differen t n ames, has gain ed curren cy in the last twen ty years amo n g researchers an d go vern men tal agen cies, as well as civil so ciety o rgan izatio n s. In digen o us Peo p les view IK as so methin g that has sustain ed their co mmun ities sin ce time immemo rial. Dako ta Elder Ken Go o dwill states that In digen o us Kn o wledge is valid in its o wn right an d do es n o t n eed to be validated by o ther systems. The Can adian In tern atio n al Develo p men t Agen cy uses the fo llo win g defin itio n , “In digen o us Kn o wledge rep resen ts the accumulated exp erien ce, wisdo m an d kn o w-ho w un iq ue to cultures, so cieties, an d/o r co mmun ities o f p eo p le, livin g in an in timate relatio n ship o f balan ce an d harmo n y with their lo cal en viro n men ts.

Others have defin ed IK as lo cal kn o wledge that is un iq ue to a culture o r a so ciety an d o utside o f the fo rmal educatio n al system. IK is that kn o wledge that allo ws co mmun ities to survive an d is the basis fo r decisio n - makin g in the aren as o f health, agriculture, fo o d p rep aratio n , n atural reso urce man agemen t, an d educatio n . Co mmun ities rather than in dividuals ho ld it. It is embedded in co mmun ity p ractices, rituals, an d relatio n ship s an d is difficult to co dify. IK is p art o f everyday life. Co llectivity is cen tral to In digen o us bein g an d the co llectivity o f In digen o us Kn o wledge is reflected in man y ceremo n ies an d teachin gs. Abo rigin al scho lars an d lo cal p eo p le have described In digen o us Kn o wledge with labels that reflect an cien t kn o wledge o f co mmun ity life, well-bein g, an d shared values. In the Cree lan guage, this is called p imatis s iiwan . A co re value is miyo - wicehto win , which mean s havin g go o d relatio n s. In dividually an d co llectively an d sin ce time immemo rial, p eo p le have been in structed by their teachin gs to strive an d co n duct themselves in ways that create p o sitive relatio n ship s. My p eo p le, the Cree, begin each day by smudgin g with sage, which help s us to p urify o ur tho ughts, actio n s, an d deeds. Smudgin g en sures that o ur actio n s will be do n e with a go o d heart an d a go o d min d an d with gratitude fo r the gift o f livin g an o ther day. This ritual also remin ds us to p erfo rm o ur duties fo r the bettermen t o f human ity. Referen ce is made to the co n cep t o f “all my relatio n s,” which mean s that all o f human ity an d livin g thin gs are related an d must be cared fo r by o n e an o ther. No rthern Athabascan values an d wo rldviews are similar an d fo cus o n self-sufficien cy, hard wo rk, care an d p ro visio n fo r the family, go o d family relatio n s, un ity, humo r, ho n esty, fairn ess, an d lo ve fo r children .

The fun damen tal thin g abo ut bein g Iro q uo is is that p eo p le will n o t argue abo ut beliefs o r religio n s. In side o ur traditio n al religio n are all kin ds o f differen t beliefs, an d n o t everyo n e shares all tho se beliefs. But there is also in o ur culture a co re req uiremen t that ultimately, whatever o ur beliefs are, we are en co uraged to main tain : the traditio n o f clear thin kin g. Clear thinking is the fo un datio n o f the Great Law an d is an ever-recurrin g theme in what is kn o wn as the Ganyodaiyo, o r Go o d Message o f Han dso me Lake. It’s also discussed even in p arts o f o ur an cien t traditio n , the sto ry o f ho w the wo rld came to be the way it is. We call this in En glish the Creatio n Sto ry. My versio n o f Native American studies was that we wo uld be the critics o f Western culture. We wo uld do what Western culture an d an thro p o lo gists do to In dian culture: review it, p o in t o ut what’s wro n g with it, exp lain where it wen t wro n g, tell them it was wro n g, an d basically have a versio n an d un derstan din g o f it. To do that mean t that I had to take a clo se lo o k at the o rigin s an d the p hilo so p hies aro un d scien ce, an d the o rigin s an d p hilo so p hies abo ut p hilo so p hy: the who le q uestio n o f where the culture tells us it is co min g fro m, where it says it is, an d where it says it is go in g. I am surp rised a little, given that histo ry, that we seem to be mo vin g to ward a differen t p lace. We have p eo p le n o w who are very clearly amo n g the best scien tists who are willin g to agree that there are limits to the kn o wledge that scien ce can have abo ut n ature. We’re reachin g a p lace in which there’s ever-wider agreemen t that p o etry gives us as much in fo rmatio n abo ut o ur relatio n ship with the un iverse as telesco p es do , an d that tho se two strain s can live to gether an d co mp lemen t o n e an o ther harmo n io usly. Tho se two thin gs can hap p en , an d that’s actually n o t dissimilar to my culture, which asserts that o n the o n e han d there are dreams an d visio n s an d o n the o ther han d there’s a resp o n sibility to main tain a clear versio n o f reality. Tho se two streams o f tho ughts an d reactio n s have to live co o p eratively to gether. The idea that the sp iritual an d the secular can live side by side is extremely imp o rtan t at this time. I also believe that, while we may n o t agree o n everythin g that we believe in , there are a few thin gs that are emergin g that almo st everyo n e can believe in . The Iro q uo is culture has a traditio n that every time we gather to gether to have a meetin g, we o p en with what is called a ga no ya o r o p en in g sp eech. So me p eo p le call it a than ksgivin g address. That talk is what everyo n e who is san e in the wo rld sho uld agree o n . It’s kin d o f like Iro q uo is dip lo macy: we start with what we agree o n an d then we keep go in g to the thin gs that we can n o t agree o n . So what is it that we all agree o n ? The sp eech starts with an o p en in g that we see o n e an o ther; we n eed each o ther; we n eed p eo p le to be in the wo rld an d it’s a go o d thin g that there are p eo p le in the wo rld; we’re grateful an d than kful that there are o ther p eo p le in the wo rld an d it’s go o d to see them here, so we give a greetin g. We ackn o wledge o thers in o ur greetin gs an d than ksgivin g an d we greet o n e an o ther with this in min d. Sin ce that’s ho w we do thin gs amo n gst o urselves, we sho uld be able to do that with o ther bein gs, an d so it go es o n an d we do greetin gs to the earth. Everybo dy sho uld be able to give greetin gs to the Mo ther Earth. She’s a p erso n , an d—call it p o etic—it’s a way o f us havin g a relatio n ship with that, so we ackn o wledge that relatio n ship , it’s fun damen tal. Right after p eo p le, earth. Then it go es to grasses, waters, trees, p lan ts, win ds, the mo o n , the stars, the sun , the un iverse, the who le thin g. Everybo dy in the wo rld o ught to be able to agree that we dep en d o n tho se thin gs. Tho se thin gs are actually essen tial to us, an d that’s the ratio n al min d, with a p o etic way o f exp ressin g a ratio n al min d. So me p eo p le lo o k at that an d say that’s sp iritual. Whatever yo u call it is fin e. It’s us exp ressin g o ur p o sitive relatio n ship to all the o thers, every o ther that we can thin k o f. We have n o t sep arated o urselves fro m them. They are o thers an d we are p art o f the o thers. We do this sp eech at the begin n in g an d the en d o f every meetin g because p eo p le n eed to be remin ded o f that. It’s a co n stan t remin der. I thin k that n o w we n eed also to ackn o wledge scien ce as a fo rm o f gatherin g in fo rmatio n , a very imp o rtan t o n e. In a way, scien ce has claimed to be mo re than that. There has been a traditio n in the West claimin g that scien ce had a p o wer greater than a system that gathers in fo rmatio n fo r us. I thin k that leaves a lo t o f p eo p le feelin g n egative abo ut scien ce. But I wan t to be p o sitive abo ut scien ce because we are n o w begin n in g to have a mo men t when it is p o ssible fo r p eo p le acro ss cultures to have a p o sitive view o f n ature. Nature is what keep s us alive. It is n o t o ur en emy. It is what gave us life in the first p lace. In my culture they call the givers o f life Jo Ha Cho. They call the creator o f life Ho Cha Ne Tom. The creato r o f life an d the givers o f life are differen t. The creato r o f life is that which existed in the un iverse, an d the Jo Ha Cho is what existed here o n this p lan et in this sp here: the p hysical bein gs with a sp iritual face that create o ur lives an d make us live. No w we’re faced with a reality that p eo p le have been p layin g with the Jo Ha Cho . They’ve been co n cludin g that they can p lay Go d, a versio n o f Go d. They wo uld claim the right to sp lice gen es, to fo o l with the buildin g blo cks o f life. I p ro p o se to yo u that they’ve been do in g that fo r a lo n g time. This isn ’t n ew. It’s been hap p en in g fo r a lo n g time, ever sin ce the evo lutio n o f chemistry, an d it is co min g in to everyday life. Every o n e o f us has thin gs in o ur bo dies that o ur an cesto rs n ever had in their bo dies. Everythin g that is alive o n the who le p lan et has chemicals in its bein g that didn ’t used to be in its bein g. The seco n d thin g is that the thin gs o f n ature are n o lo n ger available to us. Fro m the air we breathe to the water we drin k to the fo o d we eat, every o n e o f these has been altered fro m the way o ur an cesto rs exp erien ced tho se thin gs. The earth itself, when yo u p ick it up an d an alyze it, is n o t the same. Everythin g has been chan ged. Yet if n ature is sacred, it wo uld be o ur min d to chan ge it back to make it the way it was when it was sup p o rtive o f life o n the earth. This wo uld mean to make the fo o d the way it was, to make the water the way it was, to make the air the way it was, to make o ur bo dies an d everythin g o n the p lan et the way they were, the way n ature made them to be. I can see n o w that scien tists can help us do that. I can see n o w that there are scien tists who thin k that way to o , an d in that regard it seems to me that the n atural-wo rld p eo p le an d the scien tific p eo p le—all kin ds o f o ther p eo p le, even busin ess p eo p le—can be o n the same side o f so methin g. We all have to have as a go al that we sho uld see n ature resto red. The wo rd “n ature” is a little bit fuzzy here. When I say n ature, I mean everythin g that sup p o rts life o n the p lan et is n ature. Nature is so co mp lex an d its in teractio n s so dyn amic that the idea that scien ce co uld ever un derstan d it all is utterly laughable. We can un derstan d the mo re simp le thin gs that we do to in terfere with it: to degrade it, to wreck it. But we can n ever un derstan d it. It is beyo n d o ur co mp rehen sio n . The In dian cultures that I kn o w have said that n ature is a great mystery. It is so co mp lex, so great, so abo ve us, that we sho uld n ever be so arro gan t to thin k that we can un derstan d even a little bit o f it. But we can un derstan d o ur n ature. We can un derstan d the p ro fit mo tive. We can un derstan d wro n g thin kin g. We can un derstan d the co n cep t o f scien ce as a revitalizatio n mo vemen t that makes o utlan dish claims fo r itself, an d o f co urse the real scien tists say that’s n o t real scien ce but p seudo scien ce. I have really co me to embrace that idea, that real scien ce do esn ’t do that. Of co urse, man y o f the p seudo scien tists are p aid to say that. Large co rp o ratio n s that have p ro fits in min d head right fo r the un iversities an d buy the guys who are sup p o sed to be the exp erts. Then they have p eo p le who claim to be scien tists sayin g, “To bacco smo ke do esn ’t cause illn ess. No , there’s n o p ro blem with chan gin g gen es aro un d. There’s n o p ro blem with ato mic bo mbs. What are yo u wo rried abo ut? Okay, so thin gs are dyin g, but what are yo u wo rried abo ut?” So I wan t to p ro p o se that I can see that we are headed in to a n ew sp ace that p uts the n atural-wo rld p eo p le an d the In digen o us Peo p le, who still main tain their min d abo ut n ature, with very vast allies in the in dustrialized wo rld. I n ever tho ught I wo uld have that tho ught. We can lo o k at this as a glo bal co n scio usn ess that is risin g; it is co min g fro m p eo p le to who m n ature is like religio n . The culture that I co me fro m sees the un iverse as the fo un tain o f everythin g, in cludin g co n scio usn ess. In o ur culture we’re sco lded fo r bein g so arro gan t to thin k that we’re smart. An in dividual is n o t smart, acco rdin g to o ur culture. An in dividual is merely lucky to be a p art o f a system that has in telligen ce that hap p en s to reside in them. In o ther wo rds, be humble abo ut this always. The real in telligen ce isn ’t the p ro p erty o f an in dividual co rp o ratio n —the real in telligen ce is the p ro p erty o f the un iverse itself.

PA RT TWO Ind ig e nous De mocracie s 7 The Iro q uo is Co n federacy Joh n Moh a wk Histo rically, the In dian s o f the Eastern wo o dlan ds had n o co ercive ap p aratus o f state co n tro l. Tho se who kn ew them remarked that the reaso n their so cieties weren ’t in a state o f chao s was because their culture was so p o werful an d so in tern ally co hesive that the members o f its so ciety fo llo wed their cultural rules p retty well. They lived in relative p eace an d harmo n y amo n gst themselves fo r a lo n g time. I thin k that’s a very imp o rtan t message, just so we can un derstan d that this is p o ssible in the wo rld. The Iro q uo is Co n federacy has man y, man y wo n derful elemen ts to it. We co uld talk abo ut its sp irituality. We co uld talk abo ut its lo cal structure an d o rgan izatio n , abo ut what its ro les fo r wo men an d children are, but I wan t to fo cus o n o n e thin g an d o n e thin g o n ly: the o rigin s o f the Iro q uo is Co n federacy. The sto ry has it that there was an in dividual bo rn amo n g the Huro n s, o n the n o rth side o f Lake On tario , who grew up in a so ciety that was each again st all. Blo o d feuds left n o t o n ly villages fightin g villages but also in dividual ho useho lds fightin g in dividual ho useho lds. Assassin atio n s were co mmo n . Vio len ce ruled the day. Peo p le co mmitted atro cities o f every kin d again st each o ther—fro m can n ibalism to murder to mass murder. It was a time, n o t un like the twen tieth cen tury, o f abso lute ho rro r an d the degradatio n o f the human so ul. Co min g o ut o f this en viro n men t, o n e in dividual came up with an idea. He said that vio len ce is a really bad idea. In all Western tho ught, by the way, this p articular strain o f thin kin g is n ever can o n ized an ywhere. An yway, this p articular in dividual carries it further. Acco rdin g to the sto ry, he is a yo un g man , n o t yet twen ty. He go es to the p eo p le he’s livin g with, an d he says to them, “Yo u have to sto p these cycles o f vio len ce.” The cycles o f vio len ce were deep ly embedded in the laws an d custo ms o f the In dian p eo p le, an d they were abo ut reven ge, fo r real an d imagin ed in juries. So me o f it was abo ut thin kin g that so meo n e had p erfo rmed witchcraft o n yo u, an d therefo re yo u had to get even fo r that. Or so mebo dy had go tten killed an d yo u had to get even fo r that. In the en d, a sin gle murder co uld co st thirty o r fo rty lives in reven ge killin gs an d blo o d feuds. In tho se days, with the size o f the p o p ulatio n s bein g what they were, this was very sign ifican t. The way war was fo ught was also very sign ifican t because it was fo ught by sn eakin g up o n villages with war p arties an d rushin g thro ugh these villages, takin g p riso n ers an d killin g p eo p le. So this in dividual, who m we’ll call the Peacemaker, began to say, to p ut it in mo dern En glish, that essen tially war makes p eo p le crazy. When p eo p le are at war, they’re n o t thin kin g clearly, an d this is a p ro blem. Then he go es o n to try to defin e what it mean s to thin k clearly. Here’s a fello w who actually belo n gs o n the list o f great p hilo so p hers o f the wo rld because he addresses two q uestio n s: Ho w do we kn o w when we’re thin kin g clearly? An d what do es it mean to p ursue p eace? He begin s to talk to p eo p le, an d his argumen t is, “We do n ’t n eed to live this way. We have the p o wer o f o ur co llective min ds so that we can create a wo rld in which p eo p le do n o t use vio len ce, but rather use thin kin g. We co uld rep lace vio len ce with thin kin g, an d then go fro m there.” He go es fro m village to village an d p ersuades p eo p le that first we have to have a p act that says that we’re n o t go in g to co mmit vio len ce an ymo re. It’s hard to tell exactly what’s go in g o n , because these are o rally tran smitted traditio n s. But yo u have to kn o w that when yo u walk in to a village an d yo u say, “We have to p ut do wn o ur weap o n s o f war an d have p eace, ” that they’re go in g to say, “No t ’til the o ther guys do .” To which the in itial p arty will say, “Okay, let’s go talk to the o ther guys.” “Can ’t talk to them. They’re all crazy.” So Peacemaker Dekan awidah starts o ut by sayin g, “When yo u tell yo urself that yo ur en emy can ’t thin k, yo u destro y yo ur o wn p o wer to make p eace with him.” It falls in to a who le p hilo so p hy o f p eace, o n e that’s design ed to help dip lo mats walk in to in credibly to ugh situatio n s kn o win g that, un less they use their min ds to so lve their p ro blems, the p ro blems will get wo rse. To use their min ds to so lve their p ro blems, they have to first ackn o wledge that the guy o n the o ther side o f the n ego tiatio n —whatever he’s been do in g—p ro bably wan ts his p eo p le to live an d p ro bably wan ts a lo t o f the same thin gs yo u do . So this p ro cess starts by lo o kin g fo r co mmo n gro un d with the en emy. In the co urse o f these co n versatio n s, what came up was that we’re at war with these p eo p le because they’ve harmed us. They’ve do n e wro n g to us, an d we made a list o f what these wro n gs were. On e o f the wro n gs was that the o ther gro up claimed an exclusive right o f p ro p erty that we n eeded to use. In the discussio n , the Peacemaker says that the p ursuit o f p eace is n o t merely the p ursuit o f the absen ce o f vio len ce, because p eace is n ever achieved un til justice is achieved. An d justice is n o t achieved un til everyo n e’s in terests are addressed. But, he says, yo u will n ever actually fin ish addressin g everyo n e’s issues. There will always be un fin ished busin ess. Yo u can ’t achieve p eace un less it’s acco mp an ied by a co n stan t strivin g to address the issues o f justice. This mean s that yo ur jo b will n ever en d. It will n ever en d. Then he says that we have to build an in stitutio n to rep resen t this. Of co urse, he p uts to gether the chiefs o f the Five Natio n s. They co me to gether, an d they fo rm the Co n federacy. But who are the chiefs o f the Co n federacy? What’s their jo b? They’re n o t actually civil chiefs, certain ly n o t in the sen se Tho mas Ho bbes was talkin g abo ut. The chiefs o f the Co n federacy co n ven e a meetin g, the p urp o se o f which is to demo n strate clear thin kin g. There is a traditio n in the Co n federacy to q uestio n fuzzy thin kin g. They were co n stan tly called up o n to an swer the q uestio n , “What is it that yo u mean t by such an d such when yo u said that?” This meetin g was co n ducted in a co up le o f differen t lan guages. The Co n federacy has a wo n derful traditio n that, when so meo n e has a p ro p o sitio n , they get up an d they articulate their p ro p o sitio n to the o ther side, an d the o ther side has to tell them back what it was. In terestin gly, so metimes the o rigin al p ro p o sitio n is in o n e lan guage an d it co mes back in a differen t lan guage. When it’s in two lan guages an d there is agreemen t o n what it was, then we’re o n track. We’re gettin g there. The Peacemaker said that the p ro blem that human ity faces—an d all human ity faces this p ro blem—is that the absen ce o f p eace will lead to the en d o f human life o n this p lan et. He said also that in justice is the big disturber o f p eace. It’s n o t even co mbat o r warfare; it’s in justice. So lo n g as there is in justice, the p eo p le o f the p lan et face the p o ssibility o f extin ctio n . He believed, an d the wo rds here are clear, that un less we so lve the p ro blem o f in justice, we will take step s that will lead to the extermin atio n o f o ur sp ecies o n the p lan et. He didn ’t say that we’d kill each o ther o ff with war clubs. He said that in the en d, un less we achieve p eace amo n g o urselves, the p eo p le o f the p lan et will be elimin ated. I p ro p o se to yo u that he was exactly right. We’re livin g in a p erio d o f warfare between the rich an d p o o r. The rich p eo p le do thin gs that have n o virtue at all, by buyin g in to the ideo lo gies o f thin gs like glo balizatio n an d the Wo rld Ban k. Ho w p eo p le are treatin g o n e an o ther in the wo rld has n o relatio n ship at all to thin kin g abo ut ho w we sustain human life o n the p lan et —n o t in terms o f p o llutio n , n o t in terms o f fo o d sup p ly, n o t in terms o f the o cean s, n o t in terms o f the air, n o t in terms o f an ythin g. There’s n o virtue in an y sen se that So crates wo uld have un dersto o d; n o virtue at all in an y sen se that the Peacemaker wo uld have un dersto o d. Neither o f them wo uld have tho ught that clear thin kin g is p revailin g in the wo rld system that is, at this very mo men t, decidin g who gets to eat an d who do es n o t get to eat, who has a p lace to lay do wn an d who do es n o t have a p lace to lay do wn , who se children will survive even their in fan cies, an d who se will n o t. If this system co n tin ues o n an d o n in the way we’re go in g n o w, the Peacemaker will be p ro ved right. In the absen ce o f a clear-min ded idea that virtue mean s so cial justice in an eco n o mic as well as a military sen se in the wo rld, o ur sp ecies faces serio us an d almo st o verwhelmin g o dds fo r the lo n g-term future. I p ro p o se to yo u that Dekan awidah’s thin kin g was as clear an d as co rrect an d as right as an y, an d that his versio n o f virtue n eeds to be ado p ted by us all. Havin g ado p ted that versio n , we can ap p ly it to o ur ideas abo ut what we n eed to do abo ut the fo o d sup p ly, techn o lo gy, the wo rld eco n o mic situatio n , hun gry children in the wo rld, wo rld hun ger in gen eral, militarism, an d o ther issues tro ublin g o ur glo bal co mmun ity to day.

It wo uld be o n e to which the West has co n tributed very little thus far, even tho ugh I kn o w man y do wan t to co n tribute to it.

This meetin g established o ur style o f in teractio n an d relatio n ship an d was symbo lized by the Two Ro w Wamp um Belt, which rep resen ted o ur two differen t cultures. At that time, we said, “We have a can o e an d yo u have a bo at, an d in yo ur bo at yo u have man y religio n s an d man y co lo rs o f p eo p le an d ways o f life. ” We said, “In o ur can o e we have simp le life. We have what yo u might call a hard life, but a life that we like. ” “In o ur can o e is o ur p eo p le, o ur go vern men t, o ur way o f life. We’ll co n n ect o ur two bo ats, o ur ship s, an d o ur two vessels with what we’ll call the co ven an t chain o f p eace. They’ll be made o f three lin ks, the first lin k is p eace, the seco n d lin k is frien dship , an d the third lin k is ho w lo n g it will last. ” An d we said, “When we make this agreemen t it sho uld last as lo n g as the sun rises in the East, an d sets in the West, as lo n g as the rivers run do wn hill, an d as lo n g as the grass gro ws green ” ( o f which there are so me co n tradictio n s already) . But still, the sun is still risin g an d settin g an d so we made this agreemen t, this co ven an t chain , an d we ho o ked o ur two vessels to gether an d we said, “We’re go in g to flo at do wn Guswenta , the great river o f life, side by side. In p eace an d frien dship fo r as lo n g as we exist. ” That was the essen ce o f o ur agreemen t in the begin n in g. At that time, the p eo p le who were talkin g said, “Well, what will hap p en if so me o f o ur p eo p le wan t to get in to yo ur can o e? Or so me o f yo ur p eo p le wan t to get in to o ur bo at?” Our leaders said, “That’s go in g to hap p en , but mo stly it will be o ur p eo p le gettin g in to yo ur bo at, because o ur life is hard an d because it’s n o t so methin g that yo ur p eo p le are used to . There will p ro bably be a few o f yo ur p eo p le in o ur bo at, but man y o f o ur p eo p le in yo ur bo at. ” But they rep lied, “That wo n ’t be the issue, the issue will be fo r tho se that have o n e fo o t in the can o e an d o n e fo o t in the bo at. That’s n o t a go o d p lace to be. ” An d they said, “So me time in the future a great win d will co me an d it will blo w the vessels ap art an d tho se that are there will fall in to this river o f life an d n o o n e will be able to help them o n this side o f the creatio n . ” In dian Natio n s believe in the creatio n . We believe in a higher p o wer. We believe in a great autho rity. We believe that we’re ho o ked to gether, the way that we are in tertwin ed, the way that we live with o n e an o ther, all o f this o n e bein g. So that’s what we’ve been gaugin g all o f o ur agreemen ts with do wn thro ugh the cen turies, first with the Two Ro w Belt an d with man y n atio n s that have held that belt. Then the En glish lan ded o n Cap e Co d. The En glishmen lan ded there in abo ut 1 6 2 0 altho ugh there had been man y p eo p le vo yagin g back an d fo rth acro ss the sea befo re that. They were co min g fo r real o n this o n e. An d we watched them settle. Several hun dred years later, in 1 7 7 6 , they declared themselves American s an d they said they n o lo n ger had allegian ce to their father the kin g o f En glan d, that they were sep arate, that they were so vereign , that they were in dep en den t fro m En glan d. A q uestio n arises, Ho w did they make this tran sitio n ? Ho w did they chan ge fro m En glishmen to American s, because in 1 7 7 6 o r 1 7 5 0 o r 1 7 0 0 In dian s were kn o wn as American s. The co lo n ies were lo yal to their co un tries. No w these En glishmen said that they were American s. They made this tran sitio n thro ugh hun dreds an d hun dreds o f meetin gs that we held with them up an d do wn the co ast. They learn ed fro m us. The meetin gs were always o ver lan d, always o ver p ro blems, an d we came to kn o w them very well an d they came to kn o w o ur leaders very well. Our leaders sp en t a lo t o f time in Philadelp hia an d in New Yo rk an d in Alban y. The n ew American s saw an d came to un derstan d o ur idea o f bein g free. The idea o f bein g in dep en den t was everywhere they lo o ked an d they liked it an d they wan ted to beco me like us. All o f tho se p eo p le who were o ut there o n the fro n tiers lo ved to be free. As so o n as mo re p eo p le came, they mo ved, just like the In dian s did—it was gettin g cro wded. They, like us, didn ’t like bein g cro wded. They didn ’t like to wn s. They wan ted to be in the wo o ds. So at o n e p o in t, in a meetin g in Lan caster, Pen n sylvan ia, in 1 7 4 4 when several o f the go vern o rs were arguin g amo n g themselves, o n e o f the On an daga leaders sto o d up an d said to them, “Yo u kn o w, yo u’re n ever go in g to amo un t to an ythin g un til yo u q uit arguin g with o n e an o ther. ” He said, “Why do n ’t yo u make a un io n like o urs, why do n ’t yo u make a league like o ur great league o f p eace?” An d so began the in structio n o n un ity, p eace, an d demo cracy. Tho se n o tes at that meetin g were taken to Philadelp hia an d p rin ted, an d the p rin ter was n o n e o ther than Ben jamin Fran klin . He read these n o tes an d said, “That’s a go o d idea. It makes so me co mmo n sen se here. ” So in 1 7 5 4 he called the Alban y Plan o f Un io n to create this league o f p eace, like the In dian s, like the Hauden o saun ee who m the Fren ch called Iro q uo is. At this meetin g there was a sp y fo r the En glish kin g. He sen t wo rd back to En glan d an d said, “Yo ur Ro yal Highn ess, yo u must be aware, the co lo n ies are talkin g abo ut go vern men t by the p eo p le here. ” Over the n ext n in eteen years the relatio n ship between the kin g o f En glan d an d the co lo n ists deterio rated o ver issues o f mo n ey an d taxes. When the Co n tin en tal Co n gress jo in ed to gether, they called themselves the Thirteen Fires. They had a Gran d Co un cil. They used all o f o ur terms. They also used wamp um the way we did because that’s what they learn ed o ver these hun dreds o f years o f meetin g with us. In 1 7 7 5 they met again with us an d they asked us to jo in them in the battle co min g an d o ur chief said, “We kn o w yo ur father, an d we have a lo t o f agreemen ts an d treaties with yo ur father. An d we kn o w yo u; we also have agreemen ts an d treaties with yo u. We thin k this is a battle between father an d so n , best we stay o ut. ” The Six Natio n s at that time were tryin g to stay n eutral because they kn ew that a fierce fight was co min g an d it was go in g to rage o ver o ur lan ds, so we were caught in the middle o f a great battle. After hearin g o ur first resp o n se, the Co n tin en tal Co n gressio n al Delegatio n said, “Go o d, that was go in g to be o ur seco n d req uest. If yo u were n o t go in g to fight with us, then do n o t fight again st us. ” A treaty o f n eutrality was struck that day. When they return ed to Philadelp hia an d rep o rted the agreemen t, Presiden t Jo hn Han co ck began p rep aratio n s to fo rmalize this treaty an d o rdered a wamp um belt to be made with thirteen diamo n ds ( symbo ls) an d the fo rmal treaty was made at Fo rt Pitt the fo llo win g year p rio r to their an n o un cemen t o f in dep en den ce in 1 7 7 6 . Thus, this treaty, a treaty o f p eace an d n eutrality with the Hauden o saun ee ( the Six Natio n s Iro q uo is Co n federacy) , was their first treaty made as a n ew n atio n . But actually in the even t itself, Mo hawks fo ught heavily o n the side o f the En glish. On eidas fo ught heavily o n the side o f the co lo n ies. In fact, it was the On eidas who carried three hun dred bushels o f co rn to Valley Fo rge when the tro o p s were starvin g. They kep t them alive. It takes a lo t to co o k co rn . Yo u can ’t co o k co rn in o n e ho ur. It takes abo ut six ho urs to make co rn so up an d the In dian s had to fight the tro o p s while they co o ked fo r them, because yo u can ’t eat raw co rn . This is a p art o f histo ry that yo u do n ’t hear abo ut an d a p rimary reaso n why yo u’re sittin g here as American s. The histo ry o f us bein g to gether is imp o rtan t, but where did it co me fro m? In 1 7 7 4 Co n n asetaga talked abo ut this to yo ur p eo p le. He talked to them abo ut demo cracy. Ho w did he kn o w abo ut this? There was a time—a tho usan d years ago o r mo re, give o r take a hun dred years, we do n ’t kn o w, we do n ’t keep tho se kin ds o f reco rds, but it was a lo n g, lo n g time ago , lo n g befo re the white man —when we were fightin g amo n g o urselves. At that time, a great Peacemaker came amo n g o ur n atio n s an d bro ught p eace. This is an ep ic sto ry. So me say it to o k him a hun dred years to do that. Again , we do n ’t kn o w. We kn o w it was a lo n g an d difficult jo b. The Peacemaker fin ally bro ught to gether the leaders o f the o rigin al Five Natio n s: the Mo hawks, the On eidas, the On o n dagas, the Cayugas, an d the Sen ecas. He had chan ged their min ds. They were sittin g in a gro up in a p eaceful man n er an d then he laid do wn the Great Law o f Peace. He laid do wn o ur co n federacy co n stitutio n an d said, “I’m go in g to base this co n stitutio n o n the first p rin cip le which is p eace, the seco n d p rin cip le which is eq uity fo r the p eo p le, an d the third p rin cip le which is p o wer, the p o wer o f the go o d min ds. ” Tho se are the p rin cip les an d they’re dual p rin cip les. When I greeted yo u I said ska nnoh, o ur greetin g, in o ur n ative to n gue. This wo rd is the same wo rd fo r p eace, so health an d p eace are the same thin g. Yo u can ’t have p eace witho ut health. Our Peacemaker said, “S ka nnoh, p eace, eq uity fo r the p eo p le. ” Be fair. Be fair to the p eo p le. Yo u can ’t have justice witho ut eq uity. Justice co mes with eq uity. Dual p rin cip le. Then he said, “The p o wer o f the go o d min ds, the co un cil o f chiefs an d the p eo p le themselves, the go o d min ds. ” He was talkin g abo ut un ity, which is what we are talkin g abo ut n o w—to be un ited, to be o f o n e min d. An d when yo u do that yo u have great p o wer, great stren gth. This is what Co n n asetaga was talkin g abo ut in 1 7 7 4 . He in structed the Virgin ia, Pen n sylvan ia, an d New Yo rk go vern o rs to wo rk to gether in un ity. That’s what we’re go in g to do n o w. We’re thin kin g n o w, ho w are we go in g to do this to gether, to be un ited, to be o f o n e min d? Great p o wer co mes fro m that. So their discussio n reso n ates to day. When he talked to the leaders, first he said, “Ho w shall yo u kn o w yo ur n atio n ?” He said, “Yo u shall kn o w yo ur n atio n thro ugh the wo men . They will be carryin g the lin e. ” He said, “Because the earth is female the wo men will be wo rkin g with the earth. The earth will belo n g to them. ” So when a girl was bo rn yo u had a lan dho lder an d when a bo y was bo rn yo u had a lacro sse p layer, a go o d sin ger, a go o d dan cer—maybe he’d even be a chief o n e day. But he gave resp o n sibility to the wo men ; he made clan mo thers an d gave them the duty to cho o se all the leaders. He gave us a p ro cess o f raisin g leaders that did n o t in vo lve p o litics. So at the en d o f the day yo u go t a leader, n o t a p o litician . It’s a very exten sive p ro cess to ho ld a title in the Hauden o saun ee. First, the clan mo ther will cho o se, fro m her clan , the leader that she wan ts, an d that has to be agreed up o n by a co n sen sus o f the clan she rep resen ts. If they do n ’t agree, she has to fin d so mebo dy else. So it’s the clan that’s agreeable, but it’s her cho ice. If they agree, she takes her cho ice to the chief’s co un cil an d they also have the right o f veto . If they do n ’t agree, she has to start again , but if they do agree n o w yo u have a real can didate fo r this title that she ho lds, which was the n ame o f the o rigin al leader at that time o f the Peacemaker. So the titles we ho ld are the n ames o f tho se o rigin al fifty leaders. Each title den o tes an o ffice an d each leader has a dep uty. There is a clan mo ther, a chief, a subchief ( a p artn er) , an d a faith keep er ( a male faith keep er an d a female faith keep er) ; all to gether they lo o k after the welfare o f the clan itself. An d so , the p ro cess begin s by cho o sin g the leader. No w the n atio n will sen d a messen ger to the o ther ho use, which is co mp rised o f the yo un ger bro thers, the Cayugas, the On eidas, an d the Tuscaro ras, an d they will accep t the message an d they will say, “Go o d n ews. We will p rep are because yo ur ho use, the Elder bro thers, are in mo urn in g. Yo u have a chief do wn , we the yo un ger bro thers will do all the wo rk. ” When this wo rk is co mp lete, they will sen d to o ur n atio n a run n er an d up o n receivin g this n ews, say, “This is the time, these are the sp eakers, this is the p lace where we the Hauden o saun ee will raise the n ew leader. ” We sen d run n ers to all the Six Natio n s an n o un cin g that n ews an d we gather at that ap p o in ted time an d p lace an d begin this great Co n do len ce. At that ap p o in ted time the two ho uses will n o w judge this man an d determin e, by co n sen sus, if he will ho ld the title. The day begin s when the ho st n atio n an d his ho use ( his bro ther n atio n s) greet the arrivin g leaders an d p eo p le ( their side, their ho use) at the edge o f the wo o ds where ritual ceremo n y an d greetin gs are exchan ged fo r abo ut an ho ur. Then the ho st n atio n leads the way to the Lo n g Ho use, led by a man sin gin g the Hi-Hi—the ro le call o f the fifty o rigin al chiefs. When they en ter an d are seated o n their resp ective sides, the ro le call an d duties o f the fifty o rigin al chiefs’ n ames are recited again to co mp letio n , an d then an o ther sp eaker rises an d recites the sto ry o f the Peacemaker. Then the “twen ty wo rds” are recited. When that is co mp leted, the grievin g ho use is co n do led with a set o f wamp um strin gs by the o p p o site ho use, each strin g takin g a certain amo un t o f time. The strin gs mo ve in to the duties o f the clan mo ther, the chiefs, the faith keep ers, an d the p eo p le—the p eo p le have mo re duties. Each strin g is p assed to the o p p o site ho use. This takes a lo n g time. Then the great hymn is sun g by the co n do lin g chiefs, then each strin g is return ed by the co n do led ho use, rep eatin g in full each message. So the p eo p le hear the laws twice. On this day the men witho ut titles p rep are the fo o d. The wo men must be in side to hear an d o bserve everythin g. They keep the reco rds an d teach their children . Fin ally, the can didate is bro ught fo rward by the clan mo ther an d her leaders an d he is judged again . It is the gran d co un cil o f chiefs who determin e if he will sit with them, all by co n sen sus. So we hear all o f the laws, we hear all o f that. At the en d o f the day, if he p asses all o f these examin atio n s o n his o wn merits as a human bein g, we will brin g him fo rth as the titleho lder o f that clan . He must simp ly be a man o f go o d health an d co urage, a family man , resp o n sible an d ho n est. If he’s accep ted then they’ll all agree. But then they turn to the p eo p le an d they say, “Do es an yo n e here kn o w a reaso n why this man sho uld n o t be here?” An d the fin al wo rd is the p eo p le. That is demo cracy in its full fo rm. I kn o w n atio n s acro ss this great Turtle Islan d that raise their leaders a similar way. They’re cho sen by the p eo p le. They’re there by the will o f the p eo p le an d when they do n ’t p erfo rm, the will o f the p eo p le will remo ve them, an d that’s what yo u’ve go t to do n o w. Yo u must raise go o d leaders dedicated to p eace, an d to the welfare o f the co min g gen eratio n s. This p resen tatio n to o k p lace at the Bio n eers Co n feren ce in 2 0 0 3 . 9 An Okanagan Worldview of Society Jean n ette Ar ms tr o n g I grew up in a remo te p art o f the Okan agan o n the Pen ticto n In dian reservatio n in British Co lumbia, Can ada. I was bo rn o n the reservatio n , at ho me, an d I was fo rtun ate to be bo rn in to a family that was co n sidered by man y p eo p le in o ur area to be a traditio n al Okan agan family. Our first lan guage was Okan agan an d we p racticed hun tin g/gatherin g traditio n s o n the lan d. I’m still immersed in that family to day. An d while I’ve lived that life an d I co n tin ue that p ractice with my family, my co mmun ity was o n e that had been fractio n alized by co lo n izatio n , fractio n alized in man y ways in terms o f the co mmun ity itself. This gave me so me valuable in sights an d o bservatio n s. Thus, I have these two p ersp ectives in terms o f lo o kin g at so ciety: the p ersp ective o f the small, exten ded, traditio n al family sup p o rt system that I grew up in , an d that o f the larger co mmun ity fractio n alized by co lo n izatio n . On e o f the o bservatio n s I have in regard to human relatio n ship s has to do with the relatio n ship s we have with each o ther an d ho w these relatio n ship s imp act what we do to the lan d. In o ther wo rds, what we do to each o ther an d ho w we lo o k at each o ther—ho w we in teract with each o ther —is o n e o f the reaso n s that so me thin gs then hap p en to the lan d. In the exten ded-family co mmun ity that I grew up in , o ur p eo p le o rgan ized themselves in a very differen t way than what I see hap p en in g o utside o f that. I wan t to describe so me o f my p ersp ective, fro m that p o in t o f view, to yo u n o w. The lan d that I co me fro m is very dry an d semiarid. It’s co n sidered the n o rthern tip o f the Great Basin Desert an d the eco system there is very, very fragile. At this time, the Okan agan is o n e o f the mo st damaged areas an d eco systems in Can ada because o f its fragility. In o ur area man y co n servatio n ists an d en viro n men talists are very co n cern ed abo ut the sp ecies that are en dan gered an d disap p earin g there. We live in an area where extirp atio n s have been hap p en in g o ver the last o n e hun dred years; I’ve seen so me o f tho se extirp atio n s myself. This has been difficult because we grew up lo vin g the lan d. We grew up lo vin g each o ther o n the lan d an d lo vin g each p lan t an d each sp ecies the way we lo ve o ur bro thers an d sisters an d that’s the p o in t I wan t to get acro ss. That do esn ’t just hap p en as an in tellectual p ro cess. That do esn ’t just hap p en as a p ro cess o f n eedin g to gather fo o d an d n eedin g to sustain o ur bo dies fo r health. It hap p en s as a result o f ho w we in teract with each o ther in o ur families, in o ur family un its, in o ur exten ded family un its, an d in o ur co mmun ities; the n etwo rks that we make o utward to o ther p eo p le who surro un d us o n the lan d. Tho se n etwo rks are extremely imp o rtan t in so far as what hap p en s to the lan d an d ho w we in teract with the lan d. Part o f the educatio n al wo rk that I do is to fin d a way to in terp ret so me o f that an d to brin g reco n ciliatio n to members o f my co mmun ity o n my lan d to brin g health back to the lan d. I can n o t do that resp o n sibly if I can n o t create that kin d o f un derstan din g. In the Okan agan , o ur un derstan din g o f the lan d is that it’s n o t just that we’re p art o f the lan d, it’s n o t just that we’re p ar t o f the vast system that o p erates o n the lan d, but that the lan d is us . In o ur lan guage, the wo rd fo r o ur bo dies co n tain s the wo rd fo r lan d, so when I say that wo rd, it mean s that n o t o n ly is my ability to thin k an d to dream p resen t in that wo rd but the last p art o f that wo rd also mean s “the lan d.” Thus, in my min d, every time I say that wo rd an d I refer to myself, I realize that I am fro m the lan d. I’m sayin g that I’m fro m the lan d an d that my bo dy is the lan d. We lo ve to go o ut to the lan d to gather fo o d. I have do n e this every year o f my life an d co n tin ue to do so ; I lo o k fo rward to it every year. I go o ut to the lan d to gather the fo o ds that have given me life, an d given my gran dmo thers life, an d given my great-great-gran dmo thers life fo r man y, man y gen eratio n s. When we go o ut to the lan d, o ur p eo p le have p erfected a way o f in teractin g with each o ther that is resp ectful to the lan d an d resp ectful to each o ther but also fulfills so me n eeds that we have that are human in terms o f in teractio n an d relatio n ship to o n e an o ther. What o ur gran dp aren ts have said is that the lan d feeds us but we feed the lan d as well. What they mean t by that was that we give o ur bo dies back to the lan d in a very p hysical way but we also do o ther thin gs to the lan d. We live o n the lan d an d we use the lan d an d, in so do in g, we imp act the lan d: we can destro y it, o r we can lo ve the lan d an d it can lo ve us back. So o n e o f the thin gs that I was lo o kin g at in the develo p men t o f o ur educatio n al p ro gram was to fin d a way to teach abo ut ho w we, as a so ciety, in teract. I wan ted to exp lo re ho w members o f o ur co mmun ity in teract with each o ther an d to fin d a way to distill that, describe that, an d to teach an d reco n struct that in o ur co mmun ities. In the mo st basic sen se, o ur use o f the lan d relates to o ur n eed fo r fo o d, fo r shelter, fo r clo thin g, an d beyo n d. When we lo o k at so ciety, we n eed to lo o k at ho w so ciety is co n structed. There are thin gs that we n eed to live an d breathe every day. But beside that we n eed p leasure. We n eed to be lo ved an d we n eed to have the sup p o rt o f o ur co mmun ity an d the lo ve that p eo p le surro un din g us can give us. If we thin k abo ut ho w tho se two thin gs are co mbin ed to gether an d wo rk to gether, if tho se two ideas an d ideals can wo rk to gether, then we can see ho w we can either imp act the lan d in a n egative way o r in a p o sitive way. If I lo o k aro un d at ho w the lan d has been imp acted by what I call the Western culture, o n e o f the thin gs I see is an o veruse o f reso urces by so me p eo p le an d a lack o f access to tho se same reso urces fo r o thers. In o ther wo rds, there are so me p eo p le with a right to have mo re an d so me p eo p le with n o right. There are so me p eo p le who can n o t access even the mo st basic thin gs that they n eed. When yo u lo o k at the idea o f demo cracy fro m that p ersp ective, yo u can see there’s so methin g p ro fo un dly wro n g with a hierarchical system in which p eo p le sittin g n ext to yo u o r n ext do o r to yo u do n ’t have access to the same thin gs yo u do . That seems to me to be a p ro fo un dly basic co mmun al p rin cip le: Everyo n e in a co mmun ity n eeds to have the same access to the basics an d the same access to the jo ys an d p leasures o f life. On e o f the thin gs I was lo o kin g at with regard to this was the idea o f the co n struct o f ho w we make decisio n s. I lo o ked at the Okan agan decisio n - makin g p ro cess in its traditio n al sen se. I’m n o t sayin g that it’s there to day, that it wo rks to day, but elemen ts o f it are still p resen t an d have been carried fo rward because we are o n ly two gen eratio n s sin ce co lo n izatio n began . On e o f the thin gs that I came to un derstan d is that in o ur decisio n - makin g we have a wo rd, en ’o wkin wiwx, that deman ds a n umber o f thin gs fro m us. Sp ecifically, there are fo ur thin gs that it deman ds fro m us; we use that p ro cess co n tin uo usly in an in fo rmal way in o ur co mmun ity. We can also en gage it in a fo rmal way an d it’s so methin g like a framewo rk o r co n struct. Ro bert’s Rules o f Order,*7 fo r in stan ce, is tho ught o f as a demo cratic co n struct o r an un derstan din g o f demo cracy wherein the decisio n -makin g p o wer rests with the majo rity, as o p p o sed to the min o rity. Fro m my p ersp ective, embedded in that co n struct is an adversarial ap p ro ach. It sets up the o p p ressio n o f the min o rity, it sets up a dissen tio n . It sets up a co n struct in which there is always go in g to be co n flict. There are always go in g to be p eo p le who are in the min o rity an d p eo p le who are in the majo rity. I do un derstan d that this is p ro bably the easiest way fo r decisio n s to be made, ho wever, in terms o f lo o kin g at what the o utco me is, in terms o f a decisio n -makin g p ro cess in this co un try an d o n the lan d an d glo bally—systemically we might have to rethin k ho w this wo rks. Fro m o ur p o in t o f view the min o rity vo ice is the mo st imp o rtan t vo ice to co n sider. The min o rity vo ice exp resses the thin gs that are go in g wro n g, the thin gs that we’re n o t lo o kin g after, the thin gs that we’re n o t do in g, the thin gs that we’re n o t bein g resp o n sible to ward, the thin gs that we’re bein g aggressive abo ut o r tryin g to o verlo o k an d sweep un der the carp et o r sho ve o ut the do o r. On e o f the thin gs o ur leaders said is that if yo u ign o re this min o rity vo ice it will create co n flict in yo ur co mmun ity an d this co n flict is go in g to create a breakdo wn that’s go in g to en dan ger ever yo n e. This co n flict will en dan ger ho w we co o p erate, ho w we use co mmun ity as a p ro cess, ho w we thin k o f o urselves as a co o p erative un it, a harmo n io us un it, a un it that kn o ws ho w to wo rk to gether an d en jo ys wo rkin g to gether an d en jo ys bein g to gether an d lo ves o n e an o ther. If that hap p en s then the thin gs that we n eed to do o n an everyday basis fo r meetin g all o f o ur n eeds starts to break ap art. I can see ho w that’s wo rkin g to day. I un derstan d that if we thin k abo ut lo o kin g at the min o rity, if we use the p ro cess to thin k abo ut why there is a min o rity, why there is p o verty, then we sho uld be able to fin d creative ways to meet the n eeds o f the min o rities. Is it abo ut eco n o mics? Is it abo ut so cietal access? What are tho se min o rities abo ut? If we thin k o f o urselves as human bein gs with min ds, with the creativity that we have, we sho uld be able to take in to co n sideratio n ho w we can meet the n eeds o f tho se min o rities. We sho uld be able to fin d every p o ssible mechan ism that we can to brin g that min o rity gro up in to balan ce with the majo rity. The p ro cess that we call en ’o wkin wiwx asks us to do that an d tells us that if we can ’t do that in o ur co mmun ity then o ur human ity is at stake, an d o ur in telligen ce is at stake. We can ’t call o urselves Okan agan if we can ’t p ro vide fo r the weak an d the sick an d the hun gry an d the o ld an d the p eo p le who do n o t have skills. In the same way, when we ap p ro ach the decisio n -makin g p ro cess, o n e co mp o n en t is reserved fo r the lan d. We have o n e co mp o n en t in which we have p eo p le who are called “lan d sp eakers.” We have a wo rd fo r it in o ur lan guage. I was fo rtun ate in that I was train ed an d bro ught up as a lan d sp eaker in my co mmun ity. We are differen t than o ther co mmun ities in that we have differen t p eo p le, train ed as p art o f the family system, to be sp eakers fo r the children , fo r the mo thers, fo r the Elders, fo r the medicin e p eo p le, fo r the lan d, fo r the water—fo r all o f these differen t co mp o n en ts that make up o ur existen ce. My p art has been to be train ed by my Elders to thin k abo ut the lan d an d to sp eak abo ut the lan d. What that mean s is that I do n ’t rep resen t the p eo p le’s view an d I do n ’t thin k o f myself as an exp ert; I thin k o f myself as o n e p erso n who must co n tin uo usly be resp o n sible to my co mmun ity. Each time a decisio n is made, even the smallest decisio n , my resp o n sibility is to stan d up an d ask, Ho w will it imp act the lan d? Ho w is it go in g to imp act o ur fo o d? Ho w is it go in g to imp act o ur water? Ho w is it go in g to imp act my children , my gran dchildren , my great-gran dchildren , what’s the lan d go in g to lo o k like in their time? So in that p ro cess o f en ’o wkin wiwx, there’s a built-in p rin cip le in terms o f ho w we in teract. An o ther p art o f the p ro cess req uires p eo p le to lo o k at relatio n ship s. There are p eo p le who rep resen t ho w a decisio n is go in g to imp act p eo p le. Ho w is it go in g to imp act the children , what are the children ’s n eeds? What are the Elders’ n eeds? What are the mo thers’ n eeds? What are the wo rkin g p eo p les’ n eeds? So meo n e has to ask tho se q uestio n s. That’s their resp o n sibility. When they stan d up to ask tho se q uestio n s they also give their views in the same way p art o f o ur co mmun ity is asked to thin k abo ut the actio n s that n eed to be taken . Part o f o ur co mmun ity stan ds up an d says, What are the thin gs that n eed to be built? What are the thin gs that n eed to be imp lemen ted an d ho w much is it go in g to co st? All o f tho se imp o rtan t details n eed to be examin ed an d discussed. Tho se p eo p le who are do ers are given the resp o n sibility o f co n tin uo usly remin din g o ur p eo p le that there are actio n s that are go in g to have an imp act. There are actio n s that are go in g to cause a n umber o f differ en t effects later o n do wn the ro ad. If we o veruse so methin g o r if we take to o much o f a reso urce there are tho se p eo p le who are co n tin uo usly asked to stan d up to let us kn o w that. There is an o ther gro up o f p eo p le in o ur co mmun ity who we call the visio n aries, the creative p eo p le. They are the artists, the writers, an d the p erfo rmers, who se resp o n sibility is to brin g their p ersp ective in to the co mmun ity; a p ersp ective that tells everyo n e that there are in n o vatio n s, there are cr eative s o lutio n s , an d there are n ew ways we can lo o k at thin gs. We sho uld always make ro o m fo r n ewn ess because we n eed to be creative when we co me up again st so methin g that we can ’t reso lve an d that we haven ’t co me up again st befo re. So tho se p eo p le are always bro ught fo rward to lo o k fo r n ew ways to brin g creative ideas fo rth an d discuss them. All fo ur o f these co mp o n en ts within a co mmun ity can p articip ate in a decisio n -makin g p ro cess. The p ro cess then beco mes, in terms o f a demo cratic p ro cess, a differen t o n e than that o f Ro bert’s Rules. The p ro cess beco mes so methin g that is p articip ato ry, that is in clusive, an d that gives p eo p le a deep er un derstan din g o f the variety o f co mp o n en ts that are req uired to create harmo n y within co mmun ity. When we in clude the p ersp ective o f lan d an d we in clude the p ersp ective o f human relatio n ship , o n e o f the thin gs that hap p en s is that co mmun ity chan ges. Peo p le in the co mmun ity chan ge. So methin g hap p en s in side where the material thin gs do n ’t have a lo t o f mean in g, where material wealth an d the securin g o f it o r bein g fearful an d bein g frighten ed abo ut n o t havin g “thin gs” to sustain yo u, disap p ears. They start to lo se their p o wer. They start to lo se their imp act. The realizatio n that p eo p le an d co mmun ity are there to sustain yo u creates the mo st secure feelin g in the wo rld. When yo u feel that an d yo u’re immersed in that, then the fear starts to leave. When that hap p en s, yo u’re imbued with the ho p e that o thers surro un din g yo u in yo ur co mmun ity can p ro vide. This is the kin d o f wo rk that I’m in vo lved in at the En ’o wkin Cen tre. I’m talkin g abo ut all o f the co mmun ity. I’m talkin g abo ut all o f the p eo p le who live in the Okan agan an d p eo p le who we reach o utside o f that. No t just the In digen o us Peo p le, because at this time in o ur lives, o ur Elders have said that un less we can “Okan agan ize” tho se p eo p le in their thin kin g, we’re all in dan ger in the Okan agan . It so un ds very simp le an d yet it seems to be an o verwhelmin g task—a huge task—an d so me days it feels like that. So me days it seems to be so methin g that o n e p erso n has n o p o wer o ver. But I thin k abo ut my aun t who was talkin g to me the o ther day. She said, “Where are yo u headed o ff to n o w?” An d I said, “Oh, I’m go in g to this co n feren ce, the Bio n eers co n feren ce.” An d she said, “Oh, what is that abo ut?” So I did my best to exp lain it to her. An d she said, “That’s a really go o d thin g. Ho w did yo u man age to do that?” An d I said, “I’m n o t really sure, but I thin k I man aged to do that by talkin g abo ut so me o f the thin gs that seem so simp le an d everyday to us. Thin gs that seem to make sen se to us, that seem to make co mp lete stran gers in to lo ved o n es o f o urs, o n es that we’ve bro ught in to o ur co mmun ity who are n o w p art o f my family an d p art o f my exten ded co mmun ity. Peo p le like Fritjo f Cap ra an d p eo p le like Zen o bia Barlo w an d o ther p eo p le who are frien ds, who are p art o f this mo vemen t.” Fo r me, in side o f me, they feel the same as my aun t to me, an d I thin k that’s ho w we all n eed to relate to each o ther. I thin k that’s ho w we n eed to be with each o ther fo r us to be the way we n eed to be o n the lan d, so that tho se thin gs that are material lo se their p o wer o ver us. The vo ice that says, “Yo u n eed a n ew car, yo u n eed lo ts o f mo n ey, yo u n eed to do this an d yo u n eed to do that.” All o f that starts to dissip ate when we un derstan d that the p o wer is us, that we are o ur security o n the lan d; that’s what’s go in g to sustain us. The last thin g that I wan t to share with yo u is so methin g that makes a lo t o f sen se to me an d that is my father’s wo rds fo r in san ity. Fo r us it mean s that to o man y p eo p le are talkin g abo ut differen t thin gs rather than p eo p le talkin g abo ut the same thin g. There do es seem to be in san ity in the wo rld because o f what’s missin g in side in terms o f o ur human ity with each o ther. When we start to take care o f that, everythin g else will n aturally fo llo w. In the wo rk that we do , o n e o f the thin gs I’ve learn ed is the p o wer o f takin g o ur yo un g p eo p le o ut to the lan d to gather seeds o r to gather o ur In digen o us fo o ds. We started a p ro gram to rep lan t In digen o us p lan ts to ren ew the imp eriled habitat that we share with so me en dan gered an imal sp ecies; we’ve go t abo ut ten tho usan d p lan ts go in g n o w.

They just lo ve go in g o ut there, to gather seeds an d p o t them an d rep lan t the habitat. On e o ffsho o t o f this is that fo r the yo un g p eo p le who are havin g such a difficult time ( all yo un g p eo p le are havin g a difficult time) it heals them. The p ro cess o f bein g with p eo p le, o ut there o n the lan d, has a healin g imp act. It’s n o t just the wo rk o f co llectin g the seeds. Peo p le who are in farmin g kn o w this: It’s n o t just the wo rk o f co llectin g but it’s bein g with p eo p le, the co mmun ity, an d co mmun in g with each o ther. It is ho w the lan d co mmun es its sp irit to yo u: it heals p eo p le an d it do es this in an in credibly p ro fo un d way. We n eed to thin k abo ut ho w we can do mo re o f that.

They are a typ e o f p eace techn o lo gy. I have been p rivileged in my life to o bserve firsthan d so me o f the wo n derful an d an cien t p ro cesses o f the Ju/’ho an San p eo p le. These are the o bvio us ways that human bein gs sho uld behave. So me o f the thin gs I saw in this so ciety were differen t fro m my o wn so ciety, very basic thin gs like keep in g everybo dy in the lo o p o f co mmun icatio n , makin g sure that everybo dy is at the same level, imp o rtan t levelin g mechan isms rein fo rced in every way thro ugh fo lklo re, thro ugh so n gs, thro ugh man y kin ds o f so cial rituals. An d, last, makin g sure that everybo dy in the who le so ciety has a vo ice, mutuality. These an cien t metho ds o f keep in g the p eace, o f keep in g the co mmun icatio n flo win g in their so ciety, are bein g used to run their Co n servan cy, which is a bran d n ew exp erimen t fo r their p eo p le, a bran d n ew kin d o f so cial o rgan ism req uirin g its o wn bran d n ew kin d o f so cial techn o lo gy, an d they have ho n ed this very carefully an d o rgan ically fro m their an cien t traditio n s. I thin k that the resp o n se o f these p eo p le an d the n ew little go vern men t that they are fo rmin g is the exact o p p o site o f what we saw in this co un try. Ever sin ce 9 /1 1 it seems that secrets are co min g o ut, an d it is the o p p o site o f the kin d o f sharin g, mutual co n sultatio n , an d n ego tiatio n that has go n e o n fo r a very lo n g time with these p eo p le. So I thin k that that’s the kin d o f lesso n that we can learn fro m so me o f these lo n gest ten ured so cieties, which is what these p eo p le have been . They’ve fo un d that co n fro n tatio n an d p o larizatio n do n o t wo rk, an d wide co n sultatio n , wide discussio n , an d co n sen sus decisio n -makin g do wo rk. This can be seen as a fo rm o f turn in g the o ther cheek—when so mebo dy’s hard yo u n eed to be so ft. The who le p o in t o f it is to p reserve the so cial fiber because I thin k they realize that’s where their wealth lies, that’s where their stren gth an d their safety is. They do n ’t have the kin ds o f mo re artificial safety n ets that we do , with mo n ey, with health in suran ce, an d with so cial security an d so fo rth. They’ve go t to rely o n the go o dwill o f livin g p eo p le, because what else is there? I thin k that is a lesso n the Western wo rld can very well take fro m this Ju/’ho an San so ciety: we have to realize we all do live to gether o n this p lan et, an d we’re go in g to have to dep en d o n each o ther because tho se illuso ry safety n ets we tho ught we had are disap p earin g o n e by o n e. The San Bushmen an cesto rs have o bvio usly ho n ed, to a fin e p o in t o f artistry, that metho d o f gettin g alo n g with each o ther. There are so me very imp o rtan t co mp o n en ts to this. On e, o f co urse, is n o t dealin g in secrecy; o p en in g up yo ur heart to each o ther, un derstan din g where an o ther p erso n ’s co min g fro m when they’re feelin g badly, an d realizin g that it dep en ds o n yo u to take that p erso n ’s p ain serio usly an d try to do so methin g abo ut it. Perhap s last, they have a healin g traditio n that embo dies all o f these family values an d makes them p o ssible. I have seen this man y, man y times: If there are two p eo p le who are n o t gettin g alo n g with each o ther, in the healin g dan ce, they try to p ut these two p eo p le n ext to each o ther so that they can co me in to harmo n y by dan cin g to gether. Wo uld yo u say that that is true, Kxao ? Kxao: I thin k that is true. Because when they’re dan cin g with the sp irits, it takes a stro n g p erso n to sen d the arro ws o f p o wer, the healin g p o wer that the sp irits sen d. These arro ws are sen t between healers by “sho o tin g” them. The sho o tin g hap p en s by sn ap p in g the fin gers in a certain directio n . If a healer is sho o tin g yo u, if yo u fall do wn , yo u will feel that: o kay, this o n e is very stro n g. If he sho o ts yo u an d yo u’re still o n yo ur feet, he is to o weak fo r yo u. It will take a stro n ger healer to tran sfer the p o wer to yo u. So it’s ho w they’re testin g each o ther while they are dan cin g. Megan: These are arro ws o f n/om. N/o m is a sp iritual substan ce, kin d o f like electricity that p asses between the sp irits an d the dan cers. If yo u are a p erso n who is in go o d co n tro l o f n /o m, then yo u kn o w ho w to deal with these arro ws that are flyin g aro un d. ( Older p eo p le who have dan ced fo r man y, man y, man y years, fo r in stan ce, kn o w very well ho w to deal with these arro ws.) Fo r in stan ce, this man , /’An gn ! ao ( this o lder man sittin g here) , is a n/omkxa o, mean in g an “o wn er o f n /o m, o r sp iritual p o wer.” He easily go es in to altered states o f co n scio usn ess to heal p eo p le by the layin g o n o f han ds an d he can deal with these chao tic thin gs that hap p en between p eo p le. The dan ce is to cure what we thin k o f as p hysical illn ess, but mo st o f all it’s to cure p ro blems between p eo p le because tho se are the wo rst kin ds o f illn esses that there are. What p eo p le have to ld me abo ut what’s go in g o n in these beautiful dan ces is that it’s a techn o lo gy o f o p en in g the heart so that healin g en ergy can en ter an d so that p eo p le’s hearts will be revealed to each o ther an d an y p ro blems o r en mity will go o ut fro m between them. I started studyin g fo lklo re an d o ral traditio n s o f these p eo p le an d I kep t fin din g that everythin g co mes back to the healin g dan ce. Everythin g p o in ts to the healin g dan ce. It’s like the cen tral metap ho r. All the sto ries refer to it. Man y o f the metap ho rs have that at its heart—the metap ho r o f healin g an d o f o p en in g yo ur heart. It’s like a to uchsto n e o f the Bushmen culture, an d I thin k fo r that reaso n this must be so methin g that go es way back to the way that they established a wo rkable so cial fabric. I saw that p eo p le were very, very careful n ever to make themselves bigger than an ybo dy else in that culture, an d that has huge ramificatio n s. It’s a culture that is fiercely egalitarian , an d this egalitarian etho s is rein fo rced in hun dreds an d hun dreds o f ways all the time thro ugh so n gs, thro ugh sto ries, thro ugh the way children are bro ught up an d so fo rth. My sto ry co n cern s a yo un g man n amed Kxami who m I met in Bo tswan a years ago , an d he wen t o n his very first hun t. He was able to p ut an arro w, a p o iso n ed arro w, in to a large kudu, but he came back to his camp after do in g this an d p eo p le said, Well, did yo u get so methin g? He said, I didn ’t see an ythin g. That was a very mo dest way o f sayin g, Yes, I’ve go t a p o iso n ed arro w in to so methin g. Everybo dy in the camp kn ew the co de. His mo ther was there an d she kin d o f n o dded her head, Yes, it’s go in g to take so me trackin g while the p o iso n kills the an imal, but my so n has go tten an arro w in to his first large an imal. So , early the n ext mo rn in g Kxami left the camp . He wen t o ut an d tracked the an imal, all by himself fo r several days, an d a few days later he came back with so me o f the meat an d the n ews to the gro up that there was a big p iece o f meat that he n eeded help in carryin g ho me. I tho ught he wo uld then beco me a lauded hero . I tho ught that he wo uld be the ho ttest thin g aro un d. In stead, what did I fin d? I fo un d that his mo ther, his gran dmo ther, an d all o f his relatives in the camp said, “Oh, Kxami, this is a scrawn y p iece o f meat yo u’ve bro ught ho me. This is just terrible. Yo u kn o w? Can ’t yo u do an y better than this?” He also didn ’t have the right to p ass the meat o ut o r distribute it because it turn ed o ut that his gran dmo ther, who was blin d, was the o wn er o f that arro w an d she had lo an ed it to him an d had asked him to hun t fo r her, so she was the o wn er o f the meat an d she was the o n e who was able to p ass it aro un d. So I was watchin g Kxami o ut o f the co rn er o f my eye durin g this who le in terchan ge, which wen t o n o ver the co urse o f a co up le o f days, an d I tho ught, n o w surely his feelin gs are go in g to be hurt, surely he’s go in g to feel belittled. But o n the co n trary, this yo un g man seemed to have gro wn at least a fo o t while this was hap p en in g. His eyes were sp arklin g an d I had n o idea what was go in g o n . What I realized later is that this was their way o f ackn o wledgin g that he was just o n e p erso n amo n g the gro up , all o f who m n eeded the p ro tein fro m that killed an imal an d that if he p uffed himself up in an y way, then he wo uld n o t be able to hun t as well in the future. So , they in sulted the meat, they in sulted him, they bro ught him do wn a p eg o r two , o ff a p o ten tial bo astfuln ess that he might have been in to , an d he was able to brin g the so cial fabric o f his gro up fo rward. He had that wo n derful effect. His killin g that an imal had that wo n derful effect, an d it also was p art o f his gro win g up . It was reco gn ized by everyo n e. This was Kxami’s first large an imal. But all o f that hap p en ed behin d the scen es, q uietly, with n o o vert reco gn itio n to this yo un g man . He o bvio usly grew up , his family was o bvio usly glad o f the meat, but they leveled him, un mercifully. Yo u see that hap p en in g o ver an d o ver an d o ver again with these p eo p le. /’Angn! ao ( “Kiewiet”) is fro m Namibia, an d he is the chairman o f the Nyae Nyae Co n servan cy, which was the very first co n servan cy established in Namibia after in dep en den ce.

Kxao: This Co n servan cy was started in the 1 9 5 0 s with the help o f the Marshall family fro m the Un ited States.

The traditio n al hun tin g/gatherin g so ciety wo rks with so me subsidies in farmin g n o w. This co mmun ity has a lo wer develo p men t an d the highest p o verty o f an y gro up in Namibia.

This in creases their security, in creases emp lo ymen t, an d emp o wers the co mmun ity.

In the tran sp o rtatio n aren a, we bo ught so me do n key carts to en able children to be bro ught to the scho o ls. The in tro ductio n o f the do n key carts in itially imp ro ved tran sp o rtatio n but ultimately failed because the do n keys were killed by lio n s. Also , when the do n key carts bro ke do wn , there was n o rep air p o ssible. No w, to the p eacekeep in g. The Elders o r the p aren ts o f an y p eo p le fightin g will in terven e in an y disp utes. The p eo p le fightin g will be en co uraged to go o ff gatherin g in stead an d the dan gers o f fightin g with dan gero us weap o n s will be exp lain ed to them. This is effective because Elders o r p aren ts are still resp ected in the Ju/’ho an culture. This mean s that the p eacekeep in g hap p en s as a result o f p eo p le co min g to a so lutio n whereby they un derstan d o n e an o ther. This is also a way to en sure life fo r the gen eratio n s to co me. To day, life is difficult with so me o f the in dividuals, an d a p art o f o ur wo rld—we’re still in this situatio n . Maybe yo ur culture is differen t fro m o ur culture, but so metimes when o ur p eo p le are fightin g, they fight with weap o n s, which can be a kn ife o r a bo w an d arro w. These are very dan gero us weap o n s. That is why if so mebo dy tries to fight with so mebo dy, we have to try to sto p him in a go o d man n er, o therwise, he will co n tin ue fightin g. We have to co me an d co o l him do wn , sp eak n icely to him, so that he can un derstan d that maybe he is wro n g an d the o ther p erso n is right. That’s ho w yo u build up yo ur p eace. With regard to decisio n -makin g, let me give yo u an examp le o f ho w we o p erate. A family req uests a mo ve to an o ther village. This req uest is taken to the o wn er o f the p resen t village so that they can un derstan d each o ther befo re this p erso n mo ves to the o ther village. This takes p lace thro ugh the Elder fro m the village an d an agreemen t will be reached. Then , as the agreemen t is bein g reached, it is accep ted by all the members o f the village. That was the o ld way o f p eacekeep in g. No w let’s lo o k at the curren t metho d o f p eacekeep in g. To day, Ju/’ho an co mmun ities use their fo rmerly given rights to stay in n!oresi. N! o resi mean s traditio n al hun tin g territo ries, an d this mean in g is n o w bein g exten ded to in clude the co n cep t o f settled villages. The p eo p le’s rights were reco gn ized by the n ew Nyae Nyae Farmer’s Co o p erative when it was established. Fo r each n ! o re there are Elders who have the right to make a decisio n regardin g the reso urces an d the p eo p le who can stay o n the n ! o re. These Elders are the same traditio n al Elders as befo re, but there is n o w mo re fo rmality to the p ro cess. Lately, we have also chan ged co n siderably in that o ur yo un g p eo p le are receivin g mo re educatio n than befo re, which in creases their chan ces o f leavin g the villages an d fin din g emp lo ymen t with the go vern men t o r the to urism in dustries. Curren tly, we are n o w o n o ur way to buildin g up so me village p rescho o ls. We have large scho o ls in the area but we have small children to start educatin g, fro m the yo un gest ages up ward. The Nyae Nyae lan d is secured fo r the Ju/’ho an p eo p le. Educatio n in the mo ther to n gue is valuable fo r children , ho wever, even given that, few children are p ro gressin g beyo n d fo ur scho o l grades. This mean s that so me o f o ur p eo p le have n o t co mp leted their grade ten s o r twelves because they are n o t able to p ay scho o l fees an d so o n . There is a lo dge abo ut to be built that will be p ro vidin g mo re jo bs an d in co me to the Co n servan cy. We are still waitin g fo r Co un try Lo dges to build a to urist lo dge so that we can in crease emp lo ymen t o p p o rtun ities fo r o ur p eo p le. We have p ro blems with the wide scale in tro ductio n o f cro p s. Earlier we used to p ro vide so me p eo p le seed so that they co uld gro w cro p s, but the cro p s were damaged by elep han ts. With the in tro ductio n o f cattle to the co mmun ity, so me in dividuals had success. So me p eo p le ap p lied themselves to the cattle. So me p eo p le still do have cattle, but so me were lo sin g their cattle to wild an imals such as lio n s, leo p ards, an d o thers. What can p ro vide accessibility an d security fo r the villages an d the wildlife? As stated abo ve, we wo rk to in crease the wildlife p o p ulatio n to ben efit co mmun ity thro ugh tro p hy hun tin g in co me an d harvestin g meat. Our Co n servan cy has o n e o f the largest in co mes in the co un try, with liveliho o d o p p o rtun ities gen erated thro ugh craft sales an d camp sites. The Co n servan cy is bein g run by its o wn p eo p le; o n e o f them is me. I’m the p ro gram man ager. There’s n o t just o n e p erso n leadin g the Co n servan cy, there’s also a chairp erso n . Our curren t chairp erso n is here with me to day, Mr. /’An gn ! ao /’Un . No n e o f us make decisio n s alo n e: we do everythin g in co n sultatio n with each o ther.

L eslie Gray A basic q uestio n I in vite studen ts in my eco p sycho lo gy classes to ask themselves is, “ Where is the Ho ly Lan d?” I in vite yo u n o w to ask yo urself the same q uestio n . It is illustrative to n o te that it can so un d a bit p eculiar to a Native American In dian to hear n o n -In dian s refer to a sp ecified area o f the Middle East as the Ho ly Lan d. T his lan d is the Ho ly Lan d. Right here o n this No rth American co n tin en t. This is where On o n daga is. The sacred co un cil fire burn s at On o n daga still. This is where the Black Hills—the traditio n al visio n -q uestin g p lace o f Black Elk, Lame Deer, an d o ther great teachers—are. This is where the sp iritual city o f Chaco Can yo n was co n structed with every p o in t in align men t with the heaven s. This is where p ilgrims crawl o n their kn ees to be healed at Chimayo . This is where Blue Lake is. This is where Big Mo un tain is. This is the Ho ly Lan d. In fact, abo rigin al p eo p les o f the Americas have always wisely ackn o wledged that the earth itself is everywhere an d in all p arts sacred. In deed, all o ver the p lan et yo u will fin d sacred sites that were ho n o red an d p reserved by the In digen o us Peo p le o f that bio regio n . Everywhere yo u step yo u step o n the sacred bo n es o f an cesto rs. So this is the Ho ly Lan d— right here—the very so il up o n which I am stan din g. An d, o f co urse, it lies ben eath yo ur feet as well, wherever you may be stan din g. Why is it imp o rtan t to ackn o wledge the sacredn ess o f the lan d yo u are o n ? Because at the dawn o f the twen ty-first cen tury, p eo p le are still go in g to war o ver the idea that o n e sp o t in the Middle East is the Sacred Place. Or an o ther way to say it is that it is still easy fo r a few p eo p le mo tivated by p o wer an d greed to bambo o zle tho se p o p ulatio n s who see o n ly o n e p lace ( an d o n e religio n based up o n the sp iritual sto ry o f that p lace) as sacred. Here in the Un ited States fo r examp le, where the p revailin g culture still clin gs to a n arro w co n cep tio n o f a distan t ho ly lan d, the p ublic is easily dup ed in to righteo us wars that are, in fact, ultimately aimed at co n tro l o f distan t n atural reso urces. Co rresp o n din gly, we see hein o us crimes again st human ity en thusiastically co mmitted by in dividuals an d gro up s who have been p ersuaded that their p articular sp iritual sto ry, fro m their p articular p art o f the Middle East, must p revail thro ugho ut the wo rld. Seein g o n ly o n e p lace as ho ly, an d by in feren ce o thers as n o t ho ly, is a great so urce o f p ro blems. There is a very high co st in deed fo r failin g to ackn o wledge the who le earth as sacred. This p resen tatio n to o k p lace at the Bio n eers Co n feren ce in 2002. 1 2 Re sto ri n g In d i g e n o us Hi sto ry a n d Cul ture to Na ture Den n is Ma r tin ez, En r iq ue Sa lmón , a n d Melis s a K.

That wasn ’t that man y years ago . I n o ticed a chan ge fo r the better in the mid-1 9 9 0 s at in tern atio n al scien tific co n feren ces when I tried to get In digen o us p resen ters to talk abo ut their issues an d abo ut traditio n al eco lo gical kn o wledge an d Western scien ce. At these co n feren ces, we’d usually be relegated to the smallest p o ssible ro o m, but typ ically so man y p eo p le wo uld co me that we’d have to in terrup t the sessio n to get a larger ro o m to acco mmo date everyo n e. Yo u can always read the scien ce in the literature, but yo u’re n o t go in g to get much o f what In digen o us Peo p les have to o ffer abo ut their un iq ue p ersp ectives un less yo u hear it fro m them directly. But n o w in the literature, in the last ten years in tern atio n ally, traditio n al eco lo gical kn o wledge an d In digen o us lan dcare systems have caught the atten tio n o f man y scien tists glo bally. This is a go o d tren d. We do n ’t kn o w ho w lo n g this p o stmo dern deco n structio n ist win do w o f cultural relativity is go in g to be o p en . We’re damn glad it’s o p en .

In this chap ter I will discuss the fun damen tal differen ce between the Western scien tific-o rien ted en viro n men tal mo vemen t an d In digen o us wo rldviews an d p ractices. Western scien ce has man y go o d asp ects as a useful q uan titative to o l, but it do es n o t fit with In digen o us co smo lo gies an d wo rldviews. In these mo dern times o f un p receden ted en viro n men tal degradatio n , we n eed bo th; o ur go al here is to fin d o ut ho w an d where they can wo rk to gether. In wildern ess p reservatio n , in lan d man agemen t, fo restry, an d reso urce man agemen t o f all kin ds, Native Peo p les o ffer a kin d o f mo del. But it’s n o t the bio cen tric mo del that yo u’re familiar with fro m deep eco lo gy o r Aldo Leo p o ld’s lan d ethic. It’s fun damen tally differen t because it is p rimarily kin cen tric. That’s the wo rd that I have co in ed to describe a un iq ue In digen o us co smo lo gy an d relatio n ship to n ature. It’s n o t in the dictio n ary. I had to thin k o f so methin g that wo uld wo rk to exp lain that what this relatio n ship is abo ut in the un iverse is o n e o f eq uality. Human s do n ’t even have the mo ral autho rity to exten d ethics to the lan d co mmun ity, as the Leo p o ld lan d ethic an d deep eco lo gy do . Traditio n ally, we wo rk with an imals an d p lan ts. We are co man agers with an imals an d p lan ts. We do n ’t have the right to exten d an ythin g. What we have the right to do is to make o ur case, as human bein gs, to the n atural wo rld. That co mp act, that kin d o f co n tract between an imals an d human bein gs, is what has guided In dian s’ subsisten t liveliho o ds—hun tin g an d gatherin g—an d In dian agro eco lo gy an d agriculture in the wo rld fo r a very, very lo n g time. There was a time when In digen o us Peo p les in o n e p art o f this co n tin en t durin g the fur tradin g years lo st faith in that co mp act, lo st faith in that treaty between the an imals an d the p eo p le. Due to Euro p ean diseases an d the Jesuit co n versio n , o r the attemp t to co n vert main ly the Algo n q uin p eo p les o f Eastern Can ada an d the No rtheastern Un ited States to Christian ity, they bro ke this co n tract. There was a time, the Elders say, the o ral traditio n says, when an imals an d human bein gs co uld talk to o n e an o ther—that was when these co mp acts were made. This is metap ho rical, this is symbo lic, but it guides, n o n etheless, ho w traditio n al In digen o us Peo p les have related to the an imal an d p lan t wo rld. Even tually, after the n ear to tal decimatio n o f mo st fur-bearin g an imals, In dian s came back to their traditio n al resp ect fo r all relatives in the n atural wo rld. This was a relatio n ship mo del, a kin cen tric mo del, o n e in which we are all eq ual, but we have differen t jo bs to do here o n earth. If an In dian wo man , fo r examp le, were diggin g in the o ld days here in Califo rn ia, p ro bably in this very p lace in San Rafael, she wo uld be diggin g up what we call In dian p o tato es. By diggin g up that so il, mixin g n utrien ts, aeratin g it, takin g o ff little co rms*8 that stick to the mo ther co rm an d rep lan tin g them, she wo uld imp ro ve the health o f tho se co rms. They wo uld p ro p agate tho se little o n es an d then exten d the siz e o f that tract an d in crease the health an d fertility o f that tract. Where federal lan d agen cies have co me in an d fen ced o ff tho se p laces to p reserve them, tho se tracts o f In dian p o tato es have disap p eared. They’ve co n tracted to the p o in t where they’re n o thin g like they were fo rmerly. These valleys aro un d here, 1 5 0 years ago , were amaz in g seas o f blue camas in May an d Jun e, as far as the eye co uld see. We barely fin d an y camas an ymo re. The Elders say that if yo u do n ’t care fo r the p lan ts an d an imals, they do n ’t take care o f yo u. That’s recip ro city. It’s n o t so much a mo ral un iverse in the Western sen se. It’s mo re abo ut p ractical recip ro city. It’s mo re o f a co mp act. We agree to do certain thin gs an d the an imals an d p lan ts agree to do o ther thin gs, an d we ho n o r that co mmitmen t; we ho n o r that co n tract. It’s like a league o f so vereign n atio n s wo rkin g to gether. In the 1 9 2 0 s in To males Bay in Marin Co un ty, Califo rn ia, there were eleven majo r clam beds basically semido mesticated an d harvested by In dian p eo p le, the Co ast Miwo k, the very p eo p le who se lan d we are o n in Marin Co un ty. The Dep artmen t o f Fish an d Game in Califo rn ia sto p p ed the harvestin g to p ro tect the reso urce, an d the clam p o p ulatio n crashed. On ly o n e clam bed was left that had an y clams. Why? Because by mo vin g tho se clams aro un d as they harvested them, In dian s sp read o ut the p o p ulatio n , an d by mitigatin g again st an y den sities, they mitigated in the same mo ve again st an y diseases that wo uld afflict very tightly gro win g clam p o p ulatio n s. An d so the clams, by bein g mo ved, thrived. At the o p en in gs o f river mo uths o n this n o rth co ast o f Califo rn ia up in to Orego n , tribal members used to clear away the san d sp its that clo sed o ff the lago o n s an d clo sed o ff the mo uths o f the rivers. In late summer there was a Chin o o k salmo n run that was to tally dep en den t o n that clearin g o f the san d sp its so that the salmo n co uld get up befo re the rain s came. They had to mo ve fast so they wo uldn ’t get eaten by the p elican s an d the co rmo ran ts an d the seals that were han gin g o ut there, millin g aro un d waitin g fo r the rain s to co me to lift the salmo n o ver that blo ckage, which made them easy p rey fo r the birds an d seals. To day, that late summer Chin o o k run is extin ct. In dian p eo p le in British Co lumbia used to take fish eggs, salmo n eggs, an d they wo uld tran sp lan t them in mo ss fro m o n e stream to an o ther. When the ice ages came, they were there to mo ve tho se salmo n aro un d. When tho se rivers were blo cked ( such as what hap p en ed o n the Fraz ier River in 1 9 1 1 due to lo gjams) , the In dian s made a wo o den flume an d allo wed the salmo n aro un d. Where they co uldn ’t build a flume to the up p er regio n s they wo uld carry the eggs so that tho se salmo n co uld sp awn . They had weirs acro ss the rivers n ear the mo uth o f tho se rivers, an d they wo uld let the salmo n thro ugh o n ce they’d do n e the harvestin g in the mo rn in g. There are man y sto ries like this. They wo uld clean sp awn in g beds fo r the salmo n , they wo uld break up lo gjams o n steep gradien t creeks to allo w the salmo n up , but mo st imp o rtan tly, they didn ’t fish the o p en o cean fo r salmo n o r an adro mo us fish, they fished at the mo uths o f the rivers. By fishin g at the mo uths o f the rivers, the mo uths o f the streams, they co uld co n tro l the harvest, they co uld co n tro l ho w they built their fish trap s an d selected their fishin g ho o ks, an d the siz e an d the sp ecies o f fish they n eeded. The o thers wo uld be let go . If they were circlin g a herd o f elk with fire, as they did in the Willamette Valley in Orego n an d in the San Jo aq uin Valley an d the Sacramen to Valley in Califo rn ia, they’d co n cen trate tho se deer in to a small p lace, then they’d go in an d take the fair to middlin g o n es o ut, n o t the best o n es. They’d let the best go because the In dian p eo p le had a sen se o f gen etics, o f selective breedin g an d selective harvestin g. A to bacco , Nico tia n a q ua dr iva lvis , used to be a very imp o rtan t medicin e p lan t that was so wed o ut in the ashes o f slash at midslo p e in the Klamath Mo un tain s where I live. It is virtually extin ct because n o o n e is do in g that an ymo re. When they burn ed in the Willamette Valley in Orego n , they backburn ed aro un d Do uglas fir an d western hemlo ck gro ves at the edges o f the valley in the fo o thills, so the elk wo uld have thermal co ver in the summer time. All this was co n scio us. There’s a lo t o f academic n o n sen se in the literature these days that asks whether o r n o t In dian s were co n servatio n ists, o r whether they were the first eco lo gists o r n o t. The wo rds co n servatio n an d eco lo gy, as we use them in the Western sen se, do n ’t exactly fit what In dian p eo p le did o r do with the lan d. It was their liveliho o d, which dep en ded o n recip ro city. Thus, the trees were n o t seen just as trees, they were also seen as relatives. The trees are relatives an d o ther sp ecies are relatives an d they watched yo u all the time. It was a fo rest o f eyes that lo o ked at yo u to see ho w yo u were han dlin g the remain s o f p lan ts an d an imals. An an imal’s shado w so ul is alive fo r a lo n g time after an an imal is killed, an d it watches ho w yo u treat the remain s. Amo n g the Ko yuko n in Cen tral Alaska, if yo u came acro ss a mo o se that had already died, an d it was so mewhat deco mp o sed, yo u wo uld still sto p an d cut it in to edible p ieces like yo u wo uld if it were ready to be eaten . Yo u wo uld do this to sho w the shado w so ul that yo u cared fo r an d resp ected that an imal, n o matter ho w it died. Yo u still had to sho w resp ect. That was the agreemen t, the co mp act, between the an imals an d the p eo p le. That’s ho w it wo rked. So what do es that have to do with where we are to day? We co uld go o n an d o n abo ut the co dep en den cy an d the co evo lutio n thro ugh selective harvestin g an d gatherin g between In digen o us Peo p les an d p lan ts an d an imals ( o f co urse, everyo n e’s an cesto rs were o n ce In digen o us) . Nin ety- n in e p ercen t o f o ur human existen ce has been n o n in dustrial, n o n majo r agricultural, it has been hun tin g, gatherin g, an d agro eco lo gy, all mixed up to gether dep en din g o n the seaso n an d the reso urce that n eeded to be exp lo ited. On e recen t autho r claimed that In dian s o n ly o ccup ied 0 .0 2 p ercen t o f No rth America lan d area, so therefo re they didn ’t really man age very much lan d. That’s just where the villages were. But they fo rget that they did seaso n al ro un dup s to the highest elevatio n s, they burn ed at virtually every elevatio n fro m sea level an d fo o thill an d valley all the way acro ss the high p eaks o f the Sierra Nevada an d the Cascades. They traded with their n eighbo rs beyo n d, harvestin g an d burn in g alo n g the way where an d when it was n eeded. Due to this in ten sive an d exten sive man agemen t by In digen o us Peo p les n early everywhere in No rth America—as fo rest eco lo gists, as n ative scien tists, an d en viro n men tal activists—we n eed to reco gn iz e that there is a mo del here. This mo del is a baselin e that we can derive fro m the o ral traditio n an d the literature an d fro m vario us scien tific techn iq ues such as p yro den dro chro n o lo gy ( the readin g o f fire-scar histo ry, which in dicates ho w man y fires o ccurred) . Given that mo st In dian fires set by the wo men in this area did n o t sho w up as fire scars, we can get o n ly a little bit o f an idea abo ut lightn in g freq uen cy data an d even mean return in tervals ( the average times a fire co mes thro ugh in an y given p lace) fro m the scien tific co mmun ity. We n eed to lo o k at what it wo uld have taken fo r In digen o us Peo p le to survive at very high, p reco n tact, p redisease p o p ulatio n s, an d the amo un t o f burn in g that wo uld have been req uired. It wo uld p ro bably be ten times what is curren tly estimated by fo rmal an thro p o lo gy fo r p o p ulatio n n umbers. An en o rmo us n umber o f p lan ts wo uld have to have been burn ed to be able to create ap p ro ximately twelve majo r catego ries o f cultural use. Eighty-five p ercen t o f the p lan ts that were used by In dian p eo p le in Califo rn ia were p lan ts that had been burn ed the year befo re to make them useful fo r basketry, co rdage, fo r ceremo n ies, fo r games, fo r musical in strumen ts, fo r fishin g an d hun tin g gear, fo r structures, fo r clo thin g, medicin e an d fo o d, an d deer an d elk habitat imp ro vemen t. There are two to three hun ts o f deer where I am livin g every year. To make the deer fo rage co rrectly, the habitat is burn ed to make it suitable fo r wildlife. By co mbin in g In digen o us Kn o wledge an d o ur kn o wledge o f In digen o us lan d p ractices with Western eco lo gical scien ce, we can create better lan d care. We can then wo rk fro m a referen ce eco system mo del that guides us to the p resen t time. The lan dscap e has chan ged; we have fragmen tatio n , exo tic p lan t in vasio n s, to xic p o llutan ts, an d all that. So it’s n o t that we’re imitatin g the p ast, we can ’t really do that. On ce an eco system is go n e, it’s go n e; that’s why co n servatio n is always the first cho ice.

Denni s Marti nez: Yes, I do , altho ugh n o t as freq uen tly as I wo uld like because so me curves o n ro ads where I live in the wo o ds are p retty dan gero us an d scary, ho wever, to the exten t I can , yes; I carry a sho rt- han dled sho vel in my rig. On e o f the reaso n s I do that is because birds like raven s an d cro ws an d magp ies will co me to feed o n the carcasses an d then they’ll get hit by cars co min g aro un d curves. I wish I co uld take mo re dead an imals fro m the curves; so metimes I’ll walk back a blo ck o r two to do that. Seco n d, it’s a resp ectful way to ho n o r the remain s o f that bird o r an imal. As I men tio n ed earlier, it’s ho w yo u treat an an imal’s remain s that co un ts. In the p ast, p eo p le didn ’t just thro w thin gs away willy-n illy. They didn ’t p ut them in the garbage can , they p ut tho se bo n es carefully up in the kn o t- cro tches o f trees. They had a way o f dealin g with remain s.

We co n sider wildlife to be p eo p le just like us, with the same kin d o f p sycho lo gy as us.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WITH ENRIQUE SALMÓN En riq ue Salmó n : Cuir a -b a ! ( Greetin gs in Rará muri) . That’s my Rará muri lan guage ( also kn o wn as Tarahumara) . I start that way because when I thin k abo ut eco lo gical an d In digen o us issues I can ’t help but thin k abo ut ho w we talk abo ut these issues, ho w we talk abo ut the en viro n men t, ho w we talk abo ut traditio n al culture, ho w we talk abo ut o ur o wn co n n ectio n to p lace. Usin g the right wo rds, fin din g the right wo rds, is o ften difficult, because half the time it’s an in tuitive p ro cess that we’re all strugglin g with, tryin g to fin d a way to describe an d exp ress this very deep an d emo tio n al co n n ectio n . Fo r me, it takes me do wn in to the co re o f my bein g, o f bein g a Rará muri —ho w I iden tify myself when I wake up every mo rn in g an d thin k abo ut who I am an d what I am. When I thin k o f bein g a Rará muri, it imp lies a very deep resp o n sibility. Let me tell yo u a sto ry abo ut that. I like to tell sto ries. This is a key way to get en co ded kn o wledge acro ss, an d in this case, eco lo gical kn o wledge. I remember a n umber o f years ago when I was back do wn in Chihuahua where my p eo p le are fro m. It’s the cen ter o f the un iverse, by the way, n o t Marin Co un ty like so me p eo p le like to believe. Altho ugh Marin ’s an in credible p lace. To me it’s beco me ho me. But I was do wn in Chihuahua at the edge o f the Barran ca del Co bre o r what we call in o ur lan guage Ur iq ue. This is a can yo n that is deep er than the Gran d Can yo n , an d yo u can fit three Gran d Can yo n s in to it. An d this is the ho melan d. I was there with so me o f my frien ds in a p lace called No ro gachi an d we were talkin g abo ut go in g to a co mmun ity called Creel, which is the n earest co mmun ity where there’s actually electricity an d run n in g water, an d we were go in g to go do so me thin gs there with so me o f my relatives an d frien ds. That mo rn in g, when we go t up an d wen t to leave, I n o ticed that my frien ds had all chan ged fro m the traditio n al clo thin g in to what we call Western clo thin g. There’s a reaso n fo r this, because when the Rará muri go in to p laces like Creel, where there’s a lo t o f Mé stiz o s an d n o n n ative p eo p le, we o ften get p icked o n an d get beat up an d so metimes even murdered. So it’s to p eo p le’s advan tage to p ut o n Western clo thin g. But I was teasin g my buddies an d sayin g, “Oh, yo u’re n o t Rará muri an ymo re; yo u do n ’t have the clo thin g o n .” So we were teasin g each o ther abo ut that. Then we go t in to o n e car an d it to o k us five ho urs to go fifteen miles o n the sup er highway acro ss the Sierra Madres. We go t to Creel an d we did o ur thin g, an d bein g that there was electricity, there was an ice cream sho p . So we wen t an d had ice cream, an d we came o ut an d we were just sittin g o n the curb eatin g o ur ice cream. Then fro m acro ss the street this traditio n ally dressed Rará muri co mes o ut o f a sho p , an d again , I started teasin g my buddies an d I said, “No w there’s a real Rará muri! ” My buddies said, “No he’s n o t.” I said, “Yeah, lo o k, he has the traditio n al clo thin g o n —the aca’ca, the san dals that we wear an d so o n .” An d he says, “No . He’s a Mo rmo n .” No w, what’s the reaso n that so un ds fun n y? When Mo rmo n missio n aries co me do wn in to No rthern Mexico an d to o ther p laces aro un d the wo rld an d do their missio n o f missio n iz in g, they brin g their beliefs. A p art o f their belief is that when yo u beco me a Mo rmo n , yo u can ’t dan ce an d yo u can ’t drin k. Part o f bein g a Rará muri is dan cin g an d drin kin g, an d n o t just fo r the hell o f it. When we dan ce, we p lay a certain kin d o f music, an d On o ruame o ur creato r, likes to hear this, he likes to watch us dan ce; he likes to hear the music. When we drin k o ur co rn beer, it’s a sacramen t. Our o rigin s are fro m the co rn , we are the children o f co rn . We literally emerged fro m ears o f co rn . So when we drin k co rn beer, we’re beco min g o n e with o ur o rigin s, o n e with o urselves, because we are the co rn , the co rn is us, an d as a result, we are the lan d. When we drin k this co rn beer an d we get drun k o n it, On o ruame likes to hear o ur laughter, an d likes to hear us bein g Rará muri, he gets stro n g, an d he brin gs the rain . An d when the rain co mes, o f co urse, we can gro w thin gs. The lan d is stro n g, the an imals are stro n g. Part o f bein g a Rará muri imp lies dan cin g an d drin kin g an d makin g sure that cycle co n tin ues o n this lan dscap e. This is key to what Den n is was talkin g abo ut when it co mes to In digen o us co mmun ities an d in dividuals o f an y lan dscap e co n n ectin g to their p lace, bein g that this imp lies actio n ; it imp lies a p ractice; it imp lies cen turies o f o bservin g what wo rks. What we o ften thin k o f to day as bein g sacred kn o wledge is just as my frien d Den n is has said—it’s p ractical kn o wledge. This so -called sacred kin d o f secret stuff is just what wo rks. Que dice. Part o f what I used to do as a p ro gram o fficer fo r a p rivate fo un datio n that wo rks with In digen o us co mmun ities an d what I still do as an In digen o us ethn o eco lo gist an d educato r is I go aro un d an d talk with p eo p le abo ut their p laces. In this talkin g I hear all so rts o f histo ry—cultural histo ry —o r what yo u might thin k o f as sto ries: o rigin sto ries. I get to see ceremo n ies an d dan ces an d rituals. This is n o t just abo ut do in g the dan ces an d sin gin g the so n gs fo r to urists. They’re fo r o urselves. They are metap ho rs, they’re mo vin g metap ho rs o f o ur relatio n ship to p lace. When we hear the so n gs, we’re also hearin g these metap ho rs that are mo tivated by exp erien ces with o ur cultural sp aces. Let me see if I can give yo u an examp le. A lo n g time ago in an o ther wo rld there was this wo man that we o ften called Sita; her full n ame was Sitakame. She was a lo usy gambler. She was always lo sin g, an d as a result o f all this lo sin g, she was always an gry an d p eo p le didn ’t like to be aro un d her. So she didn ’t have man y frien ds at all. On e day, On o ruame ap p ro aches her an d just kin d o f tells her, “Hey, I’m tired o f this. We’re go in g to have to chan ge yo u.” Can yo u imagin e Go d co min g alo n g an d tellin g yo u yo u’re n o t go in g to be a human bein g an ymo re, I’m go in g to chan ge yo u in to so methin g else? This is what hap p en ed to Sitakame. Creato r co mes alo n g an d says I’m go in g to chan ge yo u in to so methin g that yo u can be that’s go in g to co n tribute to this co mmun ity, an d he chan ges her in to a tree, which, to day, is referred to as Braz il wo o d. As a result o f her bein g chan ged in to Braz il wo o d, she’s n o w very useful to this co mmun ity because fro m Braz il wo o d we get all so rts o f in credible medicin es, an d a wo o d that we use fo r makin g man y cultural o bjects. No w the who le sto ry, the rest o f the sto ry is: What hap p en s when the Rará muri n o w co me acro ss Braz il wo o d? All these cultural metap ho rs o f p ro p er behavio r are activated in o ur min ds. The way we thin k abo ut an d talk abo ut this p lace is activated, it’s chan ged. The lan dscap e beco mes a mo ral lan dscap e. As we mo ve acro ss the lan dscap e, it’s n o t like we go acro ss thin kin g o f these sto ries all the time, we are rememberin g this sto ry an d that sto ry an d so o n , but it’s just a so rt o f auto matic, subco n scio us co n n ectio n to all these thin gs in o ur en viro n men t, to the p lan ts, to the an imals, to geo grap hic o r geo lo gic fo rmatio n s, an d so o n . As a result, o ur mo rality is directive, o r co mes directly fro m a lan dscap e. Co n seq uen tly, we fin d a way to in teract in a kin d way with o ur lan dscap e ( as Den n is discussed earlier) . All these sustain able ways to man age the lan dscap e co me directly fro m this way o f thin kin g an d talkin g abo ut the lan dscap e. Because this is a livin g kn o wledge, it can ’t be p ut in to a memo ry ban k. We sho uldn ’t be thin kin g abo ut p reservin g this stuff. We o ften read abo ut ho w it’s imp o rtan t to p reserve traditio n al kn o wledge. Well, what’s an o ther wo rd fo r p reserve? We can p ickle it, can ’t we? It’s n o t go o d en o ugh to just p ickle this traditio n al kn o wledge an d p ickle ho w to in teract with the lan dscap e, we n eed to keep the actio n s an d the p ractices alive. When we p reserve an d p ickle, o r do what so me ethn o eco lo gists o r an thro p o lo gists do ( take this kn o wledge) , they have to tran slate it. They have to tran sfo rm the kn o wledge an d they take it o ut o f its co n text. They write abo ut it in o n e o f these jo urn al articles that maybe ten o ther p eo p le are go in g to read, o r un dergrads at a co llege are fo rced to read. Then it gets archived, it gets sto red. The kn o wledge is o ut o f its p lace. It’s the same thin g if we go alo n g an d we take a p icture o f a bun ch o f Navajo s fro m say, the 1 8 7 0 s, an d then we say this is ho w Navajo s always have been an d ho w they always will be, n o t allo win g the co mmun ity, the p eo p le, to be dyn amic, to live, to beco me a livin g co mmun ity. The kn o wledge is also a livin g thin g, an d we have to allo w this to co n tin ue as it is, an d to be creatively chan ged, because, o f co urse, the p eo p le an d the lan d also chan ge. Memo ry ban ks are n o t go in g to do a who le lo t fo r us. There’s n o t much co n text. We have to thin k then , if we’re n o t go in g to sto re o r p ickle o r p reserve this kn o wledge, what’s the altern ative? We always talk abo ut main tain in g o ur bio sp here, o ur bio diversity. But we’ve go t to keep it go in g, an d we’ve go t to make sure it’s alive. What abo ut what Wade Davis calls the ethn o sp here? The sp here o f human creativity an d cultural diversity? In digen o us Peo p les are tryin g to fin d a way to co n tin ue this human legacy o f livin g sustain ably with this lan d, with o ur differen t lan dscap es. Because when we start to lo se the ethn o sp here, we’re lo sin g all o f these cultural tran slatio n s o f sp ecific eco systems. The Lako ta way o f dealin g with their lan dscap e is n o t go in g to wo rk fo r the Ho p i in No rthern Ariz o n a, an d vice versa. We have to p ay atten tio n to the co n text o f their sp ecific mo dels an d their mo ral metap ho rs an d their mo ral lan dscap es, o r what Leslie Marmo n Silko referred to as their co gn itive jo urn eys acro ss a lan dscap e. We all have to fin d o ur un iq ue ways o f takin g o ur o wn co gn itive jo urn eys o n o ur lan dscap es, as the wo man here asked abo ut with this lan d that she has ado p ted. She has to fin d her co gn itive jo urn ey o n that lan dscap e. Den n is suggested a great way to do this: fin d the p lan ts. Co n n ect with them an d then yo ur co gn itive jo urn ey begin s, an d then n ext yo ur metap ho rs will begin , an d that p lace beco mes yo ur mo ral lan dscap e. So , let’s fin d a way to main tain these cultures, in situ, o n their p laces. If the p eo p le o wn lan d, then the lan d will stay healthy. It’s n o t an acciden t that in the mo st bio diverse regio n s aro un d the wo rld, we also fin d traditio n al cultures, p eo p le who are sp eakin g their lan guages, who are main tain in g these sustain able lan d-man agemen t p ractices. So , desp ite what so man y en viro n men tal NGOs have been tellin g us fo r a lo n g time—that human s are bad fo r the lan d—human s are actually go o d fo r the lan dscap e if they fin d this p ro p er behavio r with their lan dscap es, this mo ral behavio r. I kn o w that man y NGOs are chan gin g, I’ll give them that credit. So , what do es this mean fo r us to day when I talk abo ut talkin g abo ut p lace, talkin g abo ut en viro n men t? Why is it that mo st American s, when p o lled, agree that we have majo r en viro n men tal co n cern s that n eed to be addressed? In fact, a lo t o f American s say they are en viro n men talists, yet “en viro n men talist” an d “en viro n men t” have beco me bad wo rds. We have to chan ge o ur lan guage abo ut this issue. We have to sto p talkin g abo ut the en viro n men t. We have to sto p settin g up this barrier, this wall, between what we feel is go o d an d p ro p er behavio r, an d ap p ly it to o ur lan guage, an d take it in to a deep er sen se, a deep er truth, which is what? That we a r e the en viro n men t, an d if we are harmin g the en viro n men t, we’re harmin g o urselves. So , in o ther wo rds, we have to talk abo ut thin gs like glo bal warmin g an d climate chan ge, n o t as an en viro n men tal issue, but as a human health issue. This is what it’s really abo ut. When we can start to do that, we can sto p sep aratin g human s fro m the en viro n men t an d p lace human s smack in the middle o f the en viro n men t, which is n o t just n ative p eo p les, all o f us have to b e the en vir o n men t. We n eed to sto p sep aratin g o urselves fro m what’s in o ur o wn fro n t an d backyards, because we’re all o f that as human bein gs.

It’s n o t like ten tho usan d years ago after the Ice Age, Native Peo p les all wo ke up aro un d the wo rld an d said, “Hey, let’s be eco lo gists n o w.” This is just the way o f livin g o n a p lace. It’s just like I said; it’s a result o f cen turies o f o bservatio n o f what wo rks an d o f reco gn iz in g that we have to be in this p lace so we better n o t make a mess o f thin gs. Questi on: Isn ’t it true that the wo rld’s bio diversity started to go do wn when mo dern human s started to emerge an d develo p ? Enri que Sal món: We have to be careful abo ut that so rt o f thin kin g because bio diversity main tain s a sto chastic co n tin uum. It’s always go in g up o r do wn , it’s n ever in this o n e simp le, harmo n ic state where so methin g reaches a certain n umber an d then stays there. It’s always mo vin g—that’s the histo ry o f this p lan et, an d human bein gs have exp erien ced the same thin g. I thin k I kn o w what yo u’re gettin g at, tho ugh, p artly with Paul Martin an d that research abo ut extin ctio n rates after the Ice Age, an d In digen o us Peo p les havin g a ro le in that. But that’s up fo r debate whether o r n o t that was true, o r whether o r n o t it was actually a co mbin atio n o f human hun tin g, climate chan ge, an d all so rts o f o ther facto rs that affected mammo ths an d o ther large megafaun a. Yo u can ’t den y, ho wever, that in the last hun dred years diversity has p lummeted, an d that’s, o f co urse, a direct result o f mo dern in dustrializ ed so ciety, n o t traditio n al human co mmun ities that still man age their lan dscap e. That’s why I said that, o f the remain in g high bio diversity areas in the wo rld, the In digen o us co mmun ities are there main tain in g tho se traditio n s an d en han cin g their bio diversity, as o p p o sed to decreasin g diversity. Un fo rtun ately, there aren ’t en o ugh o f these traditio n al co mmun ities still aro un d in the wo rld. Denni s Marti nez: I just wan ted to add o n e thin g to that: This idea o f a referen ce resto ratio n mo del fo r scien ce based o n In digen o us man agemen t techn iq ues an d p ractices an d kn o wledge is a relative thin g. Befo re there were human s there was a differen t vegetatio n co n figuratio n structurally an d co mp o sitio n ally in n ature when there were differen t climactic weather regimes. There were differen ces even when human s were here. Over the last six tho usan d years there has gen erally been a co o lin g tren d in climatic regimes. Fire has been used by In digen o us Peo p le to main tain o aks that were retreatin g so uth as the climate co o led. Their burn in g remo ved advan cin g co n ifers like fir, cedar, hemlo ck, an d Do uglas fir, which were disp lacin g o aks. We still have to wo rk hard to keep Do uglas fir o ut o f o ak gro ves. Fire was the main architect, in No rth America, o f the structure an d co mp o sitio n o f fo rest an d p rairie an d wetlan d eco systems, so to the degree that fire has been made illegal o r sup p ressed, bio diversity has suffered tremen do usly. In dian p eo p le were the o n es p rimarily usin g fire, which sup p lemen ted lightn in g fire in so me areas. There were o ther areas where lightn in g fires sup p lemen ted In dian fires. Questi on: What are so me mo dels o f eco lo gical resto ratio n that are bein g successful right n o w in the American So uthwest? What are p eo p le do in g n o w? Ho w can we get in vo lved? Enri que Sal món: On e o f my favo rite mo dels is right here at the Califo rn ia- Ariz o n a bo rder do wn in to the Co lo rado Delta. There’s a co mmun ity o f n ative fo lks that n o t a who le lo t o f p eo p le kn o w are do wn there. They’ve kin d o f kep t themselves q uiet; they’re the Co co p ahs. They live o n bo th sides o f the Mexican -American bo rder, traditio n ally they were there, an d the bo rder just kin d o f came alo n g an d sp lit them up . They are curren tly wo rkin g o n a resto ratio n o f the Delta. They are do in g a co mbin atio n o f dredgin g—because the Delta has silted up an d affected their traditio n al fishin g gro un ds—an d buildin g weirs an d dykes to ho ld the water in certain p laces o r, in o ther wo rds, to lift the level o f the water there in the Delta. This is so methin g that they did befo re. Fo r cen turies they’ve do n e this wo rk to main tain the Delta. So they’re return in g to this way o f man agin g the Delta there an d, as a result, the fish sp ecies are co min g back an d certain sho relin e p lan t sp ecies are return in g. When that hap p en s, o f co urse, the small mammals an d the birds, in sects, an d o ther life, all start to co me an d fall back in to p lace. On ce yo u start to resto re an imp o rtan t p art o f an eco system, what we call the keysto n e sp ecies have to return . This raises a very in terestin g q uestio n , then , in light o f that co n cep t: Are human s a keysto n e sp ecies? Den n is, what do yo u thin k abo ut that? Denni s Marti nez: Human s are keysto n e sp ecies where they have been in vo lved in eco system dyn amics fo r millen n ia, an d even fo r sho rter p erio ds o f time when their actio n s an d p ractices have been eco lo gically ap p ro p riate. Human s are n o t in n ately destructive, in n ately exp lo itive; it has to do with culture, it has to do with a way o f relatin g to the lan d that imp lies bo th sp iritual an d eco lo gical wisdo m, an d this is embo died in Traditio n al Eco lo gical Kn o wledge. It’s ho w we fit in with that, which the fo rest, fo r examp le, is familiar with o ver co evo lutio n ary time. Human s in mo st eco systems in No rth American , an d man y glo bally, have been in timately in vo lved as to p carn ivo res an d as keysto n e sp ecies, an d when they’ve been remo ved fro m tho se p ractices that were eco lo gically ap p ro p riate, systems have ten ded to un ravel an d un in ten ded n egative cascadin g eco lo gical co n seq uen ces have o ccurred. We’re also keysto n e if we’re do in g destructive p ractices, but by chan gin g o ur p ractices, we can have a p o sitive effect o n the eco systems. That is the ro le o f culture an d the In digen o us mo del I’ve been talkin g abo ut. Questi on: The greatest healin g that n eeds to be do n e is the healin g o f this Euro p ean idea o f the sep aratio n o f p eo p le fro m n ature, an d its mo dern co un terp art, which is that human s are bad, an d o ur children n o w are dep ressed abo ut bein g a human because they see what we’re do in g o ut there destructively. Denni s Marti nez: But cultures that p ractice eco lo gically ap p ro p riate p ractices are in a differen t bag alto gether. There is n o In dian wo rd fo r wildern ess. There are wo rds that co rresp o n d to “wild”—that which we do n ’t co n tro l. Wildern ess imp lies a lack o f a relatio n ship , even tho ugh it mean s in its earliest mean in g, “self-willed.” We do n ’t man age n ature, we wo rk with n ature. But we do n ’t co n tro l n ature. In resto ratio n , we n udge n ature just a little bit to assist in reco verin g n atural p ro cesses, just like a do cto r wo uld by usin g medicin e in the human bo dy. It’s a matter o f o ur relatio n ship in a sp iritual sen se. We co me as sup p lican ts, we p ray in ceremo n ies to set the wo rld right because we use it up ; we re-create the wo rld with p lan ts an d an imals. We are co creato rs with the p lan ts an d an imals; an d un like Islam, Judaism, an d Christian ity, Go d did n o t create the earth an d then rest o n the seven th day. Every day is Creatio n . Every day is Earth Day an d ceremo n ies o f wo rld ren ewal are carried o n every year by In digen o us Peo p les wo rldwide. Mel i ssa K. Nel son: I wan t to co mmen t as well that a lin guist, Dan Mo o n - hawk Alfo rd, wro te a wo n derful p ap er called “Go d Is No t a No un in Native America.” That gets to the p o in t that Den n is just made, that Go d is n o t simp ly a tran scen den t, divin e fo rce o r p o wer o utside o f o ur human exp erien ce, o r o utside o f n ature an d after the seven th day he sto p p ed all his creative activities. The divin e o r the sacred is so methin g that’s a verb; it is active, it is a co creative p ro cess that In digen o us Peo p les an d all p eo p les have a right an d o bligatio n to p articip ate in o n a mo men t-to mo men t basis thro ugh o ur actio n s, tho ughts, an d behavio r. That seems to be a very differen t wo rldview fro m the Euro cen tric p ersp ective o f a mo n o theistic Divin ity, o f a sin gle Go d that is a n o un , an autho rity, a thin g that is a tran scen den t en tity sep arate fro m o ur wo rld. That message has great p o wer but as Den n is p o in ted o ut, it do esn ’t n ecessarily help with givin g a p ractical resp o n sibility to all o f creatio n , all o f o ur relatives o n the earth. Denni s Marti nez: It’s n o acciden t that tricksters like co yo te an d raven were o ften a tribe’s o rigin al Creato r because they’re very sn eaky an d they co mbin e bo th the wo rst an d the best in human character. Un fo rtun ately, the Babylo n ian s also had a Go d that co mbin ed tho se two thin gs, but who was basically ign o red when the Jews, the Israelites, were in Babylo n . They cho se to sep arate that o n e Go d that had two faces—in to o n e black Go d an d o n e white Go d, o n e go o d an d o n e evil—an d to this day, just lo o k at the curren t p o litical situatio n . We have the same kin d o f dicho to my facin g the wo rld due to religio us ideo lo gy. Questi on: Are there an y effo rts to day to get back to traditio n al eatin g, to eatin g traditio n al fo o ds, fo o ds that co me n aturally fro m the lan dscap e witho ut the n eed fo r p esticides? Simp ly, what’s bein g do n e to brin g back In digen o us traditio n al fo o ds? Enri que Sal món: Yo u’re sp eakin g my lan guage. This is actually key to an y kin d o f eco lo gical resto ratio n because what is the bo tto m lin e fo r why we wan t to sustain ably live o n an y lan dscap e wherever we are in the wo rld? We have to eat! We do n ’t do it just because it lo o ks go o d. We make these p arks in the fo rests an d we resto re these rivers, the Co lo rado River Delta, an d we wo rk to harmo n iz e with the lan d because it’s all abo ut eatin g. We have to get fo o d to sustain o urselves an d o ur co mmun ities. A key to an y kin d o f resto ratio n is to thin k abo ut the traditio n al diets o f co mmun ities. On ce these diets are return ed to the co mmun ity it mean s that these p eo p le are livin g sustain ably with their en viro n men t. The diet also do es so methin g else then , it’s return in g a fo rm o f n utritio n that is un iq ue to the sp ecific p lace. In digen o us Peo p les aro un d the wo rld have co evo lved with the p lan ts an d the an imals that are in their regio n s. I thin k abo ut, fo r examp le, the first time I had p o tato es directly fro m the An des. I do n ’t kn o w if yo u guys have ever eaten traditio n al p o tato es fro m the An des. Yo u eat a p late o f these thin gs an d yo u wan t to take a lo n g n ap fo r abo ut twen ty ho urs. That’s because they’re so full o f these glyco sides an d o ther n utrien ts that we’re n o t used to eatin g. They have that effect o n us, they literally shut do wn a certain degree o f o xygen in o ur blo o d system, but fo r p eo p le who have co evo lved with these p o tato es, it do esn ’t affect them. This is key, again , to resto rin g In digen o us health, resto rin g the fo o d ways. A lo t o f us kn o w already that here in the Un ited States an d in p arts o f Mexico an d Can ada, as well, diabetes—adult o n set, Typ e II, diabetes—is o ut o f co n tro l. In so me co mmun ities like the Gila River Pima in Ariz o n a, 5 0 p ercen t o f the adults o ver the age o f thirty-five can assume that they’re go in g to die fro m diabetes. This imp act, o f co urse, is ho rren do us o n families an d the co mmun ity at large, the traditio n al kn o wledge we’ve been talkin g abo ut. Diabetes can be easily p reven ted by return in g to a traditio n al diet. Very simp le. But then , o f co urse, we ask, Why do n ’t p eo p le just do that? Well, it’s n o t that easy, because there are all these o ther eco n o mic, so cial, an d p o litical facto rs that just do n ’t allo w this to hap p en . But, fo rtun ately, in o ur case here to day, there are so me o rgan iz atio n s wo rkin g very hard to return at least so me o f the co mmun ities o n the reservatio n to traditio n al fo o d thro ugh traditio n al farmin g metho ds an d by gettin g the yo uth in vo lved in farmin g, an d gettin g the fo o d in to the educatio n al system o n the reservatio n . Fo r examp le, o n the To ho n o O’Odham reservatio n in So uthern Ariz o n a there is a gro up called To ho n o O’Odham Co mmun ity Actio n ( TOCA) that is do in g this so rt o f thin g. It takes these smaller effo rts to even tually reach a tip p in g p o in t an d then it just can ’t be sto p p ed; they take o n a life o f their o wn . An d we have to keep sup p o rtin g it. We can sup p o rt it by tryin g to n o t just eat o rgan ically— eatin g o rgan ically isn ’t en o ugh—we have to eat lo cally. I was talkin g to Melissa’s class yesterday at San Fran cisco State an d I challen ged the studen ts. I said to them, I’d like fo r yo u to cen ter yo urself in San Fran cisco , draw a circle that go es seven ty miles in all directio n s, an d fo r three mo n ths, eat fo o d that o n ly co mes fro m within that circle an d see what hap p en s. If we all co uld do that, imagin e the imp act it wo uld have o n o ur health an d o n the p lan et. Denni s Marti nez: Frybread is great, it tastes really go o d but frybread is p ure p o iso n if eaten all the time. Frybread is an examp le o f p eo p le adap tin g to what is available; makin g lemo n ade o ut o f lemo n s because the USDA co mmo dities have been o n e o f the wo rst an d mo st destructive thin gs that have hap p en ed to reservatio n s sin ce the 1 9 5 0 s. At that time an d in so me p arts even to day, all that the go vern men t gave In dian s to eat o n reservatio n s was white flo ur, white sugar, dairy p ro ducts, an d can n ed fo o ds. Questi on: When yo u talk abo ut resto ratio n an d yo u reco gn iz e that lan dscap es an d cultures are co n stan tly adap tin g an d chan gin g o ver time to n ew thin gs that co me aro un d, then there’s n o set p o in t, o r sp ecific time, fo r resto ratio n to go back to . Tryin g to go back to a certain time o f cultural p ractices o r a certain time o f eco lo gical fun ctio n s assumes stability in the system, an d is that sustain able? Denni s Marti nez: The an swer is n o , in my view it do es n o t assume stability. We have relative stability. We do n ’t wan t, fo r examp le, fo rests to gro w up an d get burn ed do wn every thirty years—they used to get burn ed do wn every 1 5 0 to 3 0 0 years—because we’re n o t creatin g the fire that we n eed to relieve the fuel buildup . We o n ly have, in a sen se, a mo vin g p ho to grap h o r video , as o p p o sed to a still p ho to grap h o f the p ast, so we’re lo o kin g at the flo w o r eco lo gical trajecto ry an d we’re tryin g to cap ture it as best we can in its mo st salien t an d characteristic asp ects. Fo r examp le, ho w man y trees were there p er acre? What kin ds o f sp ecies were do min an t? What was the fo rest structure? What were the keysto n e sp ecies? We’re tryin g to get tho se back. The system fun ctio n s o n its o wn o n ce we n udge it a little bit in that directio n , but we do n ’t resto re back to a set time an d exp ect it to stay there. I do n ’t kn o w an y resto ratio n eco lo gist who believes that. It’s a co mmo n en viro n men tal p hilo so p her’s critiq ue o f p ractitio n ers in resto ratio n , but they’re gen erally n o t p ractitio n ers, an d that makes a huge differen ce. So , it’s all relative, it co n tin ues to evo lve. We wan t the rate o f chan ge, the kin d o f chan ge, an d the in ten sity o f chan ge to be within the histo rical ran ge o f variability o f ho w eco systems have evo lved an d co evo lved with p eo p le. When it exceeds that rate, then there’s an eco lo gical an d a cultural p ro blem. Cultures can ’t adap t fast en o ugh to the chan ges. Fo rests can n o t adap t fast en o ugh to the chan ges either. So with p eo p le an d trees, it’s the same idea. We n eed to adap t the same slo w p ace o f chan ge thro ugh resto ratio n . That’s why we use a histo rical mo del as a guide, but we do n ’t en tirely stay there, because so much has chan ged. To p ut it an o ther way, we do n ’t set back the eco lo gical clo ck. We reset the co evo lutio n ary clo ck so that it may run again at its o p timum rate. That’s the bro ad evo lutio n ary trajecto ry we ho p e to n udge back in to p lace. In digen o us cultures have always had to adap t to chan ged co n ditio n s— remember the ice ages, great flo o ds, warmin g o r co o lin g climates? As my frien d En riq ue n o ted, usin g a sn o wmo bile do esn ’t make yo u less o f a hun ter. What we wan t to see hap p en is the resto ratio n o f the co evo lutio n ary an d co adap tive ro le between culture an d n ature at the ap p ro p riate temp o ral an d sp atial scales o f the earth’s o wn schedule. Questi on: En riq ue emp hasiz ed lan guage an d ho w we talk abo ut lan dscap e. Do academics o r lin guists who study differen t lan guages begin to talk differen tly abo ut the lan d o r n ature based o n their study o f all the vario us lan guages? Enri que Sal món: First, if lin guists are go in g to p ay atten tio n to lan guage, they n eed to n o t remo ve it fro m its co n text. That’s usually the first thin g that hap p en s: They take the lan guage an d they treat it like it’s just a sto re o f data, o f wo rds, an d so me grammatical structure. Then it gets p laced in to so me so rt o f in terp retive mo del, an d it’s n o t allo wed to gro w o r chan ge. I thin k lin guists n eed to sto p do in g that. It has to beco me an actio n o r p ractice to sto p takin g these lan guages o ut o f co n text. An d what do es that mean , then ? That mean s fin din g a way to keep the lan guage alive in the sp eakers themselves. Mel i ssa K. Nel son: There are actually man y imp o rtan t n ative effo rts un derway to wo rk with In digen o us lan guages in No rth America. On e excitin g mo del o f In digen o us lan guage wo rk is co min g fro m an o rgan iz atio n called Advo cates fo r In digen o us Califo rn ia Lan guage Survival ( AICLS) . Rather than the usual an thro p o lo gical mo del where In dian lan guage keep ers are co n sulted an d reco rded by lin guists, it is the reverse situatio n . Grassro o ts In digen o us lan guage advo cates are emp lo yin g an d co n sultin g with academic lin guists to assist them in reco verin g their lan guage un der their terms. There is a bian n ual co n feren ce, “Breath o f Life: Silen t No Mo re,” at UC Berkeley, o rgan iz ed by AICLS an d ho sted in p art by their lin guistics dep artmen t, where traditio n al Elders an d p rimarily Califo rn ia In dian lan guage learn ers co me to gether to revitaliz e their lan guages. In man y cases, the Elders that co me are the last sp eakers o f their lan guage, o r their lan guage has been “extin ct” fo r decades. So metimes there may be o n ly fo ur o r five Elders in their sixties an d seven ties who have a fluen t un derstan din g o f their lan guage. AICLS also sp o n so rs what’s called a Master Ap p ren ticeship Pro gram, which man y tribes an d o rgan iz atio n s use, to p artn er a fluen t Elder with a tribal lan guage learn er. Also at the Berkeley co n feren ce these Elders an d learn ers wo rk with a lin guist. The lin guist wo rks fo r the n ative master an d ap p ren tice, an d they go thro ugh ethn o grap hic n o tes, they go thro ugh lin guistic n o tes, an d they create dictio n aries an d vo cabularies. It’s a great examp le o f grassro o ts In digen o us lan guage keep ers an d advo cates wo rkin g with lin guists in a n ew, mo re balan ced way. If scho lars wan t their wo rk to be relevan t o r useful to co mmun ities, then academics n eed checks an d balan ces by affected co mmun ities an d esp ecially by In digen o us Kn o wledge keep ers. Denni s Marti nez: On e thin g to add to Melissa’s co mmen ts, an d this is n o t usually tho ught abo ut in resp ect to the p reservatio n o f lan guage: We n eed eco n o mies in o ur wildlan ds that will keep tribal p eo p le in their lo cal co mmun ities lo n g en o ugh fo r the kids to keep the lan guage an d keep the kn o wledge, an d main tain the co n n ectio n between the Elders an d the yo uth. So when I wo rk in fo restry in the Pacific No rthwest in Can ada an d the Un ited States, I emp hasiz e small-diameter thin n in g, n iche markets, n o n timber p ro ducts—thin gs that the tribe agrees can be co mmercializ ed, kn o win g there are thin gs that can ’t an d sho uldn ’t be co mmercializ ed. We exp lo re all tho se areas. Thus, we n eed jo bs in the wo o ds, n o t o n ly fo r In dian p eo p le to keep that co n n ectio n , but also fo r the n o n -In dian , rural lifestyle, which is n o w disap p earin g as Wal-Marts co me in an d the to urist service in dustry tries to have its way.

The to p o grap hy o f o ur lan d is such that the village itself, the p ueblo is right in the valley an d everythin g else go es up . Albuq uerq ue is up stream fro m us so we get everythin g that co mes o ut o f the city o f Albuq uerq ue, in cludin g bad air an d bad water an d man y times, bad p eo p le. So this is what we are dealin g with in o ur co mmun ity at Isleta. Isleta Pueblo an d the Pueblo p eo p le in gen eral are a very traditio n al p eo p le. I guess we co n sider o urselves to be so me o f the mo re traditio n al o f the tribes in the n atio n . There are o ver five hun dred tribes in the Un ited States an d there are n in eteen p ueblo s in New Mexico , startin g with Tao s Pueblo at the n o rth an d en din g at the so uthern p o rtio n o f Pueblo Co un try lan d that is Isleta Pueblo . So we’re the so uthern mo st p ueblo an d we get it all. Startin g in the 1 5 0 0 s an d afterward, o utsiders were amazed to see there were hun dreds o f villages in New Mexico at that time. To day, there are o n ly n in eteen . The traditio n al structure o f the co mmun ity was very stro n g. Our religio n had to go un dergro un d when the Euro p ean s came because o f the Catho licism that they bro ught. They were tryin g to get rid o f all the “p agan s an d the heathen s” an d tryin g to Christian ize everyo n e. So o ur religio us p ractice wen t un dergro un d basically. That is p ro bably the reaso n why o ur religio n is so stro n g to day an d it is very stro n g. It’s amazin g the kin ds o f thin gs that go o n in o ur p ueblo co mmun ities that o ur n eighbo rs are just n o t aware o f, very sacred an d religio us ceremo n ies that o ccur thro ugho ut the year. In Sep tember we p erfo rm a mo n th-lo n g ceremo n y in Isleta Pueblo , which is a co mbin atio n o f the eq uin o x ceremo n y that is leadin g us in to fall an d win ter, an d also a harvest ceremo n y. This p articular mo n th-lo n g ceremo n y culmin ates with dan cin g that is o p en to the p ublic. Mo st o f o ur ceremo n ies are n o t o p en to the p ublic. This ceremo n y also culmin ates with clean sin g an d bathin g in the river an d also in gestin g river water at the clo sin g ceremo n y. This is a little bit o f backgro un d that will help yo u un derstan d what’s go in g o n in Isleta with o ur water issues. Yo u’ll be able to see where Isleta is co min g fro m with this issue o f challen gin g the state o f New Mexico , the city o f Albuq uerq ue, an d the Un ited States fo r clean water. In 1 9 8 6 I was elected go vern o r o f the Pueblo o f Isleta. At that time we had two majo r agen das, o n e o f them was to begin to address the go vern men tal in frastructure o f the tribe an d the o ther o n e was to address health an d en viro n men tal issues. Mo stly because o f where we’re lo cated geo grap hically in referen ce to the city o f Albuq uerq ue, we began to co llect data with the assistan ce, very limited assistan ce, o f the Bureau o f In dian Affairs (BIA), an d also fro m the In dian Health Service (IHS), again , very limited assistan ce fro m them. We en ded up havin g to go o ut an d seek exp erts to assist us. We had to get p eo p le to vo lun teer fo r us an d do p ro bo n o wo rk fo r us to co llect the kin d o f data that we n eeded to begin to build a database to use fo r co mp ariso n p urp o ses as this agen da p ro gressed. Also adjacen t to the reservatio n , right o n o ur n o rth bo un dary, is San dia Natio n al Labo rato ries an d Kirtlan d Air Fo rce Base. San dia Natio n al Labo rato ries has been in vo lved o ver the years with differen t kin ds o f n uclear exp erimen tatio n an d the develo p men t o f weap o n s usin g radio active materials. Aro un d 1 9 8 9 –1 9 9 0 , the San dia Natio n al Labo rato ries ap p ro ached the Albuq uerq ue Co un cil, req uestin g them to amen d their wastewater q uality stan dards to allo w fo r mo re lo w-level radio active waste to en ter the Rio Gran de. Bein g that we’re two in ches fro m the Albuq uerq ue lin e, that water is immediately go in g to en ter o ur reservatio n . Besides that, which we felt was a very serio us situatio n , we’re already dealin g with all the wastewater that co mes o ut o f Albuq uerq ue. The waste treatmen t facility p lan t that services all o f Albuq uerq ue is lo cated six miles n o rth o f o ur reservatio n an d dump s right in to the river, which co mes immediately o n to the reservatio n . Our co mmun ity is a farmin g co mmun ity an d o ur p eo p le have made their livin g fo r man y cen turies fro m farmin g, so we were lo o kin g at the effects o f that water co min g in to the river, in to o ur irrigatio n can als, in to o ur ditches, waterin g o ur fo o d, an d even tually gettin g in to the fo o d chain . We started with a majo r effo rt o f co mmun ity educatio n . Tho ugh man y n ative p eo p le are sen sitive to “en viro n men tal issues” like everyo n e else, we ten d to take o ur en viro n men t fo r gran ted. Our o lder p eo p le esp ecially have a hard time un derstan din g that when yo u turn o n the tap water an d it’s co min g o ut clear that it’s n o t n ecessarily clean , that there might be so methin g bad in there. So we started havin g a n umber o f water fairs an d tryin g to brin g awaren ess up in o ur co mmun ity because we n eeded that sup p o rt, because we were go in g to be co n fro n tin g the city o f Albuq uerq ue, which is a city that’s n o t used to bein g co n fro n ted by a little tribe. I thin k o ur effo rts made them awaken to the fact that there was a tribe that existed right do wn the ro ad fro m them. We have man y p eo p le co min g in to the Albuq uerq ue area fro m o utside the state, a lo t o f eastern ers. I thin k they take the state o f New Mexico fo r gran ted. That’s o n e o f the p ro blems we’re facin g an d we’re gettin g the backlash fro m it, tho se o f us who have been here fo rever. We made co n tact with the Albuq uerq ue Co un cil an d in vited them do wn to Isleta Pueblo to meet with us o n a go vern men t-to - go vern men t basis. I thin k it was really a learn in g exp erien ce fo r them. They n ever had to deal with a tribe an d I do n ’t thin k they really reco gn ized o r un dersto o d the who le issue o f tribal so vereign ty an d tribal jurisdictio n . Therefo re, I believe it was a real learn in g exp erien ce fo r all o f us. We had do n e a lo t o f wo rk in terms o f un derstan din g an d learn in g abo ut en viro n men tal q uality, water q uality, an d we go t in to so me techn ical, scien tific areas. We learn ed a lo t, but we wan ted to make sure we had o ur ho mewo rk do n e when we sat at the table with the co un cil members. Our p lan an d o ur go al was to establish water q uality stan dards fo r the Pueblo o f Isleta that wo uld exceed, certain ly n o t o n ly the city’s water q uality stan dards but also the state’s—an d everyo n e else’s fo r that matter. We were able to get that o p p o rtun ity when there were so me amen dmen ts made to the Clean Water Act, which gave the tribes an o p p o rtun ity to address an d establish water q uality stan dards o n their lan ds. We p ursued that p ro cess, wo rkin g very clo sely with the En viro n men tal Pro tectio n Agen cy (EPA), Regio n 6 . They gave us so me mo n ey to do so me mo del p ro jects an d we even tually wo rked o ur way to establishin g water q uality stan dards fo r o ur co mmun ity. Our water q uality stan dards were drin kin g-water safe. Because o f the high stan dard, Albuq uerq ue’s hair sto o d up because they tho ught we were o ut o f o ur min ds to establish a water q uality stan dard that was so strict. It was certain ly strategic o n o ur p art. Why start an y lo wer than that? They were go in g to try to p o un d us do wn an yway so we figured we might as well start at the highest level that we co uld. The state o f New Mexico , in terestin gly en o ugh, did n o t sup p o rt the city o f Albuq uerq ue. Albuq uerq ue ran cryin g to San ta Fe askin g fo r so me sup p o rt fro m the state legislato rs to fight the In dian s because they were gettin g crazy do wn there askin g fo r clean water. The state refused to get in vo lved an d said, “Hey, yo u guys better learn ho w to deal with tho se In dian s do wn there because they are assertin g their so vereign ty an d they have that right. They’ve been gran ted that autho rity by EPA an d that’s yo ur p ro blem. Yo u deal with them.” It was help ful to us that the state wasn ’t willin g to deal with us at that p o in t either so it gave us a bit mo re stren gth in dealin g with the city o f Albuq uerq ue. We have a n umber o f issues that we’re dealin g with besides the radio active “lo w-level” issue—I’m n o t sure what that mean s. It’s all the same level, as far as we’re co n cern ed. What’s the differen ce if it has a half- life o f a millio n years o r ten tho usan d? We had to get p o litically savvy an d p ublic-relatio n s-wise. We were able to get sup p o rt fro m all the lo cal go vern men ts so uth o f us an d, as a matter o f fact, man y o f the lo cal go vern men ts n o rth o f us also gave us sup p o rt thro ugh reso lutio n s an d letters that we used as we sat an d talked with the city o f Albuq uerq ue an d also with EPA. It to o k us eighteen mo n ths to get William Riley to co me to Isleta Pueblo an d visit us. We asked him to take a swim with us! He fin ally realized that we were right. We do n eed to clean up the Rio Gran de. He sen t a team o f p eo p le in their white suits to Isleta a few weeks later an d they did a bun ch o f so il testin g an d water testin g. We were very hap p y abo ut that, but it was in terestin g in that we had to go thro ugh so much tro uble, an d it to o k us so lo n g to be able to get them do wn here to listen to o ur n eeds. It was really kin d o f dishearten in g that we had to go thro ugh all that tro uble just to be heard. Man y tribes o ut there are sittin g in the same situatio n we are in terms o f their lo catio n n ear a city o r a facility that discharges to xin s in to their area. They do n o t always have the wherewithal o r the p o litical kn o w-ho w to be able to get the p o wers-that-be to co me to their lan ds to lo o k at the p ro blem directly. So they kin d o f get byp assed. On e o f the thin gs that we are do in g in Isleta is tryin g to share that in fo rmatio n with o ther tribes, with the ho p e o f help in g them wo rk with EPA an d the state go vern men ts to get them to p ay atten tio n to these en viro n men tal co n cern s that tribes have. Pro bably within the last ten years o r so , tribes are fin ally begin n in g to assert their so vereign ty an d assert that we are dealin g with the states o n a go vern men t-to -go vern men t basis. We do co n sider o urselves in dep en den t n atio n s. If the feds o we us so methin g, if the Un ited States o wes us so methin g, that’s their p ro blem. We are go in g to ho ld them to their trust resp o n sibility to tribes an d to treaties they sign ed an d it is time that tribes ho ld the feet o f the federal go vern men t to the fire. We were here first so we have been victimized by a lo t o f bad stuff that has co me do wn p o litically, en viro n men tally, so cially, an d in a n umber o f differen t ways. The city o f Albuq uerq ue filed a lawsuit again st the EPA fo r ap p ro vin g o ur water q uality stan dards. There was also a mayo r’s race go in g o n at that time in Albuq uerq ue so that p ut everythin g o n ho ld fo r a while. They were waitin g to fin d o ut who their n ew mayo r was an d see what directio n he wo uld take in either wo rkin g with o r fightin g with the Pueblo o f Isleta o n this water issue. The mayo r o f Albuq uerq ue, at that time, was n ever seen at Isleta Pueblo . We had in vited him a n umber o f times to o ur meetin gs an d o ur sit- do wn sessio n s to talk abo ut these issues an d he refused to meet with us. When he filed the lawsuit again st EPA o n behalf o f Albuq uerq ue, he to o k it to the City Co un cil because he n eeded their ap p ro val fo r fun ds to file tho se lawsuits. The City Co un cil refused to give him an y mo n ey to p ursue that litigatio n . So we were real p leased abo ut that an d than kfully that p ut everythin g o n ho ld fo r a while. We ho p e that n ew mayo rs an d p o litical leaders, who ever they are, will be willin g to wo rk with the p ueblo o n o ur water q uality co n cern s. Right n o w, we have radio active iso to p es go in g in to the river. We have sto rm run o ff, o r n o n p o in t so urce p o llutio n , which the city o f Albuq uerq ue is sayin g they are n o t resp o n sible fo r. The city o f Albuq uerq ue claimed that they were o n ly resp o n sible fo r 2 p ercen t o f the p o llutio n that go es in to the river. We co n ten d that that’s a very lo w p ercen tage an d we assert that it’s actually much higher than that. The city was basically tryin g to get o ut o f the liability o f havin g to clean it up fo r everybo dy up stream. In February o f 1 9 9 3 the Pueblo o f Isleta received what’s called “Treatmen t as State Status” fro m the En viro n men tal Pro tectio n Agen cy. That gives the Pueblo o f Isleta p ermittin g autho rity fo r an yo n e up stream who wishes to discharge in to the Rio Gran de. That p uts the Pueblo o f Isleta in a very p o werful p o sitio n . It also p uts us in a p o sitio n o f great resp o n sibility because we have to set up an in frastructure that can en fo rce the stan dard that we have established. On e day in the Albuq uerq ue p ap ers they had headlin es that said, “Isleta Pueblo ’s water q uality stan dards are go in g to co st the City o f Albuq uerq ue $1 5 0 millio n to co mp ly with.” The n ext day, the same headlin e was used excep t it wen t up an o ther $1 0 0 millio n do llars, so it was $2 5 0 millio n that the city was claimin g it was go in g to co st them to clean up the water. Our reactio n to that was, “Jeez, if it’s go in g to co st that much, then it must really, really be filthy, so yeah, we n eed to have it do n e!” The Rio Gran de is the life so urce in New Mexico . It is the biggest waterway that run s thro ugh the state. Water is a scarce co mmo dity in the so uthwest. Man y p eo p le in the so uthwest—in the state o f New Mexico — make their livin g fro m farmin g. So mebo dy’s go t to stan d up an d fight fo r that. So mebo dy’s go t to do it an d if it mean s a little bitty tribe that man y p eo p le have n ever heard o f, if that’s who ’s go t to do it, then that’s who ’s go t to do it. So we’ve been o ut there fightin g fo r sup p o rt. All the tribes in New Mexico are sup p o rtin g o ur effo rt. Man y o f the little to wn s an d co mmun ities are sup p o rtin g o ur effo rt an d we’re lo o kin g fo r a lo n g, drawn -o ut battle. The in terestin g p art o f o ur fight with the city o f Albuq uerq ue was that n o t o n ly did we assert that it’s detrimen tal to the health an d en viro n men t o f o ur p eo p le an d o ur co mmun ity, we also bro ught fo rth the issue o f religio us freedo m. We have an n ual ceremo n ies at Isleta Pueblo that req uire immersio n an d in gestio n o f the river water. We have a n umber o f o ther very sacred ceremo n ies that also req uire in gestio n o f that water o r to immerse in it. Pro bably fo r the last ten o r fifteen years o ur religio us Elders have been very co n cern ed that the water is to o dan gero us to drin k. This became even mo re o f a reality fo r us when we learn ed what’s go in g in to that water fro m the labs an d the ho sp itals an d also fro m San dia Labs, which is a lo t o f lo w-level radio active waste. This makes it very un safe to even go in to the water, much less drin k it, o r eat an y o f the fish that are in there. It’s a p ersp ective that hasn ’t been bro ught fo rth befo re. I thin k that the EPA o fficials that were at the table with us the day that we bro ught this issue o ut were just flabbergasted. They co uldn ’t believe it an d asked, “What are yo u talkin g abo ut, religio us freedo m? This is a n ew idea. We’ve n ever heard o f it. What are yo u talkin g abo ut?” What we were sayin g is if we can ’t drin k the water we can n o t co mp lete o ur ceremo n ies because the water is n o t clean . If we can ’t drin k it because o f all the to xin s in it, then o ur religio us freedo m is bein g imp in ged up o n . It’s bein g in frin ged up o n . We can n o t co mp lete o ur ceremo n ies the way we sho uld. An d that is a very serio us situatio n fo r In dian p eo p le. Havin g been bro ught up as a Catho lic, it is like go in g to church an d n o t bein g able to have Ho ly Co mmun io n because so mebo dy dro p p ed the ho st in the to ilet bo wl an d yo u can ’t eat it. It’s so methin g like that. I am n o t tryin g to be sacrilegio us, altho ugh the Pueblo o f Isleta did thro w o ut their Catho lic p riest in 1 9 6 5 in han dcuffs. Isleta Pueblo has always been kn o wn to be a little bit o n the radical side, if yo u will. What hap p en ed in Isleta durin g that time is n o t un usual in terms o f what o ther tribes thin k o f Isleta an d ho w far they’ll go to get thin gs do n e. So we’re real p leased abo ut that. We’re still o ut lo o kin g fo r as much exp ertise an d techn ical assistan ce as we can get. We do have a n umber o f educated p eo p le in Isleta Pueblo . We are very p ro ud to say that we have five o r six tribal members who are atto rn eys, who have been do in g a lo t o f p ro bo n o wo rk fo r us an d we have man y n atio n al o rgan izatio n s that have vo lun teered to help us o ut with o ur effo rt. Man y tribes thro ugho ut the co un try were lo o kin g at Isleta Pueblo because o f this cuttin g-edge, p receden t-settin g situatio n . What hap p en ed at Isleta—assertin g o ur religio us freedo m an d water rights—has p o sitively affected man y tribes thro ugho ut the co un try. We have a lo t o f o ther tribes in New Mexico that are also bein g threaten ed in vario us ways. We have several tribes that sit right belo w Lo s Alamo s Labo rato ries. We all kn o w what hap p en ed at Lo s Alamo s an d what’s still hap p en in g there. They’re fin din g mo re an d mo re to xin s that have leached in to the water, bo th surface an d subsurface waters, an d it’s really scary. All that is co min g do wn . We’re hearin g abo ut all kin ds o f thin gs go in g o n in so uthern Co lo rado with the o ld min es. All that stuff is leachin g an d everythin g go es do wn , so Isleta Pueblo is even tually go in g to be gettin g a lo t o f that. We’ve wo rked with p eo p le all the way do wn to Mexico an d we’ve go tten a lo t o f sup p o rt fro m them an d we’re ho p in g to co n tin ue that relatio n ship un til we turn New Mexico aro un d an d wo rk with p eo p le who are co n cern ed abo ut the en viro n men t. I ho p e that we will be able to turn it aro un d. The Pueblo o f Isleta p ushed fo r this sign ifican t effo rt that we called Native American 2 0 0 0 . It was a lo n g-term ap p ro ach to addressin g the issue o f en viro n men tal q uality. We in tegrated an en viro n men tal p ro gram in to o ur elemen tary scho o l. We have o n e scho o l o n the reservatio n that’s kin dergarten thro ugh sixth grade. Thereafter o ur children go to p ublic scho o l in Albuq uerq ue o r in an o ther little to wn so uth o f us. We’re ho p in g to build a high scho o l o n the reservatio n an d keep o ur children o n the reservatio n an d begin to start teachin g abo ut the en viro n men t, p lan n in g, an d teamwo rk. All tho se kin ds o f thin gs that o ur yo un g p eo p le n eed to be skilled in to co n tin ue this wo rk fo r us fo r the n ext twen ty-five o r thirty years, which is p ro bably ho w lo n g it’s go in g to take us to clean up the waterways in o ur area. We’re lo o kin g at that ho p efully as a viable target time frame. We’ll be wo rkin g clo sely with tribes thro ugho ut the co un try. We’re gettin g to gether with an o rgan izatio n called Win driver Asso ciates. They’re o ut o f Wyo min g. They’re also do in g a n umber o f train in g sessio n s fo r tribes an d we’re wo rkin g with tribes right n o w tryin g to p ro vide them with a kin d o f ho w-to man ual fo r ho w to wo rk with EPA an d the state an d federal go vern men ts to address so me o f these en viro n men tal q uality issues. It’s a big task. It’s been in terestin g fo r tribes to have to in tegrate that who le techn o lo gical p ersp ective an d the jargo n an d everythin g else that go es alo n g with bein g real scien tific abo ut it. In dian p eo p le have always been mo re sp iritual abo ut it, so we’re tryin g to establish that balan ce fo r o urselves also , an d then sharin g the sp iritual p art with everybo dy else that’s techn ical abo ut it, if yo u will. We’re ho p in g to create a balan ce. The en viro n men tal issue is a very sp iritual o n e. It takes an un derstan din g an d a reco gn itio n that water, an d all n atural reso urces, are really sp irits. In dian p eo p le reco gn ize that an d so when tho se sp irits are wo un ded o r so iled, then it is very much a degradatio n o f that sp irit. Mo reo ver, we are all go in g to p ay an d we are all p ayin g fo r it n o w. Therefo re, it is very imp o rtan t that we reco gn ize the p o wer o f these sp irits. We have n o co n tro l o ver them. They are very p o werful an d if we’re n o t really careful ho w we treat them, we may be seein g so me very serio us en d to us, because the sp irits can o n ly p ut up with so much, an d we have to be very careful to wo rk with them. They are very real. Native Peo p les reco gn ize this an d I thin k after a lo n g time o f bein g un dergro un d, esp ecially in the p ueblo s with o ur religio n an d o ur sacred beliefs, we are fin ally begin n in g to beco me a little bit mo re o p en abo ut it an d begin n in g to share it a little mo re, because we are fin din g that it’s very imp o rtan t that the wo rld reco gn izes the sp irituality o f it all. This p resen tatio n to o k p lace at the Bio n eers Co n feren ce in 1 9 9 3 . 1 4 The A rt of Thriving in P lace Jo hn Mo hawk First I wan t to state that it is my o p in io n that Native American studies as a discip lin e an ticip ates that there is an in telligen ce in the cultures o f the In digen o us Peo p les o f the Americas, an d that it’s an in telligen ce that can be disco vered. This is co mp letely co n trary to the exp ectatio n s o f the n in eteen th cen tury, when it was tho ught that there was n o real in telligen ce in these cultures. I wan t to begin this discussio n by talkin g abo ut ho w to see this wo rld, because p eo p le can get a view o f it. I wo uld reco mmen d that when yo u go o n yo ur In tern et an d do a little bro wsin g, yo u take a min ute o r two an d typ e in the key wo rds “sn o wball earth.” Because when yo u do this, websites co me up that have a discussio n abo ut o ur p lan et six hun dred millio n years ago . Man y scien tists believe that there was a time when the who le o f the p lan et was co vered with ice, q uite deep ice. Fo r tho se in the go vern men t who do n ’t believe in glo bal warmin g, the big q uestio n is, ho w did the earth escap e this ice? The an swer, they thin k, was that vo lcan o es erup ted o ver millio n s o f years an d the vo lcan o es sp ewed fo rth what we n o w call green ho use gases, an d the green ho use gases even tually heated up the earth, an d the earth melted the ice, an d we began to have the who le p ro cess kick in to gear. There was a great flo urishin g o f evo lutio n that to o k p lace in the millio n s o f years fo llo win g the meltdo wn , an d it to o k us to the p lace where we can almo st imagin e what the wo rld might have lo o ked like so lo n g ago . Then there came an o ther mo men t when it is believed that a sp ecies, o ur sp ecies, radiated o ut o f so mewhere. No w, I’m go in g to leave o p en where it radiated fro m. So me p eo p le wan t to say it radiated fro m Africa. Wherever it radiated fro m tho ugh, it reached a p o in t where there were so man y p eo p le co n cen trated in so me areas that it was n o lo n ger p o ssible fo r hun ter- gatherers to keep radiatin g. So methin g must have hap p en ed to cause this to o ccur, an d o ur best bet is it was climate chan ge; p ro bably a mo re arid climate fo rced p eo p le to co n sider tryin g to co n tro l their o wn fo o d sup p ly. So there was so methin g that hap p en ed in ap p ro ximately 5 0 0 0 BCE that caused p eo p le to co n sider the p o ssibility o f do mesticatin g p lan ts an d an imals. These p eo p le were settled in a p lace an d they co uld n o lo n ger migrate to an o ther p lace because that o ther p lace was already o ccup ied. Here starts the kin d o f sto ry we n eed to thin k abo ut. There is a p redilectio n in o ur sp ecies, yo u co uld call it o ur p rimate in stin cts, that has gro up s o f us fo rever aggressively lo o kin g at the p o ssibility o f exp an din g an d takin g o ver an d p lun derin g o thers. Fro m the begin n in g un til n o w the who le o f civilizatio n hasn ’t very successfully addressed this sho rtco min g. Man y p eo p le believe that civilizatio n has been a mo vemen t fro m o ur lo west p o ten tial to o ur highest p o ten tial, yet it seems to me that the histo ry o f o ur do mesticatio n o f p lan ts an d an imals fo r fo o d p ro ves that that’s n o t en tirely accurate. What hap p en ed was that we cho se—so mebo dy cho se—to do mesticate p lan ts, but this has p ro blems asso ciated with it. Fo r o n e thin g, yo u can o n ly do mesticate the p lan ts that allo w themselves to be do mesticated; yo u can ’t do mesticate all p lan ts. When yo u begin this p ro cess o f do mesticatio n , it mean s that o f the o n e hun dred o r so p lan ts that yo u were used to eatin g, o n ly three o r fo ur subject themselves very well to do mesticatio n . So yo u’ve actually reduced yo ur cho ices o f what to eat, as it were. Yo u did it because there wasn ’t en o ugh fo o d to eat so it was kin d o f a desp erate measure. Yet it will turn o ut that the p lan ts that yo u have p lan ted in yo ur garden have their o wn agen da, as all p lan ts do . No t o n ly do In digen o us cultures have in telligen ce, believe me the DNA facto r has in telligen ce to o . An d p lan ts act in the p lan t’s o wn best in terest. They do n ’t act in an o ther sp ecies’ best in terest. So p lan ts aro un d the wo rld, gen erally sp eakin g, will p ro duce chemicals in their bo dies that are in ten ded to keep them fro m bein g eaten . Even the do mesticated p lan ts did that. So n o t o n ly did we n o t get the best p lan ts, we go t the p lan ts that we co uld get, but by do mesticatin g them we were do mesticatin g p lan ts that so metimes had defen sive mechan isms in them that made them n o t the p erfect fo o d fo r human s. In fact, this is the sp ecific p ro blem with the do mesticatio n o f p lan ts: Do mestic p lan ts are n o t the p erfect fo o d fo r human s. The p erfect fo o d fo r human s is made up o f the p lan ts that human s evo lved fro m. The o n es that human s wen t o ut an d gathered, usually the fruits an d n uts an d whatever it was that they fo un d, these were the survival p lan ts. So when we thin k o f agriculture, we might start thin kin g abo ut survival p lan ts. On e o f the legacies that we get fro m do mesticated p lan ts is the fact that there is so me p o rtio n o f o ur so ciety, so me n umber o f us in almo st every in stan ce who are un able to eat whatever the do mestic p lan t is. There are so me o f us who can ’t eat wheat. So me o f us can ’t eat barley. Whatever it is, so me o f us can ’t eat it. Then there’s the o ther p ro blem that q uite o ften we lo o k at: The reality that almo st all o f the do mesticated grain s are p o iso n un til they’re co o ked. They have to be co o ked befo re yo u can eat them o n so me level. Fro m the begin n in g we had these p ro blems with agriculture. Yet in sp ite o f callin g them p ro blems, ever sin ce we radiated o ut fro m wherever it was that we started o ut fro m, we’ve had to adap t to n ew en viro n men ts. The adap tatio n to n ew en viro n men ts has always mean t that human s had to fin d n ew p lan ts to have a n ew relatio n ship s with. Fo r the mo st p art, human s fo un d p lan ts that already grew in the wild, in n ature. So , fo r mo st o f the existen ce o f o ur sp ecies, o ur an cesto rs have been eatin g the p lan ts that n ature p ro vided fo r them an d sup p lemen tin g their diet with so me thin gs that they grew. In so me cases human s relied o n do mesticated an imals an d in so me cases they were basically hun tin g so me p art o f their diet. Fo r the mo st p art, ho wever, with the excep tio n o f the high arctic, meat p layed a fairly min imal ro le in the ultimate survival o f the human sp ecies. Our sp ecies survived because we in habited n ew en viro n men ts an d when we did, we learn ed abo ut the edible p lan ts that lived in tho se en viro n men ts. We learn ed ho w to live with tho se p lan ts an d, in fact, tho se p lan ts made it p o ssible fo r o ur sp ecies to survive in almo st every en viro n men t that is p resen tly in habited acro ss the p lan et. Our cumulative kn o wledge o f p lan ts made this a reality. It was o ur cumulative kn o wledge an d shared, p assed- do wn kn o wledge that made lo n g-term survival p o ssible. It’s what I like to call o ur co llective human heritage, which is the kn o wledge o f o ur relatio n ship to p lan ts. So me o f that relatio n ship had to do with what we did. We call it do mesticated. I do n ’t like that wo rd because it do esn ’t so un d recip ro cal en o ugh to me. The healthy relatio n ship between a human so ciety an d a p lan t has to be recip ro cal. The p lan t has to ben efit fro m it an d the human has to ben efit fro m it. Alas, I’m n o t clear whether so me o f these p lan ts have been co lo n ized by human s, o r whether the human s have been co lo n ized by the p lan ts! The clearest o n e o f all o f these is co rn . Co rn , it turn s o ut, is really q uite a mystical p lan t. In so me p laces, in so me cultures, it assumes the stature o f go ddess, but it is o n e o f tho se p lan ts that can ’t survive in the wild. It has to have human s. It has a recip ro cal relatio n ship with human s but that recip ro cal relatio n ship can be abused. We can lo o k at the mo dern co n ditio n o f co rn p lan ts. Co rn is so p o werful in o ur culture that if we were to take all o f the co rn in the who le o f the Un ited States an d p ut it in to o n e co rn field, that sin gle co rn field wo uld be the size o f New Yo rk State. It wo uld be un believably large, five hun dred miles acro ss an d fo ur hun dred miles the o ther way acro ss. Fro m that co rn field, which we have scattered acro ss the co n tin en t, will co me all o f the mo dern maladies. All o f the thin gs that human s have do n e to a p lan t have been do n e to co rn —all o f the p o iso n s, all the bio lo gical mo dificatio n s, all the hybridizatio n , all o f that. What is resultin g fro m this abuse is visible in o ther p arts o f the co un try. If we lo o k in to the Gulf o f Mexico , where mo st o f the watershed go es fo r mo st o f the co rn fields in the co un try, co min g o ut o f the Mississip p i River in to the Gulf o f Mexico is a p lume o f dead water. That dead water co mes fro m all o f the chemicals that are p ut in to gro win g co rn . Yes, we’re raisin g co rn , but if yo u really thin k abo ut it, it’s n o t a recip ro cal p ro cess. On the o n e side the co rn ben efits but o n the o ther side the sp ecies o f human s fo r gen eratio n s to co me will n o t ben efit because what’s hap p en in g is that we’re eatin g up the bio lo gical savin gs ban k o f the p lan et, p lan tin g a p lan t fo r the wro n g p urp o se. The co rn do esn ’t actually p ro duce fo o d. The co rn p ro duces mo n ey. We have tran sfo rmed o ur basic relatio n ship fro m o n e sp ecies o f co rn to a co rp o rate sp ecies. When I was first in graduate scho o l I had the very go o d timin g to arrive o n the scen e at abo ut the same mo men t that so me Ho p i Elders were go in g acro ss the co un try meetin g with o ther In digen o us Peo p les, traditio n al so cieties, an d talkin g abo ut their p ro p hecy. I was very fascin ated by that fo r a reaso n . When I was gro win g up as a Sen eca—an d I grew up in the traditio n al Sen eca co mmun ity—I was always struck by so methin g abo ut the Sen eca an d the Iro q uo is: they’re what yo u might thin k o f as p ractical. Yo u talk to them abo ut so methin g an d if they can ’t actually see it, an d p ut their fin ger o n it, an d to uch it, if yo u ask them to have faith in it an d believe in it, they wo n ’t. The o ld o n es didn ’t. They had this idea that if it’s n o t p ractical an d we can ’t actually exp erien ce it, see it, un derstan d it, then they kin d o f p ut it in to an o ther catego ry. In an y case, the Ho p i came—an d listen in g to the Ho p i we disco vered that co n trary to so me ways o f thin kin g, the Ho p i were also very p ractical. Just recen tly, so me p eo p le have redisco vered the Native American o rigin s o f p ragmatism. The bo o k that talks abo ut this is called Native American Pragmatism. Native Amer ican p r agmatis m is a way o f thin kin g abo ut the wo rld that deman ds that the thin ker lo o k at the o utco mes. When yo u thin k abo ut the great q uo tes fro m Native American p eo p le yo u get q uo tes like, “Let us lo o k fo rward to what we do to day an d ho w it ben efits the co min g gen eratio n s, seven gen eratio n s in the future.” “Let’s p ut o ur min ds to gether to see what kin d o f life we’ll give to o ur children ,” etc. This is the co n cep t o f o utco me. An d it’s differen t than Kissin gerian realism in that it req uires that all elemen ts o f an o utco me be desirable. Fo r in stan ce, keep in g a p residen t like Nixo n in p o wer might n o t have been desirable to man y o f us, so it’s n o t Machiavellian ist, it has a kin d o f req uiremen t that yo u lo o k far in to the future an d ask, “What are go in g to be the results o f what it is that yo u are do in g to day?” That way o f thin kin g used to asto n ish the British who came to meetin g after meetin g with the Iro q uo is an d were p o un ded with o rato ry. The Iro q uo is kep t askin g the British to thin k, yo u kn o w, thin k, what is this go in g to do in the future? The British. Thin k? The future? So I came alo n g abo ut the right time because I was do in g a lo t o f p ublic sp eakin g then , travelin g aro un d the co un try, an d again an d again I’d en d up at a p lace where the o ther sp eaker in the p ro gram was n o n e o ther than Tho mas Ban yacya. ( The late Tho mas Ban yacya, as discussed earlier in this bo o k, was a Ho p i tribal Elder active in p ro mo tin g the In digen o us wo rldview to o utside agen cies.) I was also meetin g with Tho mas Ban yacya when the Ho p i came in to Iro q uo is co un try. I was at tho se meetin gs an d I had a p retty go o d idea what his message was. There were a co up le o f times we wen t so mewhere to give a talk, an d Tho mas wo uld co me o ver to me an d he’d say, “I’m go in g to have to tell this sto ry, but I n eed so meo n e to ho ld up the o ther en d.” He had a thin g o n fabric, a fabric dep ictio n o f the p icto grap h that he wan ted to talk abo ut to illustrate his sto ry, so he’d co me o ver an d say, “Will yo u ho ld the o ther en d o f this?” I have to say, he was o ver seven ty years o ld an d he co uld ho ld that fabric fo r a lo n g time an d talk fo r q uite a while. He to ld a sto ry an d the Ho p i Elders who came with him to ld a sto ry. I’ve seen this sto ry rehashed an d rehashed sin ce then , but they leave o ut a co up le thin gs. In Tho mas’s versio n o f the sto ry, he said that, in the p ast, there were p revio us wo rlds, an d he says that we emerged fro m o n e o f tho se wo rlds in to this o n e, the fo urth wo rld. But in the p ast wo rlds human bein gs misbehaved in such a way that they o ffen ded the sp irits o f n ature, an d the sp irits o f n ature retaliated by causin g disasters. He said the o ffen sive thin gs that the human s did are the same thin gs that mo dern American so ciety is do in g, an d we n eed to go to the Un ited Natio n s an d exp lain to all o f the wo rld that what they’re do in g is the wro n g thin g, that so ciety is lettin g greed an d an imo sity an d un clear thin kin g take o ver. In so do in g they’re destro yin g the earth, an d what’s go in g to hap p en is that the earth is go in g to strike back. At o n e p o in t, the Ho p i Elders came to On an daga co un try an d asked the Six Natio n s o f the Iro q uo is Co n federacy to help them o n a missio n . The Six Natio n s had a treaty with the Ho p i, still co mmemo rated by a small feather in the o ld lo n g ho use o ver there o n the ceilin g. The treaty was a co mmitmen t by the Iro q uo is, to the Ho p i, which said, “Okay, we’ll do o ur best to help yo u fulfill yo ur missio n .” The missio n o f the Ho p i was that they had to go to a ho use o f mica o n the edge o f the waters in the East, an d they had to tell the wo rld—warn the wo rld—that what the wo rld was do in g was go in g to lead to disaster. No w, I was always kin d o f p uzzled abo ut this in a little way because my q uestio n , even to them then , was, o kay, then what? We go there. We tell them this. They’re n o t go in g to listen . What’s the p o in t? They said, “Well, we were to ld that’s what we were sup p o sed to do . We go tell them.” Then they said so methin g else I tho ught was kin d o f in terestin g: “The eviden ce, the p ro o f that what we’re sayin g is true, they have that already. It’s in their libraries, it’s in their scien ce—they already kn o w that this is true, they just haven ’t abso rbed it yet so o ur jo b is to go there an d tell them that this is the case. This is what’s go in g to hap p en .” The relatio n ship between the Ho p i an d Iro q uo is go es back at least to the 1 9 4 0 s. As the sto ry go es, so me o f their bo ys wo rked fo r the carn ivals an d so did so me o f o ur Iro q uo is bo ys an d they met that way, go in g p lace to p lace settin g up carn ivals. The wo rd go t back to the Ho p i that there were In dian s in the East. ( The Ho p i had been to ld that all the In dian s in the East had been killed an d there weren ’t an y In dian s left there.) So the Ho p i slo wly started this trek, in itially to the Alleghen y reservatio n in 1 9 4 8 an d then in 1 9 7 0 a big delegatio n came to up state New Yo rk. They sto p p ed at Alleghen y again o n the way. I was there fo r that an d then we wen t to On o n daga. All o f this, what was go in g o n with the In dian s, un fo lded well o ut o f sight o f the main stream American p ublic. So the co n versatio n was hap p en in g an d I wen t aro un d with Tho mas. I tho ught, “Hmm, there’s a lo t to this, but what is their p rimary, fun damen tal message really?” Because there was a p iece o f it that I co uldn ’t q uite un derstan d. In the en d, Tho mas did get to address the Un ited Natio n s. I wasn ’t there fo r that but o thers were. The day he addressed the Un ited Natio n s was the day that the wo rst sto rm in New Yo rk City’s histo ry to o k p lace. As Tho mas was in the Un ited Natio n s buildin g tellin g p eo p le that the wo rld was go in g to exp erien ce a ho rrible backlash by n ature, o utside in the street the water was three feet deep : it was fro m the rain sto rm that was blo win g in o ff the Atlan tic. The who le p lace was shut do wn . All the delegates fro m the UN wen t run n in g ho me an d they’ve n ever in vited an y In dian s back to tell their sto ry sin ce. It turn s o ut, tho ugh, that the Ho p i p ro p hecy is n o t the o n ly In dian p ro p hecy that talked abo ut these thin gs. There are o thers. The Iro q uo is have them, the Cree In dian s have them, differen t In dian s have them. So here’s what’s chan ged in thirty years abo ut thin kin g—in the last thirty years there’s been a to n o f revo lutio n in tho ught. It’s hap p en in g in a very, very small gro up o f p eo p le but it certain ly is very p o werful. Amo n g tho se thin gs that are hap p en in g is a lin guistic an thro p o lo gist n amed Ro bert Brin ghurst, who is also a p o et, tran slated o r retran slated a Haida myth. The bo o k that came o ut o f it is called Raven Steals the Light. To day, Raven Steals the Light is bein g to uted as a kin d o f wo rld literature. What it is abo ut is ho w human bein gs co me in to a relatio n ship with n ature that wo rks with p eo p le. It shares an un derstan din g that n ature can be hard o n p eo p le, an d they un derstan d ho w it wo rks a bit, an d they do n ’t see n ature as the en emy. The an cien t sto ries o f the In dian s, what so me call mytho lo gies, are a little bit like Greek mytho lo gies in that they’re really deep p sycho lo gical so rts o f co n versatio n s abo ut fears, abo ut dreams, an d abo ut ho w p eo p le relate to go ds that are n o t p redictable an d are at so me times even avaricio us. Basically yo u co uld summarize to so me degree what the Greeks thin k by their mytho lo gies. A lo t o f the sto ries are sayin g, “Well, shit hap p en s,” an d so metimes it’s just really bad shit. But the Greeks an thro p o mo rp hized their go ds. The Greek go ds so un d an d lo o k like human s. So metimes they co me to earth an d have sex with human s an d they do all so rts o f thin gs. They have n ames like human s, whereas in the Native American sto ries, q uite o ften the sp irits that are creatin g the earth so metimes are n o t human . An d they’re n o t really even an imals either; raven really isn ’t a raven , yo u un derstan d, but he acts fun n y if yo u read the sto ries. Here’s an in terestin g thin g abo ut p re-Christian Native American tho ught —it did n o t req uire yo u to have faith. In fact, it disco uraged it. Yo u do n ’t n eed to be a believer but yo u can be an ap p reciato r. Yo u can ap p reciate the gifts o f n ature, but it do esn ’t ask yo u to believe in an ythin g, but yo u have to be there fo r it. I thin k that when all tho se p eo p le arrived in all tho se eco systems we talk abo ut n o w, when they came to a sp ecific p lace, their p ro blem was: Ho w do I adap t to this p lace? What is this p lace? They came to deserts, to p lain s, an d they lo o ked at this p lace where maybe n o thin g was; it may have been a very barren p lace. So me o f them wen t to p laces that were dark half the year. So me o f them wen t to p laces that were water, co vered with sn o w an d ice. Others wen t to p laces that were so den se with fo liage they co uldn ’t see five feet ahead o f them. In these p laces, they had to co me up with a culture that n o t o n ly en abled them to survive in the p lace, they had to co me up with a culture that made them thr ive in it. They had to co me up with a culture that made them it. They blen ded in to that culture. They became p art o f that culture. That is the marvelo us cap acity o f o ur sp ecies to survive. Our adap tatio n isn ’t built o n o ur ability to build a n ew machin e. It’s n o t built o n o ur ability to alter a p lan t. It’s built o n o ur ability to live where p eo p le have n o t lived befo re, un der co n ditio n s they have n o t lived un der befo re. Lo o k at where they live. They live o n deserts o n which there’s p ractically n o thin g. They live in islan ds that so metimes o ffer very little in the way o f susten an ce. They live where n ature p ut them an d they adap t to that p lace. To tho se who thin k that the co n cep t o f glo bal warmin g is a n ew co n cep t let me turn yo u to the Ho p i. Listen to the Ho p i’s sto ry o f the fo ur wo rlds an d thin k abo ut climate chan ge. The Ho p i co me o ut o f a cultured co mp lex an d if yo u go do wn there to day—it’s a n ice drive do wn there, take a run do wn there an d have a lo o k. Start with the co mp lexes in n o rthern New Mexico an d in Co lo rado , an d then go to see all the so -called ruin s. Do n ’t sto p when yo u get to the Mexican bo rder. Keep go in g. The In dian s o f the Americas built civilizatio n after civilizatio n . They built irrigatio n co mp lexes. They p ut to gether mo re fo o d sp ecies, mo re cultivars, than all the rest o f the wo rld p ut to gether. In so do in g, fo r cen turies an d cen turies they fo ught again st climate chan ge in p lace after p lace an d in culture after culture. Do zen s o f them left behin d a reco rd o f that. So me o f them left behin d so me o f the mo st so p histicated altern atives in their q uest to successfully live in a n ew p lace. It is hard fo r us to imagin e the acco mp lishmen ts o f a classic Maya who was livin g o n a shelf o f ro ck, an d had n o water un der that, an d to lo o k at everythin g he did. Then time after time an d p lace after p lace they lo st the battle. They lo st the war o ver climate chan ge. When o ur turn co mes, when the climate chan ge co mes back, when the day after to mo rro w turn s in to the day after the day after to mo rro w, here’s my q uestio n —where’s o ur relatio n ship to tho se p lan ts? What are tho se p lan ts? Where are tho se p lan ts? Wher e is everythin g that we learn ed in the o n e in terglacial p erio d where thin gs go t warm an d we go t a chan ce to fix thin gs up all o ver the wo rld? All o f the survival techn iq ues we learn ed, abo ut o ur relatio n s to cultivars an d everythin g, at this ho ur stan ds in p eril. An d o ur relatio n ship to wild p lan ts stan ds in p eril. The big human relatio n ship to o ur cultural heritage is o n the verge o f extin ctio n an d we n eed to chan ge that. There are still en o ugh p lan ts left, but we do n ’t have en o ugh human s exp lo rin g en o ugh relatio n ship s with en o ugh p lan ts to en sure that when climate chan ge hap p en s—n o t if it hap p en s—but when it hap p en s, that we’ll have so me p lan t fo o ds to go o n with, fro m there. Human s will survive the n ext climate chan ge. Trust me. Human s will survive an ythin g. Co rp o ratio n s wo n ’t n ecessarily survive it tho ugh; Mo n san to wo n ’t survive it. But right n o w Mo n san to p ro duces almo st all o f o ur fo o d seed p ro ducts an d that’s the p ro blem. We n eed to mo ve away fro m that.

I ho p e yo u’ve seen p ho to s an d films o f the Man delbro t set an d the Julius set because to see that, yo u see her. There she is. If yo u lo o k at the Man delbro t set an d yo u turn it right side up , it’s the Great Mo ther. There she is. So what do we do when we resto re the p lan et? This is urgen tly imp o rtan t. We are n o t resto rin g the p lan et; she is resto rin g us. We’ve go t to get o ver this sen se o f p o wer, ego , an d hierarchy so p revalen t in this culture. The thin g abo ut hierarchies an d hero es is that we accep t it as THE main n arrative to live by. But the truth is, there aren ’t an y main n arratives. We do n ’t n eed to in ven t the sto ry. Fo r o n e thin g, there’s already a p erfectly go o d sto ry an d it’s very o ld. But I wan t to go beyo n d that an d say there isn ’t a sto ry. There are j i l l i ons o f sto ries. There are as man y sto ries as there are blades o f grass in the lawn s o f the Marin Civic Cen ter. An d mo re. The p ro blem is, because o f p atriarchy, because o f mo n archy, an d because o f mo n o to n y, we keep thin kin g there’s o n ly sup p o sed to be o n e—the Great Mo ther. What do yo u mean , the Great Mo ther? Or Go d the Father? We’re to ld there’s o n ly o n e. No there’s n o t. There’s n o t o n ly o n e. Lo o k at the wo rld. Did yo u ever see o n e blade o f grass? Yo u thin k yo u did because yo u’ve been raised to thin k o f it that way. But yo u can ’t see o n e blade o f grass; it isn ’t a p o ssibility. Yo u can ’t see o n e rain dro p , o n e sn o wflake. Yo u thin k yo u can . But it’s a scam. Yo u’ve been drugged, hyp n o tized in to thin kin g there’s such a thin g as o n e. The thin g abo ut tribal systems, abo ut the o ld, o ld sto ries is that they reco gn ize multip licity at every sin gle level. It’s always in teractio n . There isn ’t an y o ther way to talk abo ut it. Which makes tryin g to talk abo ut o ur tribal systems—n o t o n ly in En glish, but in the Western p aradigms an d the co n texts, like essays, o r even p o ems—so difficult. Yo u always have to have a subject, yo u have to have a verb, an d yo u have to have an o bject. That’s the way the lan guage wo rks. An d yo u have to have a main theme. Yo u have to have a sin gle thread o f tho ught. The min ute I start do in g that with n ative systems I start tellin g it wro n g. Then I start creatin g misun derstan din g. When I was little my mo ther used to say that all life is a circle, an d everythin g has its p lace within it. She used to say that in En glish. It already so un ds weird. All life’s p lural, an d there are lo ts an d lo ts o f circles, they dither abo ut in circles, all these lives. Within all o f tho se circular, circular, circulars, everythin g has an in teractive cap acity with everythin g else. As the Lako ta medicin e man an d teacher said, “If it weren ’t fo r that beetle”—an d he p o in ted to a beetle o n the gro un d right at that mo men t—he said, “I wo uldn ’t exist.” What did he mean ? He mean t that we’re all here. That’s ho w it is. When She thin ks, then we be. But n o w I just made it so un d like cause an d effect, an d o f co urse if we didn ’t be, She wo uldn ’t be thin kin g. Yo u can ’t sep arate the subject fro m the o bject. It do esn ’t sep arate. Or as they to ld me in multip licatio n an d divisio n , it do esn ’t go . Yo u can ’t p ut three in to o n e. That’s the p ro blem with mo n archy. That’s the p ro blem with mo n o theism. That’s the p ro blem with hierarchy. Twen ty-n in e billio n in to o n e do esn ’t go . Of co urse, we n eed mo dels. We n eed femin in e mo dels. We n eed these systems that I call gyn o cratic. An d why do I call them that? Because they’re based o n the femin in e p rin cip le. Oo p s, I just said “The . . . femin in e . . . p rin cip le.” There’s o n ly o n e an d it’s the right o n e an d we do n ’t wan t an y o f the wro n g o n es. No lesbian s an d n o Co mmun ists in o ur wo men ’s gro up . Femin in e p rin cip les mean o rgan izin g o urselves aro un d the idea o f in teractive co mmun ities. No w, tho se co mmun ities are p lan t co mmun ities an d critter co mmun ities an d sp irit co mmun ities an d sup ern atural co mmun ities an d human co mmun ities. We have to take all o f them in to acco un t. On e o f the p ro blems with the Western wo rld, in all o f its asp ects to day, right n o w in white fo lk’s time, is that we do n ’t un derstan d the sp irits. We do n ’t un derstan d the sup ern aturals. We do n ’t un derstan d that right here stan din g with us are multip le wo rlds co existin g, co habitin g, an d o ccup yin g the same sp ace with us. What the tribal p eo p le all reco gn ize is that tho se co mmun ities are abso lutely real an d have everythin g to do with us. What we’ve do n e in the West is walk away fro m them an d say, “Oh, sup erstitio n . Oh, devil. Oh, evil. We’ve do n e mo re in terestin g thin gs.” We’ve p ut military bases o n sacred sp o ts, as a frien d o f min e was p o in tin g o ut yesterday. An o ther in terestin g thin g we’ve do n e is we’ve fo un d the sacred p laces an d we’ve bo mbed them. No t in war, we call it target p ractice. I’m n o t en tirely sure what we’re tryin g to bo mb because yo u can ’t bo mb the sp irit. There’s just n o way yo u can do that. There’s a great, great fear o f that Other. Wo men , o f co urse, have been iden tified fo r five hun dred o r five tho usan d years, dep en din g o n where yo u’re co un tin g fro m, with that Other. With that evil. With that which is sup ern atural. With the vo id. With what yo u can ’t co n tro l. With irratio n ality an d hysteria, the en ergy o f the wo mb. With deco n structin g everythin g an d then reco n structin g it in n ew fo rms o ver an d o ver again . Wo men have been asso ciated with that an d then we’ve been demo n ized. Wo men were demo n ized then Native Peo p les were, all o ver the wo rld. Then an ybo dy else that co mes alo n g that yo u might p o ssibly be able to add to that p ile o f that which reco gn izes the immin en t real existen ce o f what so me systems have referred to in En glish as “the Great Mystery.” Yo u can ’t really walk o ut that do o r, because it isn ’t there. Yo u can ’t really sit in this ro o m because it isn ’t here. As Leslie Silko p uts it in her n o vel Ceremony, she has Ohko shta, the Lagun a medicin e man sayin g, “But gran dso n , yo u kn o w, this earth is fragile.” He do esn ’t mean we better take care o f it because, yo u kn o w, we’re go in g to run o ut o f reso urces an d then what will we eat. Shame o n us fo r thin kin g that way. Excuse me, but here we go again . I’ve go t to get n ew thin gs that are sustain able because o therwise I’m go in g to die. Well, yo u’re go in g to die. As far as I kn o w, there’s n o way o ut. I’ve go t to make sustain able systems because I wo rship Her. No w that’s an o ther thin g. That’s so methin g else. Because I ho n o r an d resp ect Her. That’s so methin g else en tirely an d that’s a go o d step ; a step to go . I give back mo re than I take, because it’s my n ature to tran sfo rm en ergy thro ugh this co n glo merate o f critters that I like to call my bo dy. En ergy co mes thro ugh me so I can en ergize an y p lace I am. That’s my magic. The reaso n She gives rise to this fo rmulatio n is because she’s reen ergizin g herself. She’s so go o d at it. She kn o ws. She’s so o ld. Fragile. She is in that. She’s co n tin ually tran sfo rmin g. Because She’s an o ld medicin e wo man . Because She’s an o ld so rceress. An d fro m time to time She thin ks up thin gs. She thin ks up din o saurs an d She thin ks up human bein gs an d She thin ks up co ckro aches. Actually, I’m n o t sure that She isn ’t a co ckro ach. They seem to be q uite in telligen t. They dreamed up all these cities because they thrive in them. They lo ve them. Electric light is great fun fo r them because they can p lay mo re games because they n ever q uite kn o w when o n e’s go in g to go o n an d they’re go in g to have to go run away! They have a go o d time. I’m n o t sure that the co ckro aches are n o t the smartest bein gs o n the p lan et. I do kn o w that we take to o much p o wer. We in the West believe that we can do an ythin g. We actually thin k that we can destro y the p lan et. Try it. We actually believe that we can create a p lan et. Try it. We can ’t do an y o f tho se thin gs. We aren ’t that big. We’re n o t that imp o rtan t. We just are here because we’re here. An d when my mo ther said all life is a circle an d everythin g has its p lace within it, she mean t man y, man y thin gs. I was bo rn in 1 9 3 9 an d they n uked New Mexico in 1 9 4 5 an d so by the time she’s tellin g me these thin gs it’s 1 9 4 7 . So she’s sayin g, n uclear weap o n s are p art o f the ho o p . Dro ughts, great, great dro ughts that devastated my co un try in New Mexico are p art o f the ho o p . Greedy, fearful, frighten ed megalo man iacs are p art o f the ho o p . Ho w do I kn o w that? Because we’re all here, aren ’t we? Here we are. What we’ve learn ed to do sin ce the burn in g times, as Western ers, is cho o se sides an d then go to war. Here we are, we’re all the co o l p eo p le an d there they are o ut there eatin g at Den n y’s an d they’re the n o t-co o l p eo p le. I do n ’t kn o w that I’m so co o l. I do kn o w that I’m here an d I’m gettin g o ld an d that’s ho w it go es, that’s the n atural tran sfo rmatio n . An d it’s a go o d trip q uite a bit o f the time. The Great Mo ther is beautiful, n o matter what. An d she’s p erfectly willin g to fall o n my head. She’s p erfectly willin g to erup t right n o w in to a vo lcan o like the mo vies they make in L.A. She do esn ’t care. She do es what she do es. She’s n o t n ice. She’s n o t p retty; she’s beautiful. An d I’m tellin g yo u so methin g abo ut the femin in e, what the femin in e mean s. She is o n e scary bitch. She gives real mean in g to the wo rd. We run aro un d as human s because we’re weak, an d that’s o kay. We’re human . That’s all right. That’s ho w we are. We try to co n tro l her. Yo u can ’t co n tro l a madwo man who ’s a so rceress. I can see why we try. Lo rd kn o ws I try all the time. But I try to keep it in p ersp ective. I’m tryin g because I feel vuln erable, n o t because I’m go in g to save the wo rld. The wo rld can save itself q uite well. It’s do in g it. There are so man y go o d p eo p le who are in vo lved in a n ew fo rm o f savin g the wo rld. It’s a wo n derful thin g. Yo u’re do in g it because She to ld yo u to . She co mes thro ugh yo ur bo dies an d han ds an d min ds an d mo uths. Gyn o cracy is mo re abo ut gran dmo thers’ femin in ity than abo ut mo thers’ femin in ity. Because where I co me fro m, all o ver n ative co un try, there isn ’t the go ddess, we talk abo ut gran dmo ther. There’s n o t the gran dmo ther, there’s gran dmo ther tree, an d gran dmo ther this an d gran dmo ther that. There are lo ts o f gran dmas. The thin g abo ut gran dmo thers is that they’ve sto p p ed men struatin g. An d what’s hap p en ed is that the fire is in side n o w. But it do esn ’t stay in side, o f co urse. What it do es is radiate o ut an d emp o wer the co mmun ity. All o f the co mmun ities—the co ckro aches, the beetles, the human s, the trees, the ho rses—everybo dy gets emp o wered by that. Gran dmo thers are fun n y because they thin k in very co n n ected ways. If yo u’ve reached gran dmo therly age yo u have disco vered yo u can ’t fin d a cen tral tho ught n o matter ho w hard yo u try. An d yo u say, o h my Go d, I’m lo sin g my min d. An d yo u are, an d isn ’t that wo n derful because yo u’re p luggin g in to min dfuln ess, the great big o n es, the huge systems that are always in teractin g an d in terco n n ectin g. So the gran dmo ther system is the o n e that says o kay, yo u’ve go t to feed the kids, all the kids—the co ckro ach kids an d the beetle kids an d the fo rest kids an d the Echin acea kids, an d all the kids. Yo u’ve go t to keep everythin g in balan ce because that’s yo ur jo b because yo u’re a gran dma an d that’s what yo u do . I ho p e it makes yo u a wo n derful life, because yo u’re sup p o sed to be here to have a go o d time. Yo u’re sup p o sed to be here to ho n o r the earth, to ho n o r the femin in e, to ho n o r chao s, to ho n o r terro r, to ho n o r fear, to ho n o r the sup ern atural, which is what yo u are. Which is what we all are. We go o ff in search o f the miraculo us an d yet we are it. The very fact that this amazin g co n glo merate o f critters is o ur bo dy is a miracle. There’s this who le wo rld that lives in yo ur eyelashes an d when yo u wash yo ur face yo u kill everybo dy. Did yo u kn o w that? Thin k abo ut it n ext time yo u wash yo ur face. All o f us are this walkin g p lan etary eco system. An d so meho w yo u say, I’m go in g to go have lun ch an d they all co me alo n g. That’s so rcery at its fin est. We wo rk to resto re the p lan et, an d the reaso n we’re do in g that is because the gran dmo thers are co min g back an d they’re n o t p issed. They’re tacky o ld ladies an d a bawdy sto ry, let’s face it. As they co me back, as we co me back, keep in min d that the earth herself is blo o min g again . The earth herself has go n e in to her p o stmen o p ausal self an d I kn o w this is true. She’s sayin g, here I am. Or as my gran dma used to say, “Here’s me.” So what we n eed to do is exactly what we’re all do in g witho ut the judgmen t p art, witho ut the critical p art. Witho ut the “Oh, I’ve go t to be go o d.” Yo u do n ’t have to be go o d. Yo u just have to be. Because there’s n o way to sto p bein g. Yo u can dro p dead, but it do esn ’t matter, yo u’re still go in g to be. Yo u can ’t chan ge, fix, o r so lve an ythin g. But yo u can live an d learn an d have gratitude an d lo ve. Then yo u’re here because yo u’re here because yo u’re Her, because we’re us. No w let’s get o n with bein g an d with n urturin g each o ther an d all the children an d everythin g aro un d us. This p resen tatio n to o k p lace at the Bio n eers Co n feren ce in 1 9 9 7 . 1 6 Ethio p ian Wo men : Fro m Passive Reso urces to Active Citizen s B og a le tc h Ge b re Altho ugh literacy allo wed me to escap e man y o f the harsher realities o f my childho o d an d tho se o f my sisters an d my mo ther, o n e thin g I did n o t escap e is female gen ital excisio n ( FGE) . My p aren ts weren ’t educated but they were wise an d in telligen t. They wo uld n ever in ten tio n ally hurt their daughters. Fo r yo u to un derstan d what I’m tryin g to say, I wo uld like to take yo u back to my ho me in rural Ethio p ia. I n eed to tran sp o rt yo u back there so yo u can imagin e what it was like to be a twelve-yearo ld girl bein g taken o ut o f yo ur ho me like a sheep to a slaughter by yo ur o wn aun ts an d co usin s. This was sup p o sed to be a mo men to us, p ro ud o ccasio n in my life, but I kep t cryin g. My mo m was also cryin g. I heard her rep eatin g o ver an d o ver, “I wish they wo uld do away with this. I wish they wo uld do away with this.” But we bo th accep ted the p ractice because that’s what we tho ught we sho uld un dergo to make us “who le wo men ”—takin g away the very thin g that makes us feel like a wo man . Girls are o ften fo rced in to marriage at an early age, so metimes by abductio n . Man y wo men , in cludin g two o f my sisters, died in childbirth. Other wo men are destin ed to live in backbreakin g, tedio us, abusive circumstan ces like my mo ther did. I do n o t usually like to sp eak abo ut myself, but I decided to do so to day. I have n ever sp o ken fran kly abo ut my o wn life in p ublic befo re. I was n ever mean t to be here, n ever to be educated o r to thin k fo r myself. No t because I’m un iq ue, but because I am a wo man : a wo man fro m the village o f Zato in remo te Ethio p ia. On e day when I was in graduate scho o l here in the Un ited States, I met a wo n derful p erso n who became my best frien d. We started talkin g abo ut female gen ital excisio n . She was ho rrified; I was o utraged. Ho w dare she q uestio n the mo st sacred, the mo st p recio us p art o f my life? The p art that made me a “who le wo man .” Even as I defen ded my culture I exp erien ced an in credible awaken in g, then a tidal wave o f an ger, as I began to co mp rehen d all that had been taken fro m me in ign o ran ce. I began to un derstan d that the real p urp o se o f female gen ital excisio n was to excise my min d; my ability to live my life with all my sen ses in tact. Tears o f un derstan din g flo o ded fro m me as I allo wed the scien tist in me to see, to examin e in a n ew light, all that I remembered: the in fectio n s, the deaths o f my sisters, the chro n ic p ain , an d the p hysical an d p sycho lo gical n umbin g left with the scars. Yo u can ’t imagin e ho w hard it is fo r me to sp eak abo ut this in p ublic an d share it with yo u. I cho o se to sp eak, to do so n o w, because in the p ast five years I have been askin g families an d co mmun ities to sp eak again st FGE. Just n o w, fo r the first time in o ur histo ry, yo un g girls, yo un g men , mo thers, even circumcisers—the very p eo p le who make a livin g o ut o f this p ractice—are sp eakin g o ut by the hun dreds, even tho usan ds. I must sp eak in fro n t o f yo u because to day when little girls co mp o se so n gs an d sin g again st female gen ital mutilatio n , when circumcisers stan d up an d strike a match an d burn a p lastic bag ( which demo n strates the scarrin g o f the female gen italia) , they are sayin g “See, this is what yo u ask us to do to yo ur children ,” then I, to o , must stan d up in fro n t o f yo u an d sp eak o ut so that yo u can un derstan d. All o f these p eo p le in my ho me regio n who are stan din g up again st FGE allo w me to dare to thin k that o ur strategies have the p o ten tial to sp read thro ugh my ho melan d an d beyo n d. After my awaken in g, I began to dream o f return in g to my birthp lace to start an NGO that wo uld help wo men address their co n cern s, in cludin g the traditio n al p ractices that n egatively imp act us. I dreamed o f develo p in g three co mp rehen sive in terco n n ected p ro grams: health, liveliho o d, an d en viro n men t p ro tectio n —like the three-legged sto o l I used to sit o n in the traditio n al, thatched-ro o f ro un dho use I grew up in . If o n e o f the legs breaks, yo u can n o t sit o n the sto o l; it can n o t sup p o rt yo u. Fo r o n ce I was determin ed that we wo uld treat wo men as if they are en titled to a who le life as who le human bein gs, with who le families, within co mmun ities cap able o f p ro ducin g values that n urture an d sup p o rt them. We wo uld n o t see wo men as o n ly basket weavers while men are train ed in n ew techn o lo gies. We wo uld n o t co me as o utsiders, like fo reign ers, an d imp o se p ro grams. We wo uld facilitate an d discuss thin gs with them, n o t dictate to them. With man y small co n tributio n s an d a majo r start-up fun d by o n e o f the fun ders o f Bio n eers an d a member o f o ur bo ard, I wen t ho me, fin ally, in Octo ber o f 1 9 9 7 to begin wo rkin g to ward o ur visio n fo r the future. We were able to establish o ur NGO o n seven p recio us acres gran ted to o ur Kembatta Wo men ’s Self-Help Cen ter ( KMG) by the mun icip ality o f Durame to wn ship . As the first wo man fro m my village to be educated abro ad, man y p eo p le exp ected me to establish clin ics, scho o ls, facto ries, but they did n o t exp ect me to do so in the n ame o f “Wo man .” No . It was min d-bo gglin g fo r wo men in my ho me regio n to see the cen ter n amed fo r them. Fo r the men , to o , it was hard to accep t. Fo r so me, it seemed like a waste o f time. But we co n tin ued. An d to day the cen ter is a p lace o f ho p e fo r everybo dy, n o t just fo r wo men . We built the first p ublic library in the who le regio n ( but it is still emp ty) . We built a Wo men ’s Dialo gue Ho use, which is the heart o f the Wo men ’s Cen ter. Traditio n ally, Elders ( always men ) wo uld co n ven e un der a large tree to dialo gue, to reso lve co n flict, to determin e ho w the village sho uld live. Their so n s were allo wed to sit with the Elders to learn their wisdo m. Wo men n ever sat with them un der that big tree. To day, we have a p lace fo r wo men to discuss issues that co n cern them, an d believe me, it’s n o t just chitchat. We started small, in just two districts so we co uld exp an d as we gain ed exp erien ce, an d learn fro m it an d fro m o ur mistakes. But as we lo o ked fo r sup p o rt, p o ten tial fun ders to ld us o ur visio n was to o big. I wan ted to sho ut: “But lo o k! Everythin g is co n n ected! Yo u can ’t address health witho ut p ro vidin g water; yo u can ’t address the n eed fo r water witho ut p ro tectin g the en viro n men t! Yo u can ’t address health witho ut thin kin g o f liveliho o d! Everythin g is co n n ected. What’s wro n g with that? I’m givin g it to yo u all in o n e p ackage! ” So we co n tin ued. We didn ’t desp air. An d this “p ackage” is begin n in g to wo rk. The p ackage lin kin g eco n o my, eco lo gy, an d so cial an d p o litical systems is p ro ducin g results. Just recen tly we sup p o rted the weddin g o f the first girl who p ublicly refused to be cut. A rebel. Her husban d hap p en ed to be a member o f o ur wo men ’s advo cacy an d sup p o rt gro up an d facilitates discussio n s in his co mmun ity. This co up le is wo n derful. They are the future. What I see in the p ictures o f their weddin g is men an d wo men makin g decisio n s to gether, as eq uals. Peo p le came to the celebratio n fro m all o ver; o ver twen ty tho usan d o f them. They o rgan ized theatrical p erfo rman ces an d gave sp eeches an d recited p o ems—all again st female gen ital excisio n . A televisio n crew fro m Addis Ababa traveled 3 7 8 kilo meters to video tap e this weddin g, which was bro adcast in fo ur lan guages, n atio n ally. Leaders who usually do n ’t sho w up ( p articularly fo r wo men ’s co n cern s) came to watch an d p articip ate. Men realized that day ho w p ro fo un dly they n eed a revo lutio n fro m the heart o f wo men an d the heart o f n ature. The go vern o r who atten ded the weddin g heard the wo rds o f a mo ther who refused to have her daughter circumcised. Alo n g with all o f us, he saw this same daughter beco me an advo cate fo r the Wo men ’s Cen ter an d p articip ate in the dramatic p erfo rman ce by yo un g studen ts again st FGE. As the men watched the p lay un fo ld, yo u co uld see they were bashful. We all wo n dered ho w they were go in g to be able to deal with this break fro m traditio n . The bride herself was wearin g a han d-lettered p lacard o n her chest that p ro claimed, “I am n o t circumcised. Learn fro m me.” An d this o ccurred in a regio n where a girl who is n o t married do es n o t p ro n o un ce the wo rd “circumcisio n .” The term fo r the p ractice is “remo vin g the dirt.” It to o k such co urage fo r a yo un g girl to make this p ublic statemen t an d fo r yo un g men to stan d up an d say, “We wan t to marry un cut girls.” What we fo un d o ver an d o ver again was that, in fact, these yo un g p eo p le are way ahead o f us. In o n e o f o ur semin ars at the cen ter, a yo un g man raised his han d an d to ld us, “Do n ’t wo rry, the days o f circumcisio n are o ver. It may be aro un d five o r seven years mo re, but that’s it. What yo u sho uld wo rry abo ut is ho w yo u’re go in g to co un sel tho se girls who have been circumcised because they will n o t fin d husban ds.” At KMG, o ur metho ds to achieve o ur en ds are n o t always co n ven tio n al but the mo st imp o rtan t thin g we can give is resp ect—resp ect an d dign ity to the p eo p le, to their culture, their wisdo m, an d their way o f life. Witho ut judgin g an yo n e we en gage in dialo gue an d co n verse with co mmun ities as eq uals, allo win g everyo n e to make his o r her o wn in fo rmed decisio n . Yo u sho uld see an o ther yo un g wo man . Her n ame is Abarash. She has been called o ur “Ro sa Parks,” like the wo man in the American So uth who sp arked the Civil Rights Mo vemen t. Abarash was abducted when she was sixteen years o ld, an eleven th grader in scho o l. We fo ught to brin g her back an d have the co mmun ity accep t her. Usually girls who are abducted an d rap ed are co n sidered to be “damaged go o ds” an d shun n ed by their families an d co mmun ities; these girls are fo rced to stay with their victimizers, their abducto rs. A year after her abductio n , Abarash sto o d up in fro n t o f a multitude o f p eo p le an d sp o ke p ublicly abo ut her o rdeal. This was a first. No girl had ever do n e that befo re. To day Abarash is a co llege studen t. She co n tin ues to sp eak o ut in scho o ls an d co mmun ities, an d because o f her co urage, we n o w have ten o ther yo un g girls who were abducted, but have return ed to their families an d are go in g to scho o l. I have to tell yo u this didn ’t co me easily. We must train the p o licemen , the judiciary, the co mmun ity at large in human rights, in gen der rights, in co n stitutio n al rights, yo u n ame it. Like I said, everythin g is a p ackage. Yo u can n o t erase female gen ital excisio n witho ut takin g the rest o f the so cial fabric in to co n sideratio n . I wo uld like to tell yo u abo ut o ur vo catio n al train in g, an d the busin ess we are creatin g fo r wo men so that they can be mo re than basket-makers; so they can also be decisio n -makers. We are creatin g a system to get p o table water clo se to their co mmun ities so their backs wo n ’t break as they walk fo r ho urs daily to distan t sp rin gs to brin g huge jugs o f water to their families. This will give them time to go to scho o l to learn n ew thin gs, an d to hear n ew ideas to create an d earn a livin g, so that their wo rk is given value, an d they are valued as human bein gs. Maybe yo u have read that Ethio p ia is o n e o f the fo ur co un tries in the wo rld that the Un ited Natio n s says is at risk o f an exp lo sive gro wth o f HIV/AIDS. In Ethio p ia, the ratio o f in fectio n is seven teen wo men to ten men . The fastest-gro win g demo grap hic is yo un g wo men . With girls between the ages o f fifteen an d twen ty-fo ur, the in fectio n rate is five to seven times higher than that o f the bo ys their age. Female excisio n is a silen t facilitato r o f AIDS because scars tear durin g in terco urse, in creasin g the exchan ge o f fluids. We are sen sitizin g co mmun ities abo ut HIV/AIDS—an amazin g p hen o men o n . We are wo rkin g with a Un ited Natio n s Pro gram ( UNDP) o n the p reven tio n an d co n tro l o f HIV/AIDS.

Mo st wo men in Kembatta see a do cto r o n ly o n their deathbed ( an d this is if they are lucky en o ugh to see o n e even then ) . On ly when thin gs go terribly wro n g—usually durin g labo r to give birth to a healthy baby un able to break thro ugh the scarrin g caused by excisio n —do they seek help . Then , in a p ro cessio n that breaks yo ur heart, yo u see a bleedin g wo man bein g carried o n a makeshift stretcher to a to wn in search o f help . Man y die alo n g the way. That’s why o ur KMG Mo ther-Child Health Clin ic is the mo st imp o rtan t, the mo st urgen t, o f all o ur p ro jects to date. It will p ro vide o bstetrics, matern ity, an d p ediatric services an d p reven tive health care that is n o t available an ywhere else.

We are just abo ut three hun dred tho usan d do llars away fro m o p en in g o ur do o rs. Attemp ts have been made to sto p the p ractice o f FGE by edict, by dictate, an d by p ersuasio n . Christian missio n aries to ld co mmun ities in Sudan an d Ken ya that if they didn ’t sto p the p ractice, their children wo uld n o t be allo wed to atten d scho o l. The co mmun ities then built their o wn scho o ls. Then the British co lo n ial rulers tried makin g FGE illegal. Peo p le started circumcisin g their daughters at n ight, in secret, an d mo re girls died, so the ban was revo ked. To day, we are fightin g n ew p hen o men o n kn o wn as the “medicalizatio n ” o f female gen ital excisio n . In p laces where traditio n al circumcisers, co n vin ced o f the dan ger, have sto p p ed the p ractice, a n ew p ractitio n er has arisen : the “p lastic bag do cto r,” as the lo cal p eo p le call them. As the traditio n al p ractitio n ers turn away fro m FGE an d jo in us as agen ts o f chan ge, medical assistan ts in a few medical clin ics are takin g advan tage o f the situatio n , makin g mo n ey o n girls’ lives. They charge five do llars p er girl. But this is so methin g we are fightin g. To day the girls who have been educated in KMG cen ters are vigilan t. They wo rk with the p o lice an d the judiciary, an d they brin g the p ractitio n ers to co urt. To day, ten o f them have been in carcerated. There are so man y amazin g sto ries I co uld tell yo u. On e o f them is abo ut o ur Hambericho Mo un tain , a belo ved lan dmark that has beco me a symbo l o f o ur en viro n men tal p ro tectio n p ro gram. Because o ur ratio o f lan d to p o p ulatio n is so small an d cro wded it is difficult to sp eak to co mmun ities abo ut the n eed to p ro tect the en viro n men t. But we have fo un d a way. We reached p eo p les’ hearts, the Elders’ hearts, by callin g o n traditio n s that might o therwise be lo st as we wo rk to elimin ate harmful p ractices like FGE. In o ur KMG Cen ter in Durame we built a traditio n al ro un dho use with a thatched ro o f. This is an o ther dyin g traditio n . Its design is an art in itself; its in tern al o rgan izatio n is very so p histicated. This dyin g symbo l has been rebo rn with the help o f o ur Elders. When we raised the cen tral p o st o f this ho use, there was a big celebratio n . On the day o f the p o st-raisin g ( called Utub o) , we in vited three hun dred Elders fro m aro un d the mo un tain to co me an d help us raise the Utubo , as the traditio n dictates. In fro n t o f the ro un dho use, with Hambericho Mo un tain o verlo o kin g the ceremo n y in the distan ce, we sp o ke to the Elders abo ut the imp o rtan ce o f the mo un tain to the co mmun ity’s life an d imagin atio n . We talked abo ut ho w the mo un tain is bein g defo rested, ho w the wildlife is dyin g o ut. The Elders were mo ved to tears. They un dersto o d immediately. So me said, “Yo u are brin gin g back to us what we have lo st. Hambericho used to be o ur sto mach, o ur backbo n e, a p lace where we used to wo rship . We used to p ro tect it by o n ly p ermittin g o n e time durin g the year to hun t. What will we have left if o ur Hambericho dies?” Sin ce then , Hambericho Mo un tain has beco me the symbo l o f o ur en viro n men tal mo vemen t, with the Elders sp earheadin g o ur effo rts to resto re it an d save it. As I have said befo re, un til we resto re the health o f o ur wo men , we’ll n ever resto re the health o f o ur co mmun ities.

Gro win g up in my co mmun ity, I’d swim in the grassy chan n els o f the sn ye ( chen ail) p o rtio n o f the great St. Lawren ce River o n o ur Mo hawk reservatio n . I remember that at the age o f five I witn essed this huge en viro n men tal chan ge bein g un dertaken there. The St. Lawren ce River is o ur sacred Kaniataraowaneneh, the p lace where man y waters co n verge. I wo uld see these big, huge ship s startin g to make their way do wn the big ship p in g chan n els. Even the massive dredgin g o f sedimen ts fro m the river bo tto m to acco mmo date the ever-in creasin g size an d n umber o f in tern atio n al ship s illustrates o n e en viro n men tal justice thread o f co n cern in a weave o f man y. Ro bert Mo ses’ en gin eers literally sco o p ed up to n s o f co n tamin ated material fro m the bo tto m o f the St. Lawren ce River an d dump ed it o n the sho res o f o ur reservatio n co mmun ity—called Akwesasne, the lan d where the p artridge drums—so that we had these huge hills o f un co vered, co n tamin ated sedimen ts alo n g the sho relin e in so me sectio n s. These areas were n ever p lan ted with grass o r trees—to bio accumulate the heavy metals co n tain ed in these sedimen ts—as they had been in the co mmun ities o f Ogden sburg an d Massen a an d o n do wn in to Oswego . In my visio n as a Mo hawk midwife, rep ro ductive justice an d en viro n men tal justice in tersect at the n exus o f wo man ’s blo o d an d vo ice; at the very cen trality o f wo man ’s ro le in the p ro cesses an d p attern s o f co n tin uo us creatio n . Of the sacred thin gs that there are to be said abo ut this, wo man is the first en viro n men t; she is an o rigin al in structio n . In p regn an cy, o ur bo dies sustain life.

In this way, we as wo men are the earth. Man y Mo hawk traditio n al cultural p ractices are p ro tective o f the health o f wo men , children , an d the co mmun ity. I can thin k o f n o mo re p o werful examp le o f this than breastfeedin g, the health ben efits o f which fo r the mo ther-in fan t p air are well do cumen ted elsewhere. It was in seekin g to p ro tect this valuable, sustain able cultural reso urce that I ap p ro ached the St. Regis Mo hawk Tribal Co un cil an d the Mo hawk Co un cil o f Akwesasn e to en gage with them the demo cratizin g co n structs o f p articip ato ry actio n research in co llabo ratio n with agen cies in side an d o utside o ur co mmun ity.

This req uires a willin gn ess to see thro ugh an o ther’s eyes to o verco me limited p ersp ectives o f what is p o ssible; to hear thro ugh an o ther’s ears to develo p jo in t strategies fo r actio n . In so me o f the eco lo gical an alysis co n ducted by my co mmun ity, o f everythin g fro m p lan ts in p eo p le’s garden s to farm an imals to wild an imals an d all the way up the fo o d chain to the n ursin g in fan t, we began to see ho w heavy metals in these p iles o f co n tamin ated sedimen ts mo ved thro ugh the fo o d chain in to , fo r examp le, co rn that was raised by a Mo hawk gran dfather an d fed to his gran dchildren .

These same co n gen ers o r co n tamin an ts were also fo un d in Mo hawk mo ther’s milk; I was o n e o f the actual study p articip an ts. Because o ur n ursin g in fan ts are at the to p o f the fo o d chain , they in herit a bo dy burden o f in dustrial co n tamin an ts fro m o ur blo o d by way o f o ur milk; thus are we p art o f the lan dfill, co lo n ized. This stark sacrilege came to my atten tio n when a mo ther in my care who lived n o t far fro m the Gen eral Mo to rs Co rp o ratio n lan dfill asked if it was safe to breastfeed. The to xic waste site situated o n the ban ks o f the St. Lawren ce River an d n amed o n the Natio n al Prio rities List*9 o f 1 9 8 3 featured two PCB-filled o p en lago o n s, which leaked in to o ur St. Lawren ce River—the lifeblo o d o f o ur co mmun ity—an d co n tamin ated the lo cal fo o d chain . Each gen eratio n o f o ur vuln erable yo un g in herited a bo dy burden o f lo cal in dustrial co n tamin an ts fro m their mo thers who co n sumed lo cally caught fish. So in all o f these in sidio us ways, we’re exp o sed to to xic co n tamin an ts in the en viro n men t as a result o f the in dustrializatio n o f o ur wo rld.

Alo n g tho se sho res we’ve develo p ed a lo t o f stren gth in resp o n din g to tho se kin ds o f crises, they are n o thin g n ew to us. Everythin g we do , everythin g that we are, co mes to us fro m o ur en viro n men t. Our who le Kahniakehaka, o ur Mo hawk way o f life, has everythin g to do with the celebratio n o f the cycles o f life, fro m the time in the sp rin g when the map le syrup run s. The map le is the leader o f the trees, the chief o f the Tree Peo p le. We give gratitude to the creatio n , to the map le fo r that gift, the sign that life will co n tin ue to the harvest, to the green co rn , to the harvest ceremo n ies, the than kin g o f the thun ders. All o f that we still co n tin ue to do , an d we see the en viro n men tal justice mo vemen t as so methin g that aro se o ut o f a wo rld that began to p ay atten tio n to the destructio n o f eco lo gical systems. Fro m this atten tio n to the details o f ho w systems are affected aro se the 1 9 9 1 First Natio n al Peo p le o f Co lo r En viro n men tal Leadership Summit Rep o rt to the Un ited States En viro n men tal Pro tectio n Agen cy an d the Office o f the Presiden t.

I also started hearin g abo ut the PCB-co n tamin atio n o f In uit mo thers’ milk in n o rthern Quebec. These In uit wo men were cho sen by scien tists at Laval Un iversity in Quebec City to be the co n tro l gro up fo r wo men in the so uth, in Mo n treal, who lived alo n g the St. Lawren ce River. Because they weren ’t exp o sed to St. Lawren ce River fish, the scien tists exp ected that these In uit wo men who live in p ristin e en viro n men ts—which are so remo te that they are o n ly accessible by bush p lan e—wo uld be the co n tro l fo r wo men in the in dustrialized so uth. But lo an d beho ld, because o f the dep o sitio n o f PCBs in to James Bay an d in to the waters where these wo men co n sume n in e meals o f fish an d sea mammals a mo n th, they have the highest do cumen ted levels o f PCBs o n the en tire p lan et in their breast milk. In fact, wherever yo u go o n this earth, yo u’re go in g to fin d to xic co n tamin an ts in mo thers’ milk. But it do esn ’t mean that it’s n o t safe to breast- feed. Our p o licy in o ur co mmun ity is that breastfeedin g is the safest ro ute in this en viro n men t. That alo n e was a p ro cess o f emp o wermen t fo r Mo hawk mo thers themselves in that they were co in vestigato rs with research scien tists who are very well-kn o wn in their fields. These scien tist are the o n es who read the p ap ers at the scien tific meetin gs acro ss the co un try an d in tern atio n ally.

It’s highly emo tio n al, highly dep ressin g wo rk an d we must struggle again st desp air. Fo r this reaso n , my wo rk as a life-giver is always the an tido te fo r me to main tain a sen se o f balan ce. In o ur creatio n sto ry, it was a p regn an t wo man who fell fro m a ho le in the Sky Wo rld, fro m an o ther reality where the sacred Tree o f Life was dyin g, to create the reality we’re livin g n o w. As she fell thro ugh the ho le in the Sky Wo rld created by the up ro o tin g o f the sacred Tree, she grasp ed at the edge o f the ho le. In so do in g, seeds an d bits o f the sacred became embedded un dern eath her fin gern ails, as she grasp ed at the ho le an d the ro o ts o f the Tree as she tried to keep fro m fallin g. Fallin g to the great o cean belo w, she lan ded o n the back o f a great sea turtle.

When we resp o n d to these issues it adds stren gth to the gen eratio n al imp ulse to regain who we are as Kahn iakehaka p eo p le, to regain that Kahniakehaka neha, the way o f the p eo p le o f the flin t, to keep that p recio us way o f thin kin g, o f bein g, o f do in g, o f seein g, alive—n o t o n ly in o ur o wn p erso n al realities, o ur co mmun ity realities, but in o ur children .

She said, “I’m a little girl un der wago n s an d there’s In dian s go in g ro un d an d ro un d sho o tin g arro ws at us.” This has been a recurrin g dream sin ce her childho o d. This illustrates ho w deep ly embedded the fear o f the Native, the In digen o us, what an thro p o lo gists call “the Other” is in the American p syche. So when I go aro un d in my wo rk, I have to remember the reality o f that histo ry an d ho w that imp acts whatever yo u’re wo rkin g o n in so cial justice mo vemen ts. We all n eed to seek healin g. There’s a lo t bein g written fo r tho se o f yo u who are win din g yo ur way thro ugh the academy abo ut the p lace o f scien ce, the p hilo so p hy o f scien ce, the limitatio n s o f scien ce, an d ho w scien ce itself, by virtue o f ho w it’s fun ded, ho w it’s sup p o rted, can n o t be o bjective. Already, dep en din g o n the so urce o f its fun din g, mo st scien ce o ccurs in this co un try to serve that ideo lo gy o f p ro gress, to serve the co n sumer men tality. The crisis that we see aro un d us, sp in n in g even n o w, begin n in g to further man ifest itself in glo bal warmin g issues is so methin g that’s go in g to wake all o f us up to n o t just en viro n men tal justice issues but co n cern s that belo n g to every co mmun ity an d every in dividual. QUESTION AND DISCUSSION Q uestion: My q uestio n to yo u co mes fro m hearin g Dr. San dra Stein greber, an d readin g her bo o k, Living Downstream: An Ecologist Looks at Cancer and the Environment. When she sp o ke in San ta Cruz, she was sayin g ho w it’s in to lerable to be regulatin g, mo n ito rin g, an d p ermittin g kn o wn an d susp ected carcin o gen s in to the en viro n men t, that it’s a fo rm o f ho micide an d that we n eed to do so methin g abo ut it because we kn o w a certain n umber o f vuln erable p eo p le will die. I’m p arap hrasin g her, o f co urse. She said we n eed a mo vemen t alo n g the lin es o f the civil rights, suffragettes, an d the abo litio n mo vemen ts. The abo litio n ists didn ’t say, just ban slavery o ver there in that little area. It has to go acro ss the bo ard; we see o ur struggles all o ver. I’m with Pesticide Watch, Farm Witho ut Harm, To xics Actio n Co alitio n in o ur area. Ho w can we fo rge a huge mo vemen t to sto p this? No t to study it an ymo re, n o t to be p ut thro ugh the mazes o f the EPA, which I call the En viro n men tal Po llutio n Agen cy by the way, o r the DPR, Dep artmen t o f Pesticide Rep resen tatio n . They’ve abdicated their resp o n sibility to p ro tect p ublic health. I’d like us to be wo rkin g o n a massive, sto p the to xin s, sto p the co rp o rate p o iso n in g o f the earth camp aign . I wo n dered if yo u had co mmen ts o n this? K atsi Cook: The q uestio n is, ho w do we chan ge the wo rld? So metimes it’s go o d to lo o k at ho w the wo rld go t to be where it is right n o w. Fo r the p art o f the wo rld where I co me fro m it began in Wo rld War II an d it began with the Christ-bearin g co lo n izer, which is the tran slatio n o f the n ame Christo p her Co lumbus. I’m n o t here to in sult o r hurt the feelin gs o f an y Christian s, but the reality is that when Christo p her Co lumbus came there were debates in Sp ain abo ut whether we were human bein gs because we didn ’t have so uls. The o n ly way to have a so ul was to be bap tized. As a reco vered Ro man Catho lic an d bo rn -again p agan I see the ro o ts o f the men tal issues, the tho ught p ro cess o f my o wn p eo p le co min g o ut o f o p p ressio n , based o n the cap acity to believe in who yo u are an d who yo u came o n to this earth to be. I can o n ly han dle tho se issues that yo u had asked abo ut in yo ur elo q uen t q uestio n o n a o n e-to o n e, in dividual, in terp erso n al basis with the mo thers an d families that I serve. Every time that I’m able to sup p o rt a Kahn iakehaka wo man in givin g birth, to co me to her o wn blo o d an d vo ice in the creatio n o f her reality, is the o n ly way that I can , in that macro level, so lve that p ro blem, because o f the feelin g we have as in dividuals that we can o n ly do so much. It’s abo ut tran sfo rmatio n an d resto ratio n . We wan t to kn o w in o ur co mmun ity ho w we get back to where we were, where we are, where we n eed to be. It’s n o t a matter o f ro man ticism o r livin g in the p ast. It’s a matter o f makin g an en viro n men t where we can reco ver fro m the histo ry that we’ve en dured an d n o w n eed to be able to thin k clearly abo ut ho w to so lve. Yo u have to en gage the same p ro cess in yo ur o wn lives, in yo ur o wn families, an d in yo ur o wn co mmun ities. Essen tially to me this is a culture based o n fear, an d un til yo u can co p e with gettin g p eo p le to a p lace where they can thin k clearly, n o thin g will chan ge. Everybo dy’s afraid. That’s what it’s abo ut. Q uestion: I just wan ted to briefly men tio n that I believe that the en viro n men tal an d eco lo gical crisis is, at its ro o ts, a crisis o f culture. An d by that, I’m talkin g abo ut the do min an t so ciety culture that go es back to Cristo bal Co lo n an d even much earlier than that, sp ecific to do cumen ts issued by the Vatican in the mid-fifteen th cen tury, which said to cap ture, van q uish, an d subdue all Saracen s, p agan s, an d o ther en emies o f Christ, to p ut them in to p erp etual slavery an d take away all their p o ssessio n s an d their p ro p erty. That was fo llo wed by an o ther do cumen t called the In ter Caetera Bull o f 1 4 9 3 , which called fo r the subjugatio n o f all barbaro us n atio n s to p ro p agate the Christian emp ire. An d so they’ve been brin gin g their emp ires acro ss the who le western hemisp here an d buildin g them thro ugho ut the wo rld. An d that wo rd “scien ce” ap p ears in the Pap al Bull o f 1 4 9 3 , it’s referred to as the cienca o f the p ap acy, o r o f the p o p e, the in fallible kn o wledge o f the p o p e, o f the same in stitutio n that issued these do cumen ts o f co n q uest. Then tho se en d up bein g the en tire basis fo r the Western so -called civilizatio n that they have erected. So the en d result is a who le system o f do min atio n embo died in the federal In dian law system, an d embo died in the who le mechan istic co n cep tio n o f reality an d all the p ractice that fo llo ws fro m that. It o ccurred to me the o ther day that p eo p le talk a lo t an d justifiably so abo ut the savin g o f the o ld gro wth fo rests. It just seemed to me like it wo uld be an excellen t idea to talk abo ut savin g the o ld gro wth cultures, which are the In digen o us Peo p les’ cultures that have embo died wisdo m an d un derstan din g o ver tho usan ds up o n tho usan ds o f years, an d which p ro vide altern ative mo dels to emp ire an d do min atio n . K atsi Cook: I thin k that’s a very imp o rtan t statemen t that he made. But the bo tto m lin e is that fro m the p ersp ective o f In digen o us Peo p les the p urp o se to save us is because we’re the o n es who kn o w ho w to relate to the earth, to the eco systems, because cultural an d bio lo gical diversity go han d in han d. It’s imp o ssible to un win d a tho usan d years o f that mo n o culture, that mo n o p o listic kin d o f thin kin g. At wo rk here is the very min d-bo dy-sp irit co n tin uum that has been o p p ressed in so man y ways, in each an d every o n e o f us. I thin k the bo tto m lin e is that we n eed to sup p o rt In digen o us cultures all o ver the p lan et an d I’m n o t just talkin g abo ut Mo hawk p eo p le. That’s why, in a co mmun ity like min e, even tho ugh we struggle every day like yo u do to p ut fo o d o n the table an d to get o ur kids health care, at the same time, we co n tribute o ur en ergies to keep in g alive that visio n o f o ur p rimeval mo ther, Sky Wo man . That’s o ur duty o n this earth. So I’m grateful to co me fro m a gen eratio n that p icked that duty up an d didn ’t let it go . Chief Oren Lyo n s, who is o n e o f the carriers o f o ur p ro p hetic traditio n s aro un d the wo rld, is a great leader an d I like what he said to Green p eace. Green p eace staff always ten ds to be co llege-age kids an d they wan ted to kn o w what to do , because they have a “Chicken Little attitude” o f the sky is fallin g! The reality is that there is o n ly so much that we can do , but p art o f what we’re sup p o sed to do is to main tain that cultural in tegrity—gen eratio n to gen eratio n —o f o ur In digen o us values an d ways o f life. In o ur p itifully sho rt time here o n this earth, we are to main tain tho se cycles o f co n tin uo us creatio n . Life exists o n a co n tin uum; it is all abo ut the co n tin uity. I thin k the key message is resp ect fo r life. Q uestion: I wan t to tell yo u an en viro n men tal justice sto ry with a twist. I live here in Marin Co un ty, which is very beautiful an d o n e o f the mo st affluen t co un ties in the co un try. We have the highest rate o f breast can cer in the wo rld. We were to ld that we do because we are rich, white, an d educated. So I started an o rgan izatio n called Marin Breast Can cer Watch. Our p urp o se was to fin d o ut why we have the highest rate. I’ve always believed that it was the en viro n men t. Yo u can ’t see it here, but so methin g is really, really wro n g. We are fin ally gettin g p eo p le to co o p erate with us. In the begin n in g n o bo dy wo uld co o p erate. They said, “It’s imp o ssible. Lo o k at ho w beautiful this p lace is.” So , it’s imp o rtan t that we can all wo rk to gether, because it’s in the co mmun ities o f co lo r, it’s in the co mmun ities o f p o o r an d rich an d we’re all co lo r. We all have so methin g o f co lo r, so we n eed to wo rk to gether if we’re go in g to survive. I just wan ted to say that en viro n men tal justice issues hit all o f us. K atsi Cook: The issue o f to xic co n tamin atio n isn ’t abo ut p retty o r n o t p retty either. On e o f the first thin gs I learn ed wo rkin g in this was tryin g to get scien tists to mo ve. I started lo o kin g at the research o f a wildlife p atho lo gist who fo un d dead o wls alo n g the St. Lawren ce River an d when he tested their tissues, he fo un d ho rren do us amo un ts o f PCBs in their livers an d brain s. To o ur p eo p le, the o wl is a messen ger o f death. This p atho lo gist sho wed slides o f the Hudso n River Valley—beautiful o rchards, lo vely go lf co urses—an d it turn s o ut, he says, these are all to xic ho t sp o ts. So it’s easy to be seduced by the cultural thin g that everythin g is sup p o sed to be man icured an d p retty an d green an d n ice-lo o kin g, red ap p les. It’s a seductive thin g, but yo u’re right. It’s everywhere. Co n tamin an ts mo ve thro ugh the air, witho ut a p assp o rt.

I’m lucky en o ugh right n o w to have the o p p o rtun ity an d the ability to just p ick up an d go wherever I wan t to . I’ve been thin kin g abo ut go in g to a reservatio n an d sayin g, “Hi, can I help ?” Do yo u thin k that wo uld be welco me? Do yo u thin k it wo uld be help ful?

PART FIVE Yo u A re Wh e re Yo u E at: Nati ve Fo o d s an d Trad i ti o n al A g ri cul ture 1 8 From the First to the Last B ite: Learning from the Food Knowledge of Our A ncestors Jo hn Mo ha wk The idea o f Origin al In structio n s an d In digen o us Kn o wledge co mes o ut o f a co n versatio n that’s been go in g o n fo r at least thirty years. I’m go in g to amalgamate histo ry so yo u get a p icture o f what we’re talkin g abo ut n o w. Befo re there was a Co lumbus, In dian Natio n s an d Peo p les o ccup ied areas sp ecific to themselves, so methin g we might describe as a cultural eco regio n , an d in side that, they had lo ts o f thin gs that they en co un tered: p lan ts an d an imals an d micro en viro n men ts all o ver the co n tin en ts, differen t lan dscap es, differen t seaso n s—a min d-bo gglin g array o f thin gs. Even in a given small area, o n e gro up sharin g the same lan guage an d havin g the same techn o lo gies wo uld live in an area fo r a very lo n g time. In that area they had to make cho ices abo ut ho w they were go in g to exp en d their en ergies, ho w they were go in g to survive in the area they lived in . There were hun dreds o f cultures in hun dreds o f these little bio regio n s, cultural bio regio n s, an d they all did thin gs differen tly. But they all shared o n e thin g in co mmo n : They stayed in the same p lace with the same an imals an d the same p lan ts fo r so metimes hun dreds o f gen eratio n s. They lived in these co n ditio n s befo re an ybo dy tho ught o f havin g a mo n ey eco n o my. That mean t that their behavio rs were p redicated o n co n cern s o ther than mo n ey. So what were these o ther co n cern s? First o ff, I’d like to p ro p o se that man y In dian Natio n s lived in areas where they had to make man y cho ices abo ut vario us thin gs. These were two essen tial areas that are also o n p eo p le’s min ds to day: they had to make a lo t o f cho ices abo ut what p lan ts an d/o r an imals they were go in g to use fo r medicin es an d what p lan ts an d an imals they were go in g to use an d p o ssibly cultivate fo r fo o d. To my kn o wledge, n o o n e ever fo un d a p lan t that had a medicin al use that the In digen o us Peo p les who lived there ( an d lived with that p lan t) didn ’t kn o w abo ut. An ywhere. No o n e ever fo un d o n e. When they fo un d so methin g, they usually had to ask the lo cals, What’s this go o d fo r? The lo cals, if they felt like it, wo uld tell them, Well, yo u kn o w, that’ll cure p o iso n ivy o r whatever, it is a medicin e. What did that mean in terms o f their p ro cess o f deductio n , o f disco verin g that so me rare p lan t was go o d fo r a p articular use in medicin e? The o n ly thin g that we can be sure o f is that they sp en t a lo t o f time exp erimen tin g o n that. Yo u co uld assume so me o f them sp en t tho usan ds o f years exp erimen tin g o n it. If yo u have en o ugh trials, o n ce in a while yo u’ll have a success, right? If yo u’re go o d en o ugh at memo rizin g the success, yo u have man y cho ices to make. In medicin e, the cho ices are daun tin g. What p lan t do yo u use? What p a r t o f a p lan t do yo u use? When do yo u ha r ves t the p lan t? Ho w do yo u use it; do yo u swallo w it? Do yo u rub it o n ? What d o yo u do with it? Maybe yo u just dan ce aro un d it, who kn o ws? With an y given illn ess, there wo uld p ro bably be tho usan ds o f p lan ts, ten s o f tho usan ds o f p a r ts o f p lan ts an d n umero us ways to treat with them —fro m a p o ultice to an elixir to co n sump tio n o f that p lan t. Therefo re, a lo t o f decisio n s had to be made. So meho w they whittled tho se do wn an d by the time mo st o f us heard abo ut them, they said, here’s ho w yo u use this p lan t fo r this p urp o se, which I say is a versio n o f In digen o us Kn o wledge. They did all that exp erimen tal wo rk fo r us, an d we in herited the en d result o f that exp erimen tatio n , that n ative scien ce. An d that is In digen o us Kn o wledge. What I fin d mo st in terestin g is In digen o us Kn o wledge abo ut fo o d. I’m go in g to lo o k at a co up le o f sp ecific examp les, but p lease do n ’t fo rget that there are tho usan ds o f In dian s livin g in tho usan ds o f en viro n men ts. These are the p rin cip les—the sp ecifics are very diverse an d very in terestin g. Where I co me fro m, p eo p le were very vigo ro us ho rticulturalists. They raised at least twen ty differen t varieties o f co rn an d p ro bably mo re varieties o f bean s. They had sq uash, go urds, an d melo n s o f man y differen t kin ds. So at the time o f the alleged co n tact, they raised a fair garden o f p lan t fo o ds. They had mo re cho ices than we have n o w. To day yo u go to the gro cery sto re an d yo u’re lo o kin g fo r co rn . Ho w man y differen t kin ds o f co rn can yo u have? On e o r two , right? Yo u can have white sweet co rn o r yello w sweet co rn , an d the o n ly o ther kin d o f co rn yo u can get is chicken co rn . Mo st o f yo u p ro bably wo uldn ’t eat chicken co rn . There’s also p o p co rn . But that’s p retty n arro w co mp ared to what an Iro q uo is garden er wo uld have had to wo rry abo ut because n o t o n ly were there twen ty varieties o f co rn , but there were differen t ways o f eatin g co rn . So metimes yo u p icked the co rn when it was green , so metimes yo u p icked the co rn when it was baby co rn , so metimes yo u p icked the co rn late. Then yo u dried the co rn an d p ro cessed it. Yo u had to hull so me o f it; yo u had to ro ast so me o f it. In my tribal traditio n there are a lo t mo re varieties o f co rn an d man y mo re ways to p ro cess an d co o k co rn than yo u have to day; certain ly there are mo re varieties than the two yo u fin d in the gro cery sto re an d mo re ways to eat it than just bo ilin g it. I’d make a bet that just with o ur white co rn alo n e, there are p ro bably twen ty-five o r mo re differen t ways to eat it. So my p o in t again is that the tribes had a lo t o f cho ices to make. No w with regard to bean s, there was a who le array o f bean s. To day, ho w man y kin ds o f bean s can yo u get when yo u go to the sto re? In Califo rn ia yo u can get mo re bean s than just abo ut an ywhere, an d yet I do n ’t thin k yo u can get ten in Califo rn ia. We’re talkin g heritage bean s here. But, gen erally sp eakin g, if yo u’re in the rest o f the co un try, yo u’ll get yo ur cho ice, yo u can have p in to bean s o r yo u can have kidn ey bean s, they’d have whites, but o n ly abo ut seven o r eight bean s. Ap art fro m bean s, what abo ut green s? A few years ago , yo u were limited to abo ut three o r fo ur, but n o w I see so mep lace yo u can get seven o r eight differen t green s. But just thin k abo ut the In dian s. The green s were just abo ut an ythin g gro win g in the wo o ds that yo u co uld eat an d keep do wn that wasn ’t to o hard to chew. Yo u threw them in a p o t, bo iled them, ate them, an d man y o f these green s had n o t o n ly n utritio n al value but medicin al p ro p erties. So when yo u thin k abo ut ho w man y differen t fo o ds the In dian s ate, I wan t yo u to kn o w that they ate a daun tin g variety o f vegetables an d grain s. Co mp ared to the mo dern diet it is amazin g to thin k o f the variety o f fo o ds that they co n sumed. But what I was to ld in scho o l was that mo dern American agriculture bro ught us mo re cho ices than we had ever had in the histo ry o f man kin d. That was a huge lie. The reality is that the p re-1 4 9 1 In dian s were livin g in a wo rld in which two thin gs were the case. Number o n e is that n o bo dy was whisp erin g in their ear tellin g them what to do , an d n umber two was they lived co mmun ally. In a so ciety where the accumulatio n o f kn o wledge is o n e o f the reaso n s why Elders are revered, it was a go o d idea fo r a p erso n who p assed fo rty to start p ayin g atten tio n to thin gs. If yo u’re go in g to be revered as yo u’re gettin g o lder, yo u sho uld kn o w so methin g that’s valuable to the survival o f the p eo p le. So p eo p le, as they go t o lder, actually became mo re an d mo re resp o n sible fo r bein g the rep o sito ry o f kn o wledge o f the gro up . On e o f the thin gs abo ut In digen o us lan guages is that they have a way o f p reservin g kn o wledge in the lan guage. The lan guage wo uld tell yo u thin gs that yo u might wan t to kn o w, o r yo u might n eed to kn o w to survive. The kn o wledge in the lan guage was o ften resp o n sible fo r life an d death. So metimes tribal co mmun ities were in gro up s o f fo rty o r fifty p eo p le, so metimes they were in gro up s o f fo ur hun dred, so metimes in gro up s o f two o r three tho usan d, but the gro up was resp o n sible fo r life an d death. Fro m the mo men t yo u were bo rn , they were resp o n sible fo r yo u. No t yo ur mo ther, but the who le gro up . Fro m the mo men t yo u’re bo rn , they’re all p ayin g atten tio n ; it’s usually wo men who are p ayin g atten tio n to yo u when yo u’re very small. As yo u get o lder, esp ecially if yo u’re a male, then the males take o ver at so me p o in t. So everythin g that ever hap p en s to yo u is watched. When yo u’re small, if yo u do n ’t thrive, they n o tice. If they feed yo u so methin g an d yo u do n ’t thrive, they n o tice. If they feed yo u so methin g else an d yo u do thrive, they n o tice. Every sin gle p o ssibility that they have at their fin gertip s can be tried; they are mo tivated to watch an d see which fo o ds help p eo p le the mo st. No t which fo o ds help p eo p le make mo n ey, which fo o ds have the best bio lo gical imp act, esp ecially o n yo un g p eo p le, an d o ld p eo p le. Here’s a so ciety that wo uld rightfully co n sider the idea that fo o d is a medicin e altho ugh to me this is o bvio us. I’ve been in a ho sp ital an d they’ll kill yo u fro m the kitchen . They clearly do n ’t believe that fo o d is a medicin e. Whatever medicin e they’re givin g to yo u the fo o d will co un teract whatever go o d the medicin e is do in g. But this healthcare system is n o t abo ut healin g, it’s abo ut makin g mo n ey. This 1 4 9 1 so ciety was mo tivated to fin d a diet that was the best diet. As a gro up they o n ly had so man y reso urces that they co uld exp an d o n to p ro duce their ideal diet. They co uld o n ly p ro duce so much o f so me thin g, so they had to p ick which co rn they were go in g to p ro duce, which bean s they were go in g to gro w. Essen tially they had to be very strategic abo ut ho w they were go in g to sp en d their time an d en ergy gettin g fo o d. It had to be p ro p o rtio n ate to ho w they saw ben efits co min g fro m the fo o d. An d the o n ly ben efit they were in terested in was the health o f the p eo p le. The o n ly o n e. Health o f the little p eo p le, middle-size p eo p le, o ld p eo p le, but always they’re thin kin g abo ut the health. So here’s a diet that’s based o n the p remise that fo o d is medicin e, that it starts o n yo ur first bite an d en ds with yo ur last bite, literally, an d that the so ciety learn s where it sho uld sp en d its en ergy p ro ducin g which fo o ds. When the so ciety was resp o n sible fo r its o wn health, yo u had to say that they were very careful what it was they gave yo u. I thin k this is why the fo o d value in In digen o us, heritage fo o ds is far greater than the fo o d value in co mmercial fo o d. The fo o d value in co mmercial fo o d is weighed in do llars, an d the fo o d value in heritage fo o ds is weighed in so methin g we might call life fo rce. So meho w it was built aro un d life. Subseq uen tly, yo u co uld live o n an d thrive o n heritage fo o ds by actually eatin g q uite a bit less vegetable matter than yo u wo uld n eed to eat o f co mmercial fo o ds to get the same n utritio n an d life fo rce. I wan t to share o n e sto ry that was strikin g to me years ago back durin g the 1 9 6 0 s, when p eo p le were tryin g to get back to the lan d. Mo ther Ea r th News ran an article abo ut ho w Iro q uo is In dian s lived p retty much o n co rn an d bean s an d sq uash. So , at the time, I had written so me articles an d was co rresp o n din g with p eo p le. A co up le o f p eo p le wro te to me an d they said the fo llo win g thin g. They said, We tried livin g o n co rn . We p lan ted co rn an d all we ate was co rn an d bean s an d we almo st go t sick do in g that. So I wro te back to them, What kin d o f co rn an d bean s? Well, they were p lan tin g essen tially the kin d o f co rn an d bean s yo u co uld o rder at that time o ut o f the seed catalo gs. But the co rn that yo u can thrive o n is the high- lysin e co rn an d the bean s have to be den se. It is the co mbin atio n o f den se bean s an d high-lysin e co rn hulled by lye that p ro duces all the amin o acids yo u n eed to make p ro tein . This has a remarkable q uality: it can be turn ed in to so methin g that a baby can swallo w. It will keep a baby alive when the mo ther’s milk go es dry. Try to fin d that with an y o ther vegetable-based fo o ds. With Iro q uo is In dian s when a mo ther’s milk wen t dry, they fed the baby a derivative o f co rn ; it’s the stuff the co rn bread is bo iled in . It’s n o t that differen t fro m what will hap p en with an imals. On e time a ho rse go t lo o se at this farm an d he wan dered o ff an d p assed by a q uarter mile o f yello w co rn to co me o ver an d eat white co rn . The ho rse was a go urmet. He didn ’t eat just an y co rn , he wan ted the best co rn . Ho rses an d co ws can tell what’s go o d fo r them. So can we if we listen to o ur bo dies an d o ur in stin cts. But p eo p le can ’t fo llo w tho se in stin cts an ymo re, at least in dividual p eo p le can ’t. But there was a time when tribes co uld, when a gro up livin g in a p lace fo r a lo n g p erio d o f time treated fo o d like medicin e an d acq uired a certain amo un t o f kn o wledge abo ut this. After lo o kin g at the examp les cited abo ve, we ask o urselves again , what is In digen o us wisdo m an d kn o wledge? In digen o us wisdo m an d kn o wledge is that wisdo m an d kn o wledge that o ur p eo p les had when they were in charge o f their o wn survival, an d that they retain ed gen eratio n thro ugh gen eratio n . I wan t to p o in t to two p ieces o f wo rk that yo u can lo o k at that I fin d very co mp ellin g abo ut this fo o d sto ry. The first is Westo n Price’s bo o k o n n utritio n an d degen erative diseases.1 He was a do cto r ( den tist) who wro te in the 1 9 3 0 s. He n o ticed that when he was with p rimitive p eo p le, he was q uite amazed that they all had p retty go o d teeth. He wo uld have tho ught that p rimitive p eo p le, n o t havin g den tists, wo uldn ’t have go o d teeth. It turn ed o ut it was the wealthy p eo p le who had den tists who had bad teeth an d the p rimitive p eo p le had go o d teeth. Then he wen t o ff to disco ver that p rimitive p eo p le who ate their o wn fo o ds didn ’t have the degen erative diseases that were co mmo n to p eo p le in the cities o f No rth America—they didn ’t have high blo o d p ressure, they didn ’t have diabetes, they didn ’t get circulato ry ailmen ts, they did n o t die o f co ro n ary heart disease. So he wro te this up in a n o w classic bo o k. If yo u’re in terested in this to p ic, yo u’ve go t to read this bo o k. Price was such a q uain t character. He traveled the wo rld an d he fo un d o n e gro up o f In digen o us Peo p les after an o ther, an d in vestigated their health. He’s bo therin g them, he takes p ictures o f them, he makes them sho w their teeth, an d then he asks them q uestio n s abo ut ho w they live. He fin ds o ut that their co usin s who mo ve in to the city get all these bad diseases an d he was the first to do cumen t that. He go es to o n e p lace after the o ther, fro m Alaska to New Zealan d to Africa to all o ver the wo rld. He dragged his wife all o ver the wo rld to go lo o k an d see if all the In digen o us Peo p les had go o d teeth, an d he fo un d o ut they did. It’s a wo n derful bo o k. But, p art o f the reaso n it’s so wo n derful is because he do esn ’t have an y agen da excep t to an swer his q uestio n . He’s n o t wo rkin g fo r Mo n san to . He’s n o t wo rkin g fo r an y o f the big drug co mp an ies. He’s just tryin g to fin d o ut why p eo p le have go o d teeth an d go o d health. Ho w refreshin g. The n ext o n e is a n ew bo o k that’s just o ut. It’s called The Chin a Stud y; it’s a 2 0 0 5 bo o k.2 The Chin a Stud y is a study o f eighty-six co un ties in No rthern Chin a do n e o ver a p erio d o f twen ty years. It’s the largest study o f the relatio n ship between n utritio n an d health ever do n e. It was do n e with the co o p eratio n o f the Chin ese go vern men t. There’s o n e co un ty at least in Chin a where there’s n o reco rded in ciden t o f death fro m co ro n ary heart failure. No o n e ever died o f a heart attack in this co un ty in Chin a. They’ve go t reco rds that go back fo rever. No bo dy ever died o f that. In the o ther co un ties it’s q uite rare an ybo dy dies o f that. Very rare that an ybo dy dies o f can cer. Very rare that an ybo dy dies o f an y circulato ry disease o r diabetes-related ailmen ts. He calls the diseases that kill p eo p le in the develo p ed wo rld the diseases o f affluen ce because the p eo p le who live in Chin a have very little mo n ey to buy meat. If yo u’ve ever been to real Asia, yo u’ll n o tice that their restauran ts are n o t like Asian restauran ts in America. Yo u o rder a dish in America, say yo u have Chin ese fo o d. What is it? It’s a big p ile o f chicken . Or it’s a big p ile o f beef. When yo u go to Chin a an d o rder fo o d, it’s a big p ile o f vegetables. Yo u’ve go t to dig aro un d lo o kin g fo r the meat. It’s like there’s just the o n e p ig fo r o n e tho usan d meals in Chin a. The p o in t bein g that in Chin a they ate a lo t less meat, an d there is p ractically n o p ro cessed fo o d there; they gro w mo st o f their fo o d themselves. So in Chin a, yo u ask yo urself, what’s killin g them? In Chin a p eo p le die fro m diseases that are asso ciated with p atho gen s—bugs. Here, we kill o urselves with o ur p attern s o f eatin g an d stress. If p eo p le have a lo n g p erio d o f time to p ay clo se atten tio n to n ature an d they do n ’t have an y hierarchical autho rity figure tellin g them what to do , they will make cho ices in their diet that are based o n the o utco me o f their cho ices. Did the p eo p le thrive o r did they n o t thrive? Which o f these fo o ds did they thrive o n best, an d ho w can we take advan tage o f kn o win g this? We get back to No rth America an d I esp ecially like the agricultural area o f No rth America because I kn o w it the best. Yo u can lo o k at the No rth American diets an d yo u can see a real stro n g p arallel between them an d the Chin ese diet; it’s all ro ugh fo o d. If yo u eat real co rn , bean s, an d sq uash, that is a p retty den se, heavy meal. It’s n o t salad. Yo u do n ’t n eed a lo t to keep yo urself go in g o n that. If yo u study Iro q uo is histo ry o r the Algo n q uin p eo p les aro un d them, they have a wo rd in the lan guage that mean s “a gen eratio n .” It says that in three gen eratio n s, such an d such wo uld hap p en . So I o n ce asked a who le gro up o f elder Elders, eighty-five years an d o lder: Ho w man y years wo uld p eo p le live? The Sen eca versio n o f that was a life sp an o f abo ut a hun dred years. When I first heard that, I tho ught that was kin d o f a lo n g life sp an , but I also sp en t a lo t o f my time studyin g histo ry. Thro ugho ut histo ry, a lo t o f p eo p le lived to be a hun dred years. A hun dred years wasn ’t un co mmo n at all. No t o n ly that, they were p retty vigo ro us in their n in eties. I always liked the sto ry abo ut this o n e chief, his n ame was Co rn Plan ter. He lived o n the Co rn Plan ter reservatio n , an d he made a famo us sp eech. Everybo dy lo o ks at the sp eech, which he o p en s by talkin g abo ut the In dian wars that wen t o n in the West. He says, It’s gettin g harder fo r me to get to these meetin gs. He says, I’m n o t sure I’m go in g to keep co min g an ymo re. Acco rdin g to my calculatio n s he was n in ety-seven o r n in ety-eight. He had walked fro m the Co rn Plan ter reservatio n to Buffalo Creek, abo ut 1 1 0 miles. No bridges. When yo u get to the stream, yo u have to swim acro ss the stream an d the n ext p lace. He didn ’t have a ho rse, acco rdin g to the reco rd. He walked. No w, a n in ety-seven -year-o ld guy who can walk that far, we o ught to be listen in g to what else he do es. When we talk abo ut In digen o us Kn o wledge an d Origin al In structio n s, fo r it to mean so methin g, we have to lo o k at what were the behavio rs that p eo p le ado p ted an d what were the ben efits o f tho se behavio rs an d what can we learn fro m studyin g ho w they lived an d what they did. In o ur times, with very high rates o f diabetes an d diseases, we’re p ro bably very mo tivated to embrace that kin d o f kn o wledge. Durin g the p erio d o f fo rced assimilatio n , In dian s were stro n gly urged to believe that their p eo p le had n o kn o wledge, that they co uldn ’t thin k clearly, that they were savages, an d so o n . My exp erien ce is that the reverse is true. To day they have n o kn o wledge an d they’ve embraced a system o f faith: faith that the gro cery sto re fo o d is go o d fo o d, faith that the do cto r says he kn o ws what to do fo r yo u. Yo u have a faith, but yo u’re n o t en co uraged to do what yo u n eed to do to avo id gettin g sick, an d yo u’re n o t en co uraged to do what yo u n eed to do to stay healthy. Preven tio n an d main ten an ce are n o t there o n ce yo u’re in the acculturated wo rld. But n o w we’re at a time when all o f us can rethin k this because there’s a gen eral mo vemen t to ward the idea that fo o d is medicin e. That’s what the Slo w Fo o d Mo vemen t is abo ut. A really wide co mmun ity o f p eo p le agrees with that. To day we can say thin gs like: we sho uld lo o k at eatin g differen tly an d maybe eatin g fo o ds that we do n ’t fin d in a gro cery sto re; maybe we have to gro w so me o f o ur o wn fo o ds. To day yo u do n ’t get q uite the derisive lo o ks yo u used to get. So , I thin k that’s what In digen o us Kn o wledge mean s in actio n . Because I sp en d so much time wan derin g aro un d with traditio n al tribal p eo p les, there’s q uite a lo t o f that accessible to us in all these differen t cultures. Peo p le left sto ries an d they left reco rds abo ut ho w they did thin gs, what they did, what they ate, ho w they p rep ared their fo o d, where they go t their fo o d fro m, an d so o n . They talk abo ut ho w they used medicin e. It’s available to us, it’s n o t lo st. It’s just n o t bein g used.

By the en d o f the retreat we created a visio n statemen t fo r o ur co llective wo rk: “Reco gn izin g the serio usly un balan ced state o f In digen o us health, we reso lve to p ro mo te an d dissemin ate a rein tegrated visio n an d ho listic p ractice o f Native health an d healin g fo r the twen ty-first cen tury.” The seco n d co n feren ce was a n ative fo o ds thin k tan k called “Deco lo n izin g o ur Bo dies, No urishin g Our Sp irits.” This p hrase has beco me a cen tral theme an d fo cus o f my wo rk as a scho lar an d activist an d fo r the health p ro grams o f the Cultural Co n servan cy. In p artn ership with the Wo o dfish In stitute an d the Occiden tal Arts an d Eco lo gy Cen ter we created a five-day n ative fo o ds thin k tan k to examin e the n eed to revitalize o ur In digen o us fo o d traditio n s. We reviewed an d discussed tribal fo o d ren ewal effo rts such as the wo rk o f the Tao s Fo o d Cen ter in New Mexico , the Wild Rice Camp aign o f the White Earth Lan d Reco very Pro ject, The To ho n o O’Odham Co mmun ity Actio n p ro grams, the Iro q uo is White Co rn Pro ject, an d o ther n atio n al-mo del n ative fo o d p ro grams.

We ho n o red the So uthwest In dian Natio n s as master traditio n al farmers, fo o d p ro ducers, an d chefs an d learn ed abo ut man y excitin g p ro jects fro m the So uthwest. But bein g in n o rthern Califo rn ia, we also ho n o red the amazin g fo o d traditio n s o f the lo cal Co ast Miwo k an d Po mo Natio n s. With Julia Parker, the remarkable an d lo vely Co ast Miwo k/Kashaya Po mo Elder an d kn o wledge keep er extrao rdin aire, we p ro cessed black o ak ( Quer cus Kello gii) an d tan o ak ( Litho car p us den s iflo r a) aco rn s in the traditio n al ways. Sadly, the lo cal tan o ak trees are bein g terribly affected by a disease called sudden o ak death. Tan o ak aco rn s were an d are the p rized aco rn o f the lo cal Po mo , Co ast Miwo k, an d Ohlo n e p eo p les because o f the size, q uality, an d sweetn ess o f the n ut. Tragically, sudden o ak death is destro yin g these trees at a rap id rate. If we care abo ut Califo rn ia In dian fo o d traditio n s, we must educate o urselves abo ut these diseases an d facto rs that are directly imp actin g o ur n ative fo o d so urces. Even with these challen ges, Julia Parker still co llects, p ro cesses, leaches, an d co o ks aco rn s usin g a variety o f traditio n al Califo rn ia In dian metho ds. She carefully in structed us in ho w to shell, p eel, win n o w, grin d, an d p rep are the aco rn meal fo r leachin g o ut the tan n ic acids ( all aco rn s have to be leeched fo r their tan n ic acids) . We then made a san d bed fo r the leachin g p ro cess. After the leachin g was co mp leted, Julia an d her daughter, Lucy Parker, sho wed us ho w to co o k the aco rn meal usin g traditio n al baskets an d ho t ro cks. After an aftern o o n p ro cess o f co llective learn in g an d buildin g co mmun ity, we en jo yed the n utty, delicio us, an d n utritio us aco rn so up . Native fo o ds p rep ared in these traditio n al man n ers taste differen t— so methin g abo ut their q uality an d flavo r go right to yo ur so ul an d n o urish yo u o n a deep er level. On the fo llo win g day we had an o ther in credible Native Califo rn ia In dian feast fro m the n o rthern tribes, the Hup a, Yuro k, an d Karuk Natio n s. Claren ce Ho stler an d his wife, Deb Bruce, bro ught delicio us, p lan k-smo ked Co ho salmo n , seaweed, berry so up , an d aco rn bread. To gether, we then fire ro asted Califo rn ia bay n uts. These bay n uts, also kn o wn as p ep p er n uts, co me fro m the Califo rn ia Laurel tree, also called Myrtle Wo o d. It’s a member o f the Lauraceae family, the same family as the avo cado tree. If yo u lo o k at bay n uts, they lo o k like little avo cado s. Yo u might wo n der if they’re edible. They are an d they are delicio us. Yo u do n ’t eat the flesh, yo u eat the big n ut in side. Yo u ro ast them. They are n utty, sweet, an d cho co laty. They were a majo r fo o d stap le o f the lo cal co astal Califo rn ia In dian p eo p le. We also had Yerba Buen a tea, an d a berry so up mix—huckleberries, thimbleberries, salmo n berries, an d blackberries—fo r dessert. It was a delectable men u o f fin e Califo rn ia In dian cuisin e. Thro ugh han ds-o n wo rk in the kitchen , in garden s, an d with traditio n al wild fo o d p ro cessin g, this gatherin g in sp ired all o f us to again reclaim o ur fo o d traditio n s by gro win g an d co o kin g with lo cal an d n ative in gredien ts. Thro ugh dialo gue an d p resen tatio n s, we reviewed n atio n al mo dels o f n ative fo o d revitalizatio n an d saw what wo rked an d what didn ’t wo rk as well. We also examin ed gap s in o ur un derstan din g an d iden tified areas fo r research, co llabo ratio n , an d imp lemen tatio n . It became clear that a n atio n al n ative fo o ds directo ry wo uld be extremely useful because even when man y n ative p eo p le wan t to use n ative in gredien ts, they have a difficult time accessin g them. So we n eed a cen tral clearin gho use fo r where an d ho w to o btain n ative fo o ds. Over the p ast three years TCC has been wo rkin g with a very excitin g p ro ject called Ren ewin g America’s Fo o d Traditio n s ( RAFT) . The RAFT p ro ject is an o ffsho o t p ro ject o f Slo w Fo o d USA. On e o f o ur p ro ject go als is to resto re the lin k between o ur sen se o f p lace an d o ur sen se o f taste. This is a co llabo rative effo rt o f the RAFT co n so rtium, made up o f seven o rgan izatio n s; with o ver mo re than fo rty-five tho usan d members we are still gro win g. We rep resen t very diverse n o n p ro fit o rgan izatio n s aro un d the co un try. They are: The Cen ter fo r Sustain able En viro n men ts at No rthern Arizo n a Un iversity, who se directo r, the famed ethn o bo tan ist Gary Nabhan , has been the main in tellectual architect an d visio n ary o f this p ro ject; Native Seeds/SEARCH in Tucso n , Arizo n a; Slo w Fo o d USA in New Yo rk; Seed Savers Exchan ge in Deco rah, Io wa; Chef’s Co llabo rative in Bo sto n , Massachusetts; American Livesto ck Breeds Co n servan cy in Pittsbo ro , No rth Caro lin a; an d the Cultural Co n servan cy fro m San Fran cisco , Califo rn ia. All o f o ur diverse o rgan izatio n s are wo rkin g to p ro tect heirlo o m seeds, co n serve n ative eco systems, p ro tect en dan gered breeds o f livesto ck an d p o ultry, p ro mo te sustain able an d healthy cuisin e an d lo cal markets, an d ren ew Native American fo o ds, recip es, an d p ractices. To gether we are co mmitted to main tain in g an d ren ewin g the eco lo gical, gastro n o mic, cultural, an d health an d n utritio n al ben efits o f n ative bio diversity. RAFT is the first co llabo rative effo rt o rgan ized to acco mp lish fo ur main go als. First, we are in ven to ryin g America’s In digen o us edible p lan ts an d an imals; this alo n e is a mo n umen tal p ro ject. To mato es, sun flo wers, man y bean s, sq uash, co rn , chilies—all are In digen o us fo o ds o f No rth America. These are so me o f the In digen o us fo o ds that are in the glo bal market, but there are hun dreds, if n o t tho usan ds, o f o ther n ative fo o d varieties that have fallen o ut o f use, have beco me en dan gered, an d have even beco me extin ct. So we are actively tryin g to revitalize rare, heirlo o m varieties. The p ro ject do cumen ts the fo o ds that have fallen in to disuse an d are at risk o f extin ctio n . We then determin e which are cap able o f bein g resto red, an d we begin p ro jects in p artn ership with fo o d p ro ducers, lan do wn ers, harvesters, retailers, co n sumers, an d chefs. Peo p le in vo lved in co n servatio n bio lo gy o r in the en viro n men tal mo vemen t kn o w that when a sp ecies beco mes en dan gered, it gets listed o n the En dan gered Sp ecies List. Yo u research it. Yo u do cumen t it. Yo u give it sp ecial status. The first thin g yo u do is iden tify what facto rs are causin g its en dan gered status an d what thin gs we can do to sto p tho se facto rs an d create an d facilitate better health fo r the sp ecies. A reco very p lan is then created to lo o k at ways to resto re this en dan gered sp ecies. This is o ften do n e thro ugh an eco system man agemen t ap p ro ach fo r resto ratio n . RAFT is do in g a similar thin g with en dan gered fo o ds o f America. As man y as fo ur tho usan d fo o d varieties an d sp ecies are un iq ue to this co n tin en t. On e-third o f them are eco lo gically o r culturally at risk fo r extin ctio n an d/o r cultural o r culin ary aban do n men t, mean in g they may still be gro win g so mewhere, but the kn o wledge abo ut ho w to gather them, p ro cess them, co o k them, that kn o wledge has beco me en dan gered as well. This is an o n go in g theme o f the wo rk o f the RAFT, Cultural Co n servan cy, Bio n eers, an d o thers, that bio lo gical diversity an d cultural diversity go han d in han d. When o n e beco mes en dan gered the o ther beco mes en dan gered; when o n e is ren ewed, the o ther is ren ewed. When o n e flo urishes, so do es the o ther. We thin k that o n e o f the mo st excitin g ways to save o ur fo o d is by eatin g it. We feel yo u n eed to eat yo ur heritage. Heritage sho uld n o t be clamp ed up o r p ut behin d glass in a museum. Heritage is a dyn amic, livin g, chan gin g thin g. It’s so methin g that we n eed to eat, we n eed to n o urish o urselves with—we n eed to co n sume, digest, an d assimilate. We n eed to celebrate o ur authen tic fo o ds, an d everyo n e can jo in in co n servin g the diversity o f America’s fo o ds. As man y n ative co mmun ities an d traditio n al cultures say, “If yo u do n ’t use it, yo u lo se it.” That’s very differen t fro m the classic p reservatio n mo vemen t, which says, if yo u wan t to save so methin g, lo ck it up , do n ’t use it. In digen o us an d o ther traditio n al cultures kn o w that if yo u wan t so methin g to co n tin ue, to be sustain able, an d be a vibran t, livin g en tity, yo u have to have an active recip ro cal relatio n ship with it. The exp lo itatio n an d co mmo dificatio n that has been hap p en in g with mo st o f o ur n ative lan ds an d waters, o ur fo o d an d n atural reso urces are a typ e o f reso urce min in g that is an tithetical to the Origin al In structio n s o f resp ectful use. An d yet, we can n o t jump to the o ther extreme an d lo ck thin gs up in p reserves, museums, seed ban ks, an d the like witho ut havin g a cultural co n text to sustain these reso urces. RAFT wan ts to redefin e the wo rd co n s umer to n o t just mean a blin d p urchaser in the market-driven , cap italistic eco n o my o r an exp lo iter o f reso urces but, in the eco lo gical sen se, reco gn izin g the fact that all human s have to eat to live an d all livin g bein gs have to co n sume fo o d as p art o f the eco lo gical web o f life. We wan t to tran sfo rm co n sumers in to co p ro ducers o f healthy, lo cal fo o ds. An d in fact, co n sumers to day are already beco min g co p ro ducers o f these rare, heritage fo o ds. Sixty-five p ercen t o f tho se surveyed are willin g to p ay mo re fo r p lace-based heritage fo o ds. The Bio n eers co mmun ity an d man y o thers are clear that they wan t healthier, better fo o ds, an d they’re willin g to p ay mo re fo r them. Of co urse, there’s still class an d race an d o ther eq uity issues we n eed to address so these fo o ds do n ’t just beco me elite fo o ds o n ly fo r the wealthy. That’s why we n eed to develo p p artn ership s with p hilan thro p ists an d p ro ducers an d co ttage in dustries, so that these fo o ds are made as available as p o ssible, esp ecially to the co mmun ities who have suffered fro m imp o sed co lo n ial, eco n o mic, an d health in eq uities ( un fo rtun ately this is mo st o f the p lan et) . On e o f the excitin g thin gs the RAFT p ro ject p ro duced was a RAFT regio n al map o f No rth America’s p lace-based fo o d traditio n s. This was a bo ld remap p in g o f No rth America by iden tifyin g differen t fo o ds as to tem fo o ds fro m the differen t regio n s. Fo r examp le, here in n o rthern Califo rn ia we are o n the edge o f Salmo n Natio n to the n o rth an d what we are callin g Abalo n e o r Aco rn Natio n to the so uth. I’m surp rised to fin d that man y p eo p le still do n ’t kn o w what an abalo n e is. It’s a mo llusk, a gastro p o d, an d a fabulo us fo o d. It’s a delicacy. So me Jap an ese an d high-en d restauran ts serve abalo n e. It’s abo ut seven ty to eighty do llars a p late. It sells fo r as much as o n e hun dred do llars p er p o un d, dep en din g o n certain times o f year, an d yet it was the stap le fo o d fo r the co astal Califo rn ia In dian s. An d so me still dare to call their diets “p rimitive.” This remap p in g exercise is a tho ught exp erimen t an d is n o t a defin itive ren amin g. It is mean t to en gen der thin kin g an d co n versatio n abo ut the n ative, regio n al fo o ds we iden tify with. RAFT do es n o t p resume to sp eak fo r o thers fro m differen t regio n s, esp ecially n ative p eo p les who have tho usan d-year-o ld fo o d traditio n s fro m their differen t eco regio n s an d ho melan ds. This map is an in vitatio n to dialo gue abo ut the co n cep ts o f to tem fo o ds an d fo o dsheds. It is a dyn amic, chan gin g p ro cess. Fo r examp le, at first RAFT n amed the So utheast area “Gato r Natio n ,” but really gato rs were eaten mo re in the Flo rida area. The p eo p le o f Lo uisian a an d Mississip p i iden tify as “Gumbo Natio n ,” so the n ext iteratio n o f the map iden tifies the so utheast area as Gumbo Natio n . Also , as sp ecial an d sacred as the abalo n e is to the Califo rn ia In dian Peo p les an d o ther Pacific Peo p les, it was n o t as widely used in Califo rn ia as the aco rn , so that was chan ged. Mexico sho uld really be in cluded as Co rn Natio n because it is the birthp lace o f that sacred fo o d. The n ew map also in cludes o ur Hawaiian bro thers an d sisters an d iden tifies Hawaii as Taro Natio n . This is an o n go in g, dyn amic, regio n al map that remin ds us o f the fact that we all co me fro m fo o d n atio n s, we all co me fro m watersheds, an d we all co me fro m fo o dsheds. If we start rethin kin g ho w we in teract with o ur fo o d an d see it as an exten sio n o f o ur lo cal eco regio n , we can ren ew o ur sen se o f p lace with o ur sen se o f taste. RAFT is a versatile multiyear, multidimen sio n al, multio rgan izatio n p ro ject. We are learn in g, an d gro win g, an d chan gin g. We welco me all p eo p le to jo in us as members, allies, an d sup p o rters. We also welco me co n structive feedback an d healthy challen ges. There’s ro o m fo r everyo n e in this p ro ject. It’s a big RAFT. The Cultural Co n servan cy’s p articular ro le in RAFT is do cumen tin g, thro ugh audio reco rdin g, o ral histo ries o f Native American culture-bearers fro m differen t fo o d traditio n s. We are then creatin g educatio n al materials thro ugh p rin t an d o n -lin e p ro files o f “sto ries fro m the field,” highlightin g n ative fo o d revitalizatio n successes, challen ges, an d mo dels. Our go al an d ro le is reco rdin g an d do cumen tin g these traditio n s, n o t as museum sp ecimen s but as elemen ts o f livin g, dyn amic cultures an d regio n al cuisin es. We’ve co n ducted in terviews o f traditio n al culture bearers fro m the So uthwest, fro m the No rthwest, fro m Califo rn ia, Hawaii, Vermo n t, an d Lo uisian a, an d we p lan to co n duct additio n al in terviews fro m p eo p le o f o ther fo o d n atio n s acro ss the co un try.

TCC also help ed Native Seeds/SEARCH an d Slo w Fo o d USA in co o rdin atin g a Native Fo o ds Celebratio n an d Retreat in the sp rin g o f 2 0 0 7 at the In stitute o f American In dian Arts ( IAIA) in San ta Fe. It was a n atio n al summit o f n ative fo o d p ro ducers, chefs, an d lan d stewards. Fo r examp le, with my tribe, the An ishin aabe o r Ojibwe, wild rice is a very imp o rtan t sacred fo o d that n eeds to be p ro tected an d used in a go o d, sustain able way.

On e o f the reaso n s why n ative fo o ds have fallen o ut o f use is because we do n ’t kn o w where to fin d them. Who ’s gatherin g them? Who ’s p ro ducin g them?

Ho w can we get healthy, n ative fo o ds in o ur refrigerato rs, in o ur kitchen s, in o ur diets, an d in o ur bo dies?

Ultimately, we wan t everyo n e to kn o w what fo o dshed an d watershed we live in because that kn o wledge reco n n ects us to o ur lo cal bio diversity, to the lo cal fo o ds an d lan d stewards o f o ur ho me regio n s.

CONCLUSION Due to the massive harmful imp acts o f Euro p ean co n q uest an d co lo n izatio n o f the Americas, Native Peo p les have suffered fro m a terrible ho lo caust. This has affected every asp ect o f o ur lives an d it is bein g felt to day in the high rates o f health p ro blems in In dian co un try, esp ecially the alarmin g p revalen ce o f diabetes an d dep ressio n . But these illn esses do n o t affect just Native American s; man y American s o f man y differen t ethn ic gro up s are feelin g the n egative co n seq uen ces o f the lo ss o f heritage fo o ds an d traditio n al ways o f health an d healin g. As Native American s remember an d ho n o r the Origin al In structio n s that fo o d is medicin e an d water is life, we are en gagin g in an excitin g, co llabo rative mo vemen t—the n ative fo o ds mo vemen t—to educate o urselves an d each o ther abo ut the n eed fo r healin g an d return in g to the fo o ds an d medicin es that sustain ed o ur p eo p le fo r tho usan ds o f years.

We also realize that because o f all o f the cultural chan ges o f the p ast five hun dred years, we also n eed to reco gn ize to o ls an d medicin es o f Western ways an d fin d co mp lemen tary ways to utilize traditio n al kn o wledge an d Western scien ce an d medicin e. In p artn ership with the Slo w Fo o d mo vemen t an d o thers, we are chan gin g the way we thin k o f, gro w, eat, an d celebrate fo o d. The Cultural Co n servan cy, as o n e o f man y n o n p ro fit o rgan izatio n s co mmitted to revitalizin g In digen o us health an d fo o ds, has created a n umber o f even ts, to o ls, p ro jects, an d reso urces to help us all deco lo n ize o ur bo dies an d n o urish o ur sp irits.

All the farmers in this area in the mo n th o f August brin g o fferin gs to this hill. In this co mmun ity, co rn is gro wn n ear a river, an d in this area tubers, like p o tato es ( So la n um s p p .) , o ca ( Oxa lis tub er o s a ) , o lluco ( Ullucus tub er o s us ) , an d mashua ( Tr o p a eo lum tub er o s um) are p lan ted. In the higher areas there are n atural p astures fo r grazin g an imals. I’m tellin g yo u abo ut altitudes that ran ge fro m thirty-o n e hun dred to fo rty-two hun dred meters abo ve sea level. At lo wer elevatio n s, co rn is p lan ted, also the tubers, an d up hill there are the n atural grasses. On e hun dred an d seven ty families live in this co mmun ity. Each family has o n an average between seven an d twelve p arcels o f lan d. These small p arcels are n o bigger than fifteen tho usan d sq uare meters. So they have three small co rn p arcels, fo ur o n average o f p o tato es an d o ther tubers, an d also o ther p arcels with o ther cro p s. The climate in the An des is q uite varied. There are two clearly defin ed seaso n s o f the year. There is the co ld dry seaso n . It do esn ’t rain . The p easan ts call this seaso n Us ia y uku. The o ther seaso n is the warm rain y seaso n called Puq uy uku. This is when the cro p s gro w. In the co mmun ity o f Qasan q ay o n e o f the p ro blems is the p resen ce o f the fro sts that damage the cro p s. The farmers have fo un d ways o f avo idin g the fro sts. In the lo wlan ds are the co rn fields, but these co rn fields are mixed with varieties o f q uin o a. Durin g harvest seaso n we see a variety o f differen t kin ds o f co rn . There are man y differen t varieties—dark, o ran ge, reddish. Each o n e o f these varieties has a differen t use. There are co rn varieties fo r direct eatin g, so me fo r makin g co rn beer ( chicha ) , so me fo r ma za mo r r a s ( dessert) . Others are fo r healin g p urp o ses. In additio n to the co rn , sq uash is harvested o ut o f the same field an d there is q uite a variety o f sq uashes. The q uin o as are also fully gro wn . I ap p reciate all o f the varieties o f q uin o a ( Chen o p o dium q uin o a ) . To gether with the co rn , achita ( Ama r a n thus ca uda tus ) is gro wn , which is a kin d o f amaran th. Here also there are a n umber o f varieties. These cultivated fields o f co rn are cared fo r, p rin cip ally, by the traditio n al autho rities fro m the co mmun ity. These yo un g farmers are autho rities that co n tin ually go thro ugh the fields to make sure the cattle do n o t damage the field. They are called Va r a s , ro ds, which are symbo ls o f their autho rity. In gro win g the co rn it is n ecessary to co n verse with the wild p lan ts. On e p lan t we use is a cactus called San cay ( Tr icho cer us p er uvia n us ) . When it do es n o t flo wer, that mean s the rain fall will be lo w. On the o ther han d, when it do es flo wer, it tells us that there will be abun dan t rain . Takin g in to acco un t these sign als, the farmer kn o ws which variety o f co rn to p lan t. But they always p lan t differen t varieties. Even if a rain y year is p redicted by the flo wers o f the Sa n ca y p lan t, farmers will thro w in so me seeds o f dro ught- resistan t strain s. They will be in a smaller p ro p o rtio n , but they’ll still be there. The p eo p le o f the An des kn o w that even the weather is livin g an d has a p erso n ality. It’s a very cap ricio us an imal. It can chan ge at an y mo men t. Fo r this reaso n the farmer uses a mixture o f varieties. As agro n o mists, we always tell the farmer to p lan t o n e kin d o f p lan t. If it’s a go o d year, everythin g will be fin e an d if it’s a bad year it’s n o t go in g to be wo rth an ythin g an yway. On the o ther han d, the farmer with his mixture o f p lan ts, whether it’s a go o d year o r if it’s a rain y o r if it’s a dry year, he is still go in g to have so me harvest, even if it’s a small o n e. The farmer is always resp ectful o f n ature. There is a ritual fo r p lan tin g co rn . The farmers p rep are a table where the o fferin gs fo r the Pa cha ma ma ( Mo ther Earth) are laid o ut. There are flo wers, seeds, fruits, which will be resp ectfully an d carefully buried in the gro un d. The co mmun ity do es all o f the wo rk to gether. This co mmun ity effo rt is called Ayn i. All o f the fields are cultivated co mmun ally. The Ayn i is p erfo rmed jo yfully. It is a p arty. Also in this area cha q uita q lla are still used. They are small han dheld ho es o r p lo ws. They are used to o p en up n ew gro un d. Often little bo ys, five o r six years o ld, help to turn the earth. So they begin to wo rk with their fathers an d bro thers at a very early age. But they take it like a game. Higher up where the p o tato fields are fo un d there are o ther cro p s like barley, which is an in tro duced cro p . In the p o tato fields, varieties are p lan ted to gether. Durin g the flo werin g, it is p o ssible to see differen t co lo rs o f flo wers. That’s tellin g us that it is a mixture. If we see these differen t kin ds an d co lo rs o f flo wers, it mean s there are differen t varieties. In the harvest, we fin d differen t kin ds o f p o tato es. So me varieties are resistan t to excess rain . Others are dro ught-resistan t. As I’ve said befo re, there is always a mixture p lan ted. Other tubers, such as o ca, are also p lan ted. It is similar to the p o tato , but with a sweet flavo r. It is very p o p ular in all the families. Here again , there is a variety o f o cas—black, red, p in k, yello w, white. So there’s a great diversity, a great diversity because the An dean climate is so variable. Also , with the p lan tin g o f the p o tato , the wild p lan ts are talked to . Thro ugh the flo werin g o f the sp in y bush Ta q s a n a we are to ld whether it’s go in g to be a wet o r a dry year in the p o tato -gro win g area. This is seen thro ugh a greater o r lesser amo un t o f flo werin g. The stars are also co n sulted. We esp ecially co n sult with the Pleiades, which in Quechua is called Suchu. At fo ur in the mo rn in g aro un d Jun e 2 4 , n ear the Jun e so lstice, the farmers o bserve when the co n stellatio n co mes up in the sky. If it is very bright it is go in g to be a wet year. If the stars are o p aq ue, it will be a dry year. But it is a mo re subtle co n versatio n than that. The curio us farmers, tho se who kn o w ho w to co n verse well with the stars, can differen tiate the shin e o f the stars high in the sky, in the middle ran ks, o r clo ser to the ho rizo n . When the high stars shin e mo re yo u have to advan ce the so win g. If the lo w stars shin e mo re, the so win g sho uld be delayed. If the middle stars are the brightest, the p lan tin g is do n e at the accusto med time. The farmer p lan ts everythin g. He is n o t a sp ecialist in an ythin g. In the same family there are differen t kin ds o f co rn , p o tato es, o ca, o lluco , an d mashua. In additio n , there are differen t kin ds o f q uin o a. The farmer p lan ts p rin cip ally to eat. In the highest area are the n atural grasses, also co n tain in g a mixture o f varieties. Here we also fin d llamas. No w, sheep an d co ws are also raised, but so are llamas. This allo ws the farmers to take their p ro duce to differen t co mmun ities fo r trade. They can trade co rn fo r llama meat. These llamas have differen t co lo red ear tags. They also have so me small bells. With these bells they call the sp irits o f fo o ds. When they are carryin g co rn fro m o n e co mmun ity to an o ther, they n o t o n ly brin g the co rn but they also brin g the co rn sp irit, because the sp irit is what n o urishes. There are also rituals fo r the raisin g o f livesto ck. Fo r the farmers, the llamas are o n lo an fro m the Ap us. As men tio n ed earlier, o ften a table is p rep ared fo r the Ap us by p lacin g differen t seeds an d p lan ts o n it. So me o f these cultivars are very o ld. They can be fo un d o n ceramics fro m sixteen hun dred years ago . We use q uin o a, o lluco , mashua, an d co rn . So metimes this symbo lic ritual, in cludin g a cultivatio n o f the so il, is carried o ut o n p latfo rms. This hap p en s in the Co lca Valley in Areq uip a. ( There are o ther ways o f cultivatin g, fo r examp le, terracin g is used in Cuzco , where the so il is used all the way fro m the river o n up to the to p o f the hills.) I was bo rn in the Man taro Valley. Man y p o tato es are gro wn there. While the p lan ts are in flo wer the farmers ado rn themselves with the flo wers. Then after wo rk the farmers rest. They are deco rated with flo wers an d their faces are ritually p ain ted. All o f the wo rk is do n e to music. When the wo rk is o ver they dan ce aro un d the fields, en din g in a p arty. An dean farmin g is always do n e in co n versatio n with the wild p lan ts, which tell them ho w to have a better harvest. A sp ecial flo wer fo r us is ca n tuta ( Ca n tua b uxifo lia ) , the ho ly flo wer o f the In cas. When yo u see this flo wer, it is a stro n g sign . Everythin g is always askin g p ermissio n fro m the Ap us. In this case, the ap u is Ausan gati, which is the mo st imp o rtan t ap u n ear Cuzco . Near the Jun e so lstice fo rty to fifty tho usan d farmers gather ritually fo r a who le week an d go up to the mo un tain . We do n ’t go up the mo un tain to p ray—we An dean s do n ’t p ray. We dan ce fo r the Ap us.

When I first started wo rkin g in this field almo st two decades ago , the fibers that co n n ect traditio n al an d co n temp o rary educatio n fo r Native Peo p les so o n became eviden t to me. Had I seen a way to live the dyn amic, p hysical life that my great-gran dp eo p le lived—fishin g, hun tin g, gro win g, an d gatherin g their o wn fo o d—I wo uld have cho sen the same.

It to o k a deliberate p ause fo r me to un derstan d what I was lo o kin g at, an d it was in this susp en ded sp ace that I realized that at least two differen t ro ads, traditio n al scien ce an d Western scien ce, wo uld have to meet to mitigate the damage. In my p erso n al, co mmun ity life, I am an o cean -fo o d gatherer. This is so methin g that I was reared to do , sup p o rted by a cadre o f skilled elder relatives an d my p aren ts. My family devo ted co n siderable time to en surin g that their children kn ew ho w to do thin gs. Our in structio n s in cluded learn in g the basics: ho w to descen d a cliff safely while p ackin g fishin g gear; ho w to walk a ro cky sho re an d n avigate the slip p ery in tertidal zo n e; ho w to see with o n e’s han ds un derwater; ho w to take life with care. Delivered with p atien ce an d laughter, these lesso n s have been a so urce o f stren gth fo r me thro ugho ut my life. The sen se memo ries that acco mp an y these lesso n s an cho r them to p articular p laces. The co n n ectio n with a sp ecific eco system an d the kn o wledge that I can p ro vide fo r myself an d my family is imp o rtan t to me. What was at o n e time a co mmo n p lace seaso n al fo o d cycle fo r us is n o w so methin g tremen do usly p recio us. My family still en jo ys mussels every fall, fresh sea green s every win ter, abalo n e every sp rin g. The abalo n e, big marin e sn ails, are sp arse amo n g the ro cks n o w. When I was a small child they were so p len tiful that they wo uld clin g ato p each o ther un der the ro cks fo r lack o f sp ace. Out o f the eight sp ecies o f Hal i o ti s o n ce p len tiful alo n g the Califo rn ia co ast, o n ly the red abalo n e, Hal i o ti s r uf es cen s , survives at a level where the regulato ry agen cy, Califo rn ia Dep artmen t o f Fish an d Game, still allo ws human harvest o f them, an d then o n ly alo n g the n o rthern stretch o f the state. When I’m in the water, feelin g fo r legal abalo n e ( seven in ches fro m tip to tip ) I am also co un tin g the co min g gen eratio n , the smaller shells. I thin k o f all the tribal p eo p les alo n g the co ast who n o lo n ger have access to the abalo n e, o n e o f the an imals that has been o n the earth fo r a very lo n g time. What traditio n s wan e when a sp ecies is lo st? What wo rds go away? What are the sp iritual rep ercussio n s when so meo n e who lo o ms large in yo ur earliest histo ries leaves yo ur wo rld? It seems that every day, so mewhere, o ur relatives leave us. Human fo lk are treatin g the p lan et as if a better o n e is co min g o n the market so o n . So me sp ecies kn o w their p lace an d their cycles by sp ecific features in bo th lan d an d water. These ro admap s are o ften altered by the fo lly o f human s so in vested in thin kin g big that they fo rget to thin k small. We must remember ho w to thin k small. Fo o d gro win g, gatherin g, an d harvestin g en tail a level o f detailed o bservatio n .

Peo p le resp o n sible fo r fo o d take sto ck o f the little thin gs. They n o tice the p ebble in the ho o f o f a draft ho rse. Their eyes are drawn to the n ew p lan t that sho o ts up , seemin gly o ut o f n o where. They kn o w that the ro ck remo ved fro m the tidep o o l’s rim causes a co mp lete shift in that shimmerin g circle. The small thin gs an cho r the web o f life. When we mo ve away fro m o ur fo o ds, fo r whatever reaso n , we get in to tro uble. Reflectin g o n what we have available in o ur diets to day, an d ho w differen t that was fro m the times o f o ur gran dp aren ts an d o ur great- gran dp aren ts, sho ws us ho w much less healthy we are n o w, given the fo o ds that are p art o f o ur daily diets. Witho ut a co n scio us effo rt to disco ver the fo o ds that are really healthy fo r all o f us, it’s easy to get sucked in to a deep - fried an d breaded kin d o f wo rld. The cheap co st o f bad fo o d makes it mo re difficult to get the fo o ds that are truly healthful fo r us. We gro w n umb to the lives behin d the fo o d, the mean s o f p ro ductio n , the co st o f distributio n , the co st to the lan d. This is o n e area where havin g a Western educatio n can be truly help ful. On e gain s a n ew vo cabulary an d access to o ther reso urces that can help to co mp rehen d the ho rro rs bo rn e by the lan d an d sea in the in terest o f co mmercial fo o d p ro ductio n .

They can help frame the p ro blems, n o t o n ly in terms o f scien ce, but within the frames o f health, p o litics, an d justice. Fo r it is un just fo r p eo p le n o t to be able to have their n ative fo o ds. It creates stealthy, in sidio us gen o cides. The p hysical activity o ften asso ciated with fo o d p ro curemen t ceases. Pro cessed fo o ds are o ften ill-attun ed to tribal bo dies. Yo u see the resultin g effect o n the Native p o p ulatio n s n o w. A great man y o f us are afflicted with diabetes, hyp erten sio n , gall bladder disease, an d o ther p ro blems. Thin gs that are hap p en in g in the Un ited States an d Can ada are hap p en in g in o ther areas where there is severe dietary disrup tio n . This is bigger than the p ro blem o f the children thin kin g that milk co mes fro m carto n s. Do we really n eed a “sup ermarket to the wo rld?” Everywhere I’ve been able to visit acro ss Native America in the last few years, I’ve been stun n ed an d dismayed at ho w man y In digen o us fo o ds an d fiber p lan ts are go n e, an d when yo u ask the children abo ut these fo o ds, so me may kn o w o f them but they have n o t always had a chan ce to taste them.

There’s so methin g p ro fo un dly sad abo ut rememberin g fo o ds that yo u can n o lo n ger have access to an d n o lo n ger eat.

We are taught that if we ign o re the p lan ts an d we ign o re the an imals an d we do n ’t talk to them an d use them ( an d vice versa) then o n e o r the o ther o f us will go away.

It used to be mo re widesp read, but as so me o f tho se areas were taken o ut, o r they un derwen t recreatio n al develo p men t o r dredgin g, a go o d p o rtio n o f the rice was destro yed. It’s my un derstan din g that the ran ge o n ce was much greater. I talked to so me traditio n al p eo p le fro m Main e, an d they said in their lan guage they had a wo rd fo r wild rice. But the mo ther lo de o f where wild rice exists in the wo rld is the Great Lakes regio n . The variety there do esn ’t exist an ywhere else in the wo rld. It’s un iq ue. It’s the o n ly n ative No rth American grain . Wild rice is an immen se p art o f an eco system. Remember that Min n eso ta is the lan d o f ten tho usan d lakes. They do n ’t all have rice o n them, but man y do . Fo r Ojibwes, o r An ishin aabeg is ho w we call o urselves, rice is cen tral to o ur histo ry. A lo n g time ago p ro p hets came to us. We were in structed to mo ve fro m the East, because we wo uld p erish. We were in structed to fo llo w the shell that ap p eared in the sky. We sto p p ed in seven p laces alo n g the way, an d the fact is that we are actually very clo sely related to the Wamp an o ags an d the Aben aki an d the Len n i Len ap e. They sp eak the same lan guages we do . So we did o rigin ate there in o ur mo st recen t migratio n , which may have been a tho usan d years ago o r two tho usan d years ago . We mo ved to the p lace where the fo o d gro ws o n the water; this fo o d was wild rice. We were given the gift o f wild rice an d the kn o wledge o f it in a mo n th kn o wn as Ma noominike G iizis, which is the wild rice makin g mo o n . I like to talk abo ut that, because we also have Na meb ini G iizis, the sucker mo o n , an d we have Ona b a G iizis, which is the hard-crusted sn o w mo o n . This sn o w mo o n is in March when it freezes an d thaws. No t everybo dy is o n the Julius Caesar calen dar. We have an immen se amo un t o f wild rice o n o ur lakes. The reservatio n s in n o rthern Min n eso ta were created aro un d the rice beds. Yo u p ut yo ur to bacco o ut, yo ur p rayers o ut, an d then two p eo p le laun ch o ut in a can o e. On e “kn o cks” an d the o ther p ulls. The kn o ckers o n o ur bo at are thirty-in ch- lo n g cedar sticks; they lo o k kin d o f like large drumsticks. The p o le is lo n g, eighteen to twen ty feet, with a duckbill at the bo tto m. This is what yo u use to p ush o ut o n the lake. Yo u can ’t p addle the can o e because fo r the mo st p art the surface o f the lake is q uite thick with rice an d p lan ts. Yo u have to be so mewhat agile an d athletic. When yo u co me in after the harvest, yo u haul in yo ur wild rice, an d yo u p ut it in gun n ysacks. Yo u then take it to yo ur p ro cesso r. We’re the largest p ro cesso r in the area. It is then laid o ut to dry befo re it is p ut in to eq uip men t that will p arch it fo r a co up le o f ho urs. After that yo u let it o ut an d then traditio n ally yo u dan ce o n it to get the hulls o ff. Peo p le do still dan ce, but we also use a basher, which so un ds q uite vio len t. It takes the hulls o ff an d is run by a tracto r mo to r. Then yo u win n o w it. Yo u use a fan n in g mill if yo u’re do in g fifty tho usan d p o un ds, which is what we do . Then yo u so rt it by size. After that yo u have a feast. This is very imp o rtan t. Yo u always feast yo ur rice. We feast all o f o ur harvests. We have a big than ksgivin g feast fo r the first rice, an d we have a big dan ce. We have a wild rice dan ce startin g in August. We also have o ur ceremo n ies an d o ur p o wwo ws. I say that because this is kin d o f the in tersectio n between traditio n al values an d in dustrializatio n . What hap p en ed to us is these an thro p o lo gists came. First they messed us up an d then they came back in the 1 9 2 0 s an d they watched us rice. Sammy Jen ks, an early an thro p o lo gist wo rkin g in Ojibwe territo ry, had this wo rldview, an d his co mmen tary was, “Ho w co uld so majestic a grain be given to such a p rimitive p eo p le? They have to wo rk so little to get it. It’s like Ojibwe Mardi Gras o r a kin d o f an early Christmas p resen t. Then they dan ce an d feast. They’re n ever go in g to beco me civilized, because they are n o t that p ro ductive.” So fro m my van tage p o in t, Jen ks had this view o f what in dustrialized agriculture is abo ut: it’s this sep aratio n o f culture fro m gro win g, as well as a ben t to ward co lo n izatio n . “These p rimitive p eo p le are dan cin g to o much an d sin gin g.” These scien tists set abo ut tryin g to do mesticate wild rice. I do n ’t wan t to say they had a ven detta, but in its o wn way, that’s what it was. They messed aro un d with it at the Un iversity o f Min n eso ta fo r abo ut thirty years. They didn ’t get it do mesticated un til the 1 9 5 0 s. They started gro win g it in diked rice p atties to do mesticate it. By the 1 9 6 0 s, they had created the adven t fo r the p addy rice in dustry an d in the 1 9 7 0 s it really to o k o ff. The un iversity declared that this was a fan tastic acco mp lishmen t o f the Green Revo lutio n . The Un iversity o f Min n eso ta’s q uite in vo lved with the Green Revo lutio n . This is kin d o f their “lo o k what we’ve do n e in Min n eso ta” attitude. Wild rice was declared the state grain in 1 9 7 7 . They p o ured all this mo n ey in to it in Min n eso ta, an d abo ut two years later the majo rity o f the p addy rice in dustry mo ved to Califo rn ia. To day three-q uarters o f all p addy rice that is gro wn is gro wn in diked rice p addies in n o rthern Califo rn ia. We, as Ojibwe, have been in this battle fo r man y years, because yo u can ’t co mp ete with a guy with a co mbin e. They use fertilizers an d fun gicides. The do mesticated p addy rice do esn ’t taste like a lake. It tastes like a p addy. It’s similar to the fair trade issue in co ffee, but differen t. It is a techn o lo gy an d a who le p ro cess cho ice. We started battlin g them in the 1 9 8 0 s, an d in 1 9 8 6 my White Earth reservatio n sued An heuser-Busch. They had a p icture o f two In dian s in a can o e o n a lake full o f wild rice that was called On amia wild rice, which is a ban d o f Ojibwe. The rice was en tirely fro m Califo rn ia, so we sued them. We en ded up with a state labelin g law in Min n eso ta, which req uires that p addy rice p ro ducers in the state o f Min n eso ta must label the p addy rice as “cultivated.” The lo o p ho le is, o f co urse, that yo u can n o t drive the en tire Califo rn ia p ro ductio n thro ugh that. To day millio n s o f p o un ds o f wild rice are p ro duced in Califo rn ia witho ut the labelin g law. It’s ship p ed in to Min n eso ta to get p ro cessed “green .” Then it’s labeled “Min n eso ta p ro cessed” to add to the gro ss misrep resen tatio n o f the p ro duct. In the late 1 9 9 0 s the un iversity to o k up the idea o f gen etic wo rk o n wild rice. The researcher Ro n Phillip s cracked the DNA seq uen ce in 2 0 0 0 an d began the map p in g o f it. All the Ojibwe ban ds an d the Min n eso ta Chip p ewa tribe wro te them a letter that said, “This isn ’t so methin g yo u can tin ker with. This is an essen tial p art o f o ur culture. This is who we are an d we reserve this, an d this is p art o f o ur treaty.” The treaty o f 1 8 6 7 between the U.S. go vern men t an d the Mississip p ie Ban d Chip p ewa established the White Earth Reservatio n an d discussed o ff-reservatio n treaty rights. It sp ecifically said that we had the right to rice, an d to harvest wild rice. The treaty did n o t say that the rice co uld be gen etically en gin eered by o utside p arties. We started battlin g the un iversity in the 1 9 9 0 s an d we’ve been battlin g them ever sin ce. At all o ur traditio n al feasts an d ceremo n ies we have wild rice. We always eat o ur traditio n al fo o ds. I’m n o t a Christian , so I do n ’t have an eq uivalen cy o n this, but we have in structio n s, as Ojibwe p eo p le, o n what it is that is essen tial abo ut bein g Ojibwe. A lo t o f that is related to these fo o ds, an d fo o ds are co n sidered medicin e. We have a resp o n sibility to take care o f all o f o ur fo o ds, an d to en sure their vitality. My o rgan izatio n , the White Earth Lan d Reco very Pro ject, has a p retty wide array o f fo o d-related activities. We make map le syrup . Un til abo ut 1 5 0 years ago , mo st o f the map le syrup came fro m In dian p eo p le. We were the p ro ducers. To day, that’s n o t so . We harvest all o ur medicin es in the wo o ds. Wild rice is really a go o d fo o d fo r an ybo dy who has allergies an d it has a really high n utritio n al co n ten t. It’s high in fiber an d high in vitamin s. The Un iversity o f Min n eso ta has been en gaged in an alyses o f vario us elemen ts o f wild rice. In p articular, they have been lo o kin g at the effect o f it o n cho lestero l. A study that came o ut last year said it had an asto n ishin g effect o n dimin ishin g cho lestero l. So it’s p art o f this dicho to my o f wo rldviews. We wo uld say, “Yo u sho uld eat rice,” an d they wo uld say, “We can create a p ill that has that essen tial elemen t extracted.” Fro m o ur stan dp o in t we kn o w that it has an effect o n us an d so we eat it. My family eats 1 5 0 p o un ds o f rice a year. Fro m o ur van tage p o in t, what we n o tice is that, with the declin e o f traditio n al fo o ds in o ur co mmun ities, because o f lo ss o f access to them, a lo t o f o ur p eo p le go t sick. So to day yo u have a really high level o f diabetes. Abo ut 4 0 p ercen t o f the adults o ver fo rty o n my reservatio n have diabetes. As it turn s o ut, the best medicin e fo r that is these traditio n al fo o ds, alo n g with exercisin g. When the co mmercializatio n o f wild rice hap p en ed in Califo rn ia, there was a huge an d devastatin g eco n o mic imp act o n o ur rice eco n o my an d co mmun ity. My family has always been in vo lved with rice. My father met my mo ther sellin g wild rice. It was the way p eo p le made mo n ey. That’s what Ojibwes ha ve. It’s always been a majo r so urce o f trade an d a majo r so urce o f in co me fo r o ur p eo p le. My reservatio n has two o f the p o o rest co un ties in the state o f Min n eso ta. The p eo p le who rice are p eo p le who do n o t have full-time jo bs, an d do n ’t wan t them. They actually wo uld p refer to harvest an d live in the wo o ds. Tho se p eo p le are the p eo p le who are mo st imp acted by this lo ss o f in co me. The adven t o f the p addy rice in dustry to tally destro yed o ur market, which was a small market to start with. I’m n o t o p p o sed to all p addy rice; if Un cle Ben ’s wan ts to sell that n asty o ld stuff, go ahead. Yo u’re go in g to sp en d eight bucks a p o un d, ten bucks a p o un d. Lake-gro wn wild rice is p ro bably go in g fo r twelve bucks a p o un d retail. Native p eo p le are the p o o rest p eo p le in the state o f Min n eso ta an d so me o f the p o o rest p eo p le in the co un try. What we have o n my reservatio n is three thin gs, as we say: we have wild rice, we have win d, an d we have really smart p eo p le. So I feel like we sho uld get the fair value. The p aten tin g o f wild rice o ccurred a few years ago . No rCal Wild Rice ho lds the p aten ts o n a p ro ductio n system o f creatin g sterile males that they created. They do this thro ugh seed selectio n . There’s n o gen etically en gin eered wild rice an ywhere. They did this seed selectio n , an d they created this p aten ted variety. They have two p aten ts. It’s the begin n in g o f o utside en tities o wn in g the gen etics o f the p lan t that has been n urtured by o ur co mmun ity fo r maybe tho usan ds o f years. So that o ccurred an d then a DNA study map p in g the gen o me o f wild rice at the Un iversity o f Min n eso ta also o ccurred. Aro un d 2 0 0 1 we held so me meetin gs in o ur co mmun ities, in cludin g meetin gs with the very traditio n al an d the religio us leaders o f o ur co mmun ities. I bro ught in so meo n e fro m the Cen ter fo r Fo o d Safety who wo rked o n the basmati rice case.*1 1 I kn o w Van dan a Shiva an d I asked her what to do . I to ld her we had a similar p ro blem an d she to ld me who to talk to . We held this meetin g an d exp lain ed to o ur p eo p le. The q uestio n s asked were, “Who gave them that right?” “Ho w’d this hap p en ?” “Did Nan abo zho o give them that right?” ( Nan abo zho o is o n e o f o ur half-man , half-sp irit p eo p le.) The p eo p le were o utraged an d they asked, “What are they do in g?” There was a sup reme rift here. The un iversity co n tin ued o n an d was gen erally p atro n izin g. ( The USDA fun ded the un iversity to map the gen o me.) The un iversity’s resp o n se to us was, “On ce the Ojibwe un derstan d, they’ll be co mfo rtable.” The gen eral argumen t is that basically if we were smart en o ugh we’d be hap p y. The Ojibwe didn ’t really care fo r that. We feel like we’re go o d o n rice. We have a little mo re kn o wledge than the un iversity do es. We have a two -tho usan d- year relatio n ship with the rice, we get it. This is n o t to say that we’re n o t o p en to discussio n s o n kn o wledge but we have o ur own kn o wledge. On so me fun damen tal level there’s this p resump tio n o n the p art o f these researchers at the un iversity that the An ishin aabeg are n o t a vital culture; that we do n ’t chan ge an ythin g. Man y p ercep tio n s an d an alyses o f o ur culture are shallo w. Man y o f these scien tists have n o co n cep t o f who we are. Essen tially, there’s this divergen ce an d this p ercep tio n that we’re p rimitive, which co n tin ues to this day. There is also an assump tio n that so meho w scien ce is in fallible an d that scien ce has a right. Our p ersp ective is that they do n ’t have all rights an d o ur strategy is to q uestio n their assump tio n an d say, “Fro m o ur cultural p ersp ective, yo u do n ’t have all tho se rights.” At so me p o in t there sho uld be a q uestio n o f un iversity ethics. They like to hide behin d this clo ak o f academic freedo m an d tell us that we’re limitin g their academic freedo m. The un iversity p eo p le make claims like “What the Ojibwe are p ro p o sin g to do wo uld restrict o ur ability to co mbat bio terro rism.” I tho ught that was to tally cheatin g. We didn ’t say they co uldn ’t sto p an thrax o r bo tulism. We’re just talkin g abo ut rice. We also have the treaty o f 1 8 6 7 , which backs us up . We have this legal right, which we believe is wo rth so methin g. The Un ited States may n o t believe that treaties are wo rth an ythin g, but we actually believe that o ur treaties are wo rth so methin g. But a larger cast o f the discussio n is that we believe that the mo ther lo de o f bio diversity is wo rth p ro tectin g. In this case, the o n ly p lace where wild rice gro ws p ro ximate to p addy rice is in the state o f Min n eso ta. So what we are sure o f is that they sho uld have n o right to co n tamin ate [by cro ss p o llin atio n o f gen etically en gin eered rice] the n atural lakes o f Min n eso ta. The argumen t that I’m makin g is that p eo p le p ro bably do n ’t wan t ten tho usan d gen etically en gin eered lakes. It turn s o ut that even a very co n servative p ark rep at city co un cil said, “We do n ’t always agree with Win o n a, but she’s 1 0 0 p ercen t right o n this.” Our strategy is an Ojibwe-driven strategy, because that’s o ur resp o n sibility, but in takin g a stan d, I’m also callin g o n Min n eso ta lo yalty to an eco system an d p ride in what it is to be a Min n eso tan . On e o f o ur deep est co n cern s, tho ugh, is Califo rn ia. Califo rn ia has n o sen se o f resp o n sibility to ward the lake rice. So metimes in the marketin g o f Califo rn ia p addy rice, they say that the Ojibwe, o r the In dian s, used to be in vo lved with wild rice—they use the p ast ten se o n so me o f their marketin g. “But n o w the In dian s are go n e.” Like the In dian s are go n e an d mo ved o n an d became Casin o -o wn in g In dian s. Imp lyin g that ricein g was so methin g we used to do , but the fact is that we still do it. Millio n s o f p o un ds o f Califo rn ia p addy rice co me in to Min n eso ta. An d that’s live seed. It’s still green . It’s n o t p ro cessed, an d there’s a risk o f co n tamin atio n . The Un iversity o f Min n eso ta has said that they aren ’t in ten din g to gen etically en gin eer wild rice, but they wan t the right to do that. What I’m after is an ethics agreemen t with the un iversity, because that’s the mo st likely p lace that it wo uld o rigin ate. But, un able to secure such an agreemen t with the un iversity, we in tro duced legislatio n at the Min n eso ta legislature to p ro tect wild rice an d secure a mo rato rium o n gen etic en gin eerin g. The in itial legislatio n called fo r a ten -year mo rato rium o n an y gen etic en gin eerin g o f wild rice. Over the years this was reduced to a two -year ban . After a three-year battle at the legislature an d a lo n g set o f meetin gs with the Un iversity o f Min n eso ta, ma noomin, o r wild rice, fin ally received p ro tectio n an d is o n ce again reco gn ized—n o t o n ly as the mo st sacred fo o d o f the An ishin aabe o r Ojibwe Peo p les but also as the cherished state grain . On May 8 , 2 0 0 7 , Go vern o r Pawlen ty ap p ro ved the Omn ibus En viro n men t an d Natural Fin an ce Bill ( H 2 4 1 0 / S 2 0 9 6 ) ; p ro tectio n fo r wild rice was in cluded in this bill. An drea Han ks, the Wild Rice Camp aign co o rdin ato r fo r the White Earth Lan d Reco very Pro ject exp ressed great relief that the bill had p assed, than kin g all o f tho se who had sup p o rted it. “Pro tectio n fo r Wild Rice has been a lo n g time co min g fo r An ishin aabeg co mmun ities, man y p eo p le o n all levels co n tributed to mo vin g this legislatio n , the tribes o f Min n eso ta, tribal leaders, allied o rgan izatio n s, citizen s an d legislato rs, I’m than kful fo r the help an d sup p o rt that was given ,” she said. My resp o n sibility is to p ro tect o ur rice. I’d like to p ro tect all thin gs, but right n o w this is my jo b. This chap ter is based o n a 2 0 0 6 in terview by Arty Man gan o f Bio n eers an d 2 0 0 7 co rresp o n den ce with LaDuke.

A great deal o f p ro fo un d kn o wledge an d wisdo m—wisdo m we co uld desp erately use to day—was lo st. Abo ut thirty years ago , I was atten din g a meetin g at the On o n daga lo n gho use in New Yo rk, an d the guests at that lo n gho use were fro m Ho p i co un try in Arizo n a. On e o f them, Tho mas Ban yacya, who was a tran slato r fo r so me o f the Elders who had jo urn eyed to us, had a sto ry fro m the Elders to tell. His sto ry was that the wo rld had mo re o r less co me to an en d a few times, but that so me n ative p eo p le had survived, an d they’d co me to be aware that it was an in atten tio n to an d a disresp ect fo r n ature that had been at the ro o t o f their p ro blems. Life o n earth had been threaten ed an d certain ly civilizatio n had been threaten ed because p eo p le had aban do n ed a resp ect fo r n ature. An d n o w this was hap p en in g again . The Elders had sen t Tho mas fo rward to try to exp lain this to the wo rld, to give us all a warn in g. ( At o n e p o in t he even addressed the Un ited Natio n s.) The Elders also said we sho uld lo o k at the white men ’s written reco rds to fin d eviden ce to sup p o rt what they were sayin g. I to o k o n that jo b an d began to do research. I disco vered that the an thro p o lo gists who lo o ked at the Maya civilizatio n an d its very curio us co llap se in the n in th cen tury were p uzzled by what had hap p en ed there. It do esn ’t seem that the Maya were o verwhelmed by in vaders o r had a devastatin g in tern al civil war. It lo o ks as tho ugh there had been a huge p o p ulatio n , esp ecially livin g aro un d Tikal, an d that sudden ly in the sp ace o f a hun dred years, aro un d 9 0 0 AD, their civilizatio n co llap sed an d the p eo p le disap p eared. There’s n o eviden ce that they migrated, because there’s n o co rresp o n din g eviden ce o f in creased p o p ulatio n s in so me surro un din g area. It lo o ks as if they simp ly van ished. On e in triguin g hyp o thesis suggested that sudden climate chan ge might have been to blame. Scien tists lo o ked at ice co res fro m Green lan d co rresp o n din g to the p erio d aro un d 9 0 0 AD an d disco vered that that cen tury had been extremely co ld, far co lder than usual. The scien tists used co mp uter simulatio n s to lo o k at what the glo bal climate wo uld likely have been un der tho se co n ditio n s o f extreme co ld in the n o rthern latitudes. Dro ught in Cen tral America was o n e p redicted o utco me. It turn s o ut that o n e o f the symbo ls that co mes up a lo t in Maya in scrip tio n s at this time o f co llap se is the symbo l fo r dro ught. Co re samp les o f deep layers o f mud fro m lakes in Mexico co n firmed that a severe dro ught had in deed o ccurred at that time. When we co me to the desert So uthwest, we fin d a lo t o f eviden ce o f civilizatio n s there that became q uite so p histicated in the use o f irrigatio n . They dug can als, made ho ldin g p o n ds, an d so o n . But there to o , several civilizatio n s simp ly van ished, leavin g behin d imp ressive buildin gs such as the Mesa Verde co mp lex. So methin g hap p en ed. The Ho p i an d the o ther p ueblo s in deed have sto ries that say so methin g awful hap p en ed that caused their an cien t an cesto rs to go back in to the earth an d emerge later in a differen t wo rld. In So uth America, in Bo livia an d Peru, agriculture fo un d its way in to the mo st extreme en viro n men ts in which human s ever grew p lan ts. Fo r so me reaso n , tho se p eo p le grew fo o d higher up the mo un tain s, further in to the desert, an d deep er in to the rain fo rests than an y o ther human p o p ulatio n s ever had. No t o n ly that, but they disco vered, cultivated, tran sfo rmed, an d chan ged mo re sp ecies o f p lan ts in to cultivars [fo o d cro p s] than an y o ther co mp lex o f cultures in the histo ry o f the wo rld. Tho se An dean cultures created mo re than three tho usan d varieties o f cultivated p lan ts. That is an almo st min d-bo gglin g achievemen t. These agricultural in n o vato rs did amazin g research an d develo p men t. They to o k a n umber o f p lan ts an d adap ted them so that they co uld gro w higher an d higher up in the mo un tain s in drier an d co lder co n ditio n s. In can so ciety o rgan ized itself to be able to gro w fo o d in very differen t eco systems un der very differen t co n ditio n s to make sure that in the years when fo o d sup p lies failed in o n e p lace, it wo uld gro w in an o ther. They un dersto o d that recip ro city was a survival strategy, an d they carried o n this p ractice fo r cen turies. In fact, they were gro win g mo re an d better fo o d in the An des at that time than they are n o w. Startin g aro un d abo ut the fo urth cen tury AD, it seems that the area we n o w call Cen tral Asia—tho se huge step p es then p o p ulated mo stly by n o madic herdin g cultures—also suffered severe climate chan ges, in cludin g dro ughts an d extreme co ld weather. These climate chan ges began to cause so me tribes o f herdsmen to mo ve en masse, even tually p ushin g so me gro up s to sweep do wn fro m Cen tral Asia in to Euro p e. These massive p o p ulatio n mo vemen ts an d in vasio n s ultimately p ushed the tribes livin g n o rth o f the Ro man Emp ire ( Go ths, Visigo ths, an d Van dals) in to Italy to to p p le Ro me. There were o ther facto rs in the declin e an d fall o f Ro me, but this climate chan ge mo st likely p layed a crucial ro le. These p ast ep iso des may o ffer us clues abo ut the future o f o ur civilizatio n . They sho w us, at the very least, that civilizatio n s can be very fragile in the face o f climate chan ge. Later, in the late Middle Ages an d beyo n d, an o vercro wded, filthy, an d highly un san itary Euro p e was havin g to co n ten d co n stan tly with the “Fo ur Ho rsemen o f the Ap o calyp se”—disease, war, famin e, an d death—while in America the p ro blems were differen t. The climate kep t chan gin g an d civilizatio n s were co llap sin g. But the In dian s were learn in g ho w to co p e with it, disco verin g ho w to p lan t p lan ts that survived thro ugh dro ughts an d co ld weather. They were creatin g a versio n o f what so me p eo p le to day call “p ermaculture,” but a p ermaculture fo r the ages that un dersto o d that climate wo uldn ’t n ecessarily remain stable. That’s why I say the stup idest thin g the co lo n ists an d their go vern men ts ever did was to sup p ress In dian culture, because guess what? Climate chan ge is co min g again , an d tho se cultures had a lo t o f very p ractical kn o wledge abo ut ho w to adjust an d survive in the face o f majo r climate chan ge. I believe that what is co min g will p o se a majo r challen ge to wo rld civilizatio n . A high-tech civilizatio n that dep en ds o n run n in g water, electricity, bridges, an d so o n is far mo re fragile than we realize. I thin k the Ho p i were right: Western civilizatio n will face the same kin d o f challen ges the an cien t civilizatio n s o f this co n tin en t faced, but we’re n o t ready to deal with them. The Ho p i had so me imp o rtan t messages fo r us, but, so far, we’re n o t listen in g. This p resen tatio n to o k p lace at the Bio n eers Co n feren ce in 2 0 0 4 .

So in my way, to discuss these co n cep ts, I wan t to o ffer a so n g to brin g o ur min ds an d hearts to gether. All human s have two thin gs in co mmo n : We walk o n two legs an d o n each han d we have these five fin gers an d esp ecially these thumbs.

An d o f co urse, the use o f this thumb p lays a key ro le in ho w we use o ur min ds an d han ds to build thin gs . . . o r to tear thin gs ap art. In my D in e’ ( Navajo ) teachin gs, we call o urselves the Five Fin gers Clan —which is the human p eo p le. As two -legged creatures we also have been p ro vided with o ur min ds.

We are p eo p le o f the lan d, we are p eo p le o f the waters an d the lakes, we are the river p eo p le, we are the desert p eo p le, we are the p lateau p eo p le, we are the mo un tain p eo p le, an d we are the p eo p le fro m the fo rests, we are also the Pacific Islan ders. Fro m the fo ur directio n s o f this wo rld we are still here desp ite great o bstacles that have challen ged o ur survival. That is why I’m so grateful to the Creato r to be able to be here an d, as we say back ho me, to live with my relatio n s o n e mo re day. Back in Min n eso ta o ur wo rld is chan gin g right n o w, we are in a fo ur- seaso n wo rld. An d at this p lace in Min n eso ta, that is the cen ter o f o ur un iverse, all o f life is p rep arin g fo r win ter when o ur Mo ther Earth is go in g to be restin g, p rep arin g herself to sleep , to be co vered with a blan ket o f sn o w that will keep her warm an d create the q uietn ess that she will n eed to rest fro m a lo n g year that starts fo r her in sp rin g, an d co n tin ues thro ugho ut the summer an d fall.

Ho w man y o f yo u have ever taken the time to slo w do wn to see that there are so me thin gs un seen —a sp irit fo rce, as in this examp le—guidin g this in dividual leaf, allo win g it to take that jo urn ey, flo atin g, bein g carried by a breeze o f win d, an d sudden ly whip p ed up to fly up in to the air again ?

Our Mo ther Earth an d o ur p lan t an d an imal relatives are resp ected so vereign liberated bein gs with rights o f their o wn . Who will defen d tho se that can n o t sp eak? The Euro p ean co n cep t o f the n atural wo rld, which has beco me a do min an t co n cep t wo rldwide, views kn o wledge an d culture as p ro p erty, with the attitude that co mmo dities are to be exp lo ited freely an d bo ught an d so ld at will. This has resulted in disharmo n y between human bein gs an d the n atural wo rld, as well as the curren t en viro n men tal crisis threaten in g all life. This co n cep t is to tally in co mp atible with the traditio n al In digen o us wo rldview. In digen o us Peo p les were given , by o ur Creato r, the resp o n sibility to p ro tect lan d an d n atural life up o n which o ur survival dep en ds. Our sacred resp o n sibility is to safeguard an d p ro tect this wo rld. Human bein gs are n o t sep arate fro m the rest o f the n atural wo rld but were created to live in an in tegral relatio n ship with it; that’s what we have to o ffer. Un derstan din g these In digen o us p rin cip les p ro vides un derstan din g o f lo ve—lo ve fo r Mo ther Earth an d Father Sky.

As human bein gs we are all related to each o ther, we are the five-fin gered clan . We are the five-fin gered clan o f human bein gs.

But they are all co n n ected to each o ther an d have to learn to help each o ther. Let us learn to wo rk to gether as p eo p le o f man y co lo rs, man y cultures, all gen ders; we do n ’t have much time. There is an Australian Abo rigin e bush sayin g that states: “If yo u stay clo sely un ited, yo u are like a tree stan din g in the middle o f a bush-fire sweep in g thro ugh the timber; the leaves are sco rched, the to ugh bark is scarred an d burn ed, but in side the tree the sap still flo ws an d un der the gro un d the ro o ts are still stro n g.

This p resen tatio n to o k p lace at the Bio n eers Co n feren ce in 2 0 0 1 . 2 5 Return o f the An cien t Co un cil Ways: In digen o us Survival in Chiap as Ohki Simin é Fo r es t When I arrived in Chiap as in 1 9 8 6 it was just befo re a p lan etary co n figuratio n o f great sign ifican ce to the an cien t Maya. In my first year in Chiap as, it became clear to me that altho ugh n o bo dy was talkin g abo ut it, a revo lutio n was go in g to hap p en because the o p p ressio n an d racism to ward the In digen o us Maya was terrible. In Chiap as, yo u truly feel yo u’re back in co lo n ial times. It felt to me there was n o o ther cho ice fo r the p eo p le there than to create a revo lutio n to liberate themselves fro m the devastatin g effect o f the Sp an ish co n q uest an d the ap p allin g abuses o f the Mexican go vern men t. Seven years later, o n Jan uary 1 , 1 9 9 4 , I was abo ut to give birth to my daughter. We awo ke to an up risin g in several to wn s, in cludin g San Cristóbal de las Casas where I was livin g. I had almo st fo rgo tten abo ut my p redicted revo lutio n ; everyo n e was taken by surp rise. This tran scen den t even t sho o k everyo n e, as if a huge earthq uake had hap p en ed. Fo r me, it was as if a n ew era had fin ally dawn ed. Then o n TV an d the radio , the wo rld learn ed who the Zap atistas were an d abo ut their tremen do us sufferin g as In digen o us Maya. The wo rld’s eyes were sudden ly o n Chiap as, a p lace co n sidered to be, o n ly a few sho rt min utes befo re, a p aradise o n earth. Man y p eo p le left, an d a n ew cro wd o f p eo p le arrived: jo urn alists, activists, co n scio us p eo p le, an d sp ies. Chiap as was n o t o n the map p rio r to this. If I to ld p eo p le I lived in Chiap as, very few kn ew where it was. Befo re this up risin g—o n e o f the mo st up liftin g the wo rld has seen —the Maya p eo p le o f Chiap as had been fo rgo tten an d aban do n ed. We o n ly kn ew them because o f their in credible an cien t ruin s an d p ast sp len do rs. Yet the livin g Maya were an illiterate, margin aliz ed, an d extremely p o o r p eo p le. We learn ed these p eo p le also had dign ity, tremen do us visio n , an d an cien t wisdo m. An d tho ugh they had taken up arms, they are very p eaceful by n ature. In the en d, the Chiap as revo lutio n shed almo st n o blo o d. They had so methin g o f great sign ifican ce to say to the wo rld. They were makin g a stan d again st chan ges to Article 2 7 in the Mexican Co n stitutio n , which had guaran teed sin ce the 1 9 1 0 revo lutio n that the lan d belo n ged to tho se who wo rked it. With the chan ges, this co mmun al ejido system was beco min g p rivate p ro p erty. This was a big blo w to the In digen o us co mmun al laws everywhere in Mexico . The Zap atistas also made a stan d again st the NAFTA treaties between Can ada, the Un ited States, an d Mexico , which were go in g in to effect that same first day o f Jan uary. They were the o n ly p eo p le in No rth America to risk their lives o p p o sin g this aggressio n again st In digen o us Peo p les an d their way o f life. We also learn ed the Zap atistas were n o t a ban d o f armed dreamers re- creatin g the Che visio n , but actually millio n s o f p eo p le o rgan iz ed with their o wn legitimate army based o n the Gen eva treaties; they had fo rmed in a very co heren t way to p ro tect themselves again st go vern men t abuses. Fo r tho se o f us with kn o wledge abo ut an cien t Maya p ro p hecies, the Zap atista up risin g is also the p redicted return o f the Plumed Serp en t. He was a high p riest who created the advan ced Maya civiliz atio n . Yet the Plumed Serp en t was defeated by an o ther p riest n amed Smo kin g Obsidian Mirro r fro m Ten o chtitlan ( n o w Mexico City) an d fo rced to aban do n his beautiful reign . He left as the Mo rn in g Star, sayin g that he wo uld return after a p lan etary co n vergen ce in 1 9 8 7 to brin g back his go vern an ce in the Maya lan d. He wo uld return as a high co n scio usn ess an d take the fo rm o f a tran scen din g serp en t risin g fro m deep within the earth, first in Palen q ue, Chiap as—the third eye o f the Americas—an d then in the wo rld. As he rises fro m un der the earth, he will shake fro m belo w everythin g an d everyo n e alo n g his p athway. He will shake all o f the o ld p atriarchal p aradigms by brin gin g the p eo p le true ways o f ho w to go vern themselves an d take back their freedo m fro m the terro r an d co rrup tio n o f Smo kin g Mirro r. That first day o f Jan uary, I was sudden ly makin g all these lin ks in my min d. A few years befo re, a Mo hawk chief in Can ada shared an an cien t p ro p hecy with me: When the termin atio n o f In dian s is o ver, the Iro q uo is fo rm o f go vern men t, which survived the co n q uest in tact, will return to all the Americas. An d then , ap p aren tly o ut o f the blue, millio n s o f p eo p le who had been en slaved by the Sp an iards, then terribly exp lo ited by the Mexican go vern men t, will sudden ly o rgan iz e themselves with the an cien t kn o wledge, recalled in their blo o d, o f In dian co un cil ways, an d they will arise to claim their auto n o my. The Zap atista way o f o rgan iz in g is very similar to what I have o bserved in the an cien t co un cil ways o f the Iro q uo is League o f Peace. Co un cil ways are the fo rm o f go vern men t fo r the n ew times, the p o sttermin atio n times, which we ho p e is n o w. The an cien t co un cil ways are based o n Medicin e Wheel ways. This mean s there’s a ho riz o n tal axis co mp o sed o f the eight cardin al directio n s. An d the n in th o n e at the cen ter is the vertical axis that lin ks with the sky. Co un cil ways are a smaller versio n o f the great wheel o f the un iverse, which gives us a n atural fo rm o f p erso n al an d co llective go vern an ce. Natives in No rth America lived acco rdin g to the co un cil ways fo r q uite so me time, in huge bro therho o ds an d sisterho o ds. There were co un cils fo r every asp ect o f life—p eace co un cils, war co un cils, sp iritual, p o litical, eco n o mic co un cils, an d medicin e co un cils. On e o f the main characteristics o f the co un cil ways is its in clusiven ess. All is in cluded, even the “bad”— everythin g has its p lace in the larger wheel. What makes a co un cil a true co un cil is its system o f demo cracy an d co llectiven ess at the same time. To achieve this, the p eo p le must p articip ate an d always be co n sulted in the decisio n -makin g p ro cess. It’s the mo st resilien t an d fair fo rm o f go vern men t that exists, fo r it teaches p eo p le to p reserve their auto n o my an d reso urces, to go vern themselves, an d to cho o se their destin y. It help s them gro w resp o n sible an d co n scio us in p ro mo tin g an d p ro tectin g all fo rms o f life. A co un cil, bein g a circle, is un breakable. There is n o thin g mo re p o werful than a circle. The system o f In dian reservatio n s was created o n ly because o ur tribal circles co uld n o t be bro ken . It was easier to draw sq uares o n the U.S. map aro un d the tribes. Yet they co uld n o t break o ur sp irit, as we’ve sho wn in 5 1 3 years o f resistan ce. We have always been in resistan ce again st glo baliz atio n . Our chiefs had fo reseen this co min g. In this same way, the Chiap as resistan ce is a mo st sin gular o n e fo r it has a glo bal imp act. It’s n o t a resistan ce fo r an ethn ic gro up , an ideo lo gy, o r a class war. It’s n o t a resistan ce so lely fo r their o wn rights to live. It’s a revo lutio n that o p en ed do o rs, n o t o n ly to all the In digen o us Peo p les o f Mexico , but to the who le o f Mexican so ciety: mestiz o p eo p le, n o n -In dian p eo p le, even to the an ti-Zap atistas. Ho wever, it was also n o t limited just to the Mexican so ciety but is o p en to an y o n e o f yo u who wish to jo in with yo ur heart an d co n scio usn ess in this glo bal resistan ce, this huge return o f co un cil ways. In 1 9 9 4 , the Zap atistas sto p p ed their war because the civil so ciety ro se an d deman ded p eace. They sign ed a cease-fire agreemen t, which the Mexican go vern men t has n o t kep t. The Zap atistas said they sign ed that agreemen t at the time because they heard the drums o f the civil so ciety, the heartbeat o f the co mmo n p eo p le. What Marco s ( the main sp o kesp erso n o f the Zap atistas) has do n e is un p receden ted. He made co mp rehen sible fo r the co mmo n p eo p le, the terrible imp acts o f n eo liberalism an d glo baliz atio n in the first an d third wo rlds. Befo re that it was just in tellectual talk. If the p eo p le ro se in arms—an d mo st o f them had o n ly wo o den sticks to defen d themselves—it was because there were n o o ther o p tio n s. They had tried, by all mean s, to be heard. They always said they had weap o n s that asp ire to be useless. Their cry, “Ya Ba s ta ! ( That’s en o ugh) ,” was their claim, fo r themselves an d their children , fo r decen t lives, fo o d, health care, an d educatio n . The Zap atistas have also raised co n scio usn ess amo n g their p eo p le abo ut ho w to p o werfully affect a clear lin e o f resistan ce by takin g p ractical actio n s. Fo r examp le, they do n o t accep t an ythin g fro m their go vern men t, a go vern men t who se tactics are to buy the p eo p le with crumbs. Their resistan ce in this regard has made it clear to all that Zap atista dign ity is n o t fo r sale. The Zap atista p eo p le have said NO to alco ho l, drugs, defo restatio n , an d the p lun derin g o f reso urces, NO to the abuses o f the go vern men t an d their in terest in the o il in the so il. This NO led them to declare their territo ries liberated an d auto n o mo us in 1 9 9 4 , a liberatio n fro m five hun dred years o f an un just co urse in their destin y. When yo u en ter an auto n o mo us co mmun ity ( this, iro n ically after yo u p ass a federal army p o st) yo u’re greeted by a large sign sayin g that here the p eo p le co n tro l their o wn lan d an d reso urces. To do this mo re effectively they have fo rmed the Go o d Go vern men t o f the Peo p le, La Jun ta de Buen Go b ier n o , in o p p o sitio n to the bad go vern men t o f the fin an cial p o wers. In the auto n o mo us co mmun ities they say the Go o d Go vern men ts listen to everyo n e who visits. Their go vern men t is situated in what is called the Ca r a co les , which mean s shells o r sn ails. These are their five cen tral meetin g p laces fo r co mmun ity rep resen tatives. The seashell was the traditio n al in strumen t blo wn by the an cien t Maya to in vo ke their deities an d to co n ven e the p eo p le to their ceremo n ies. The Caraco les are a sp eaker to the wo rld, to be heard an d to hear everyo n e who co mes to learn abo ut the resistan ce an d exchan ge their wo rds. This un iq ue co mmun icatio n metho d is an un dergro un d way o f tran smittin g in fo rmatio n . Like the Caraco les, this metho d wo rks fo r tho se who walk clo se to the gro un d an d it leaves a clear p ath fo r all to fo llo w. When yo u meet with the Zap atista men an d wo men in o n e o f their rustic buildin gs at their Caraco l, they lo o k at yo u thro ugh their black ski masks an d yo u see an an cien t wisdo m in their eyes. The ski mask n o t o n ly p ro tects their iden tities but is a p o werful symbo l o f ho w they were n ever heard desp ite their lo n g an d n umero us effo rts. The mask also says, “We wo uld rather stay hidden fo r we do n o t wan t the p o wer. This is a resistan ce o f truths an d actio n s.” But in the en d, thro ugh their masks, they see a great deal an d are n o fo o ls. In meetin g with them, there is a lo n g silen ce befo re talkin g, a resp ectful an d a kin d o n e. Then , o n e o f the ski masks greets yo u in a vo ice that seems to have suffered fo r etern ity yet is n o t co mp lain in g, but is warm an d clear; that o f an un armed civil co mman der. The vo ice starts exp lain in g ( to me) that everythin g here is decided by the p eo p le thro ugh referen dum an d it’s o ften a lo n g p ro cess. Startin g at twelve years o f age, everyo n e is co n sulted in makin g decisio n s. Fo r eleven years the resistan ce has gro wn a great deal, but n o t witho ut en o rmo us sacrifices; they have created p ro grams fo r auto n o mo us educatio n based o n p reservin g the en viro n men t, as well as their an cien t culture. They also have created their o wn health p ro grams, train ed hun dreds o f yo un g men an d wo men as health p ro mo ters all o ver Chiap as, an d built auto n o mo us clin ics in man y differen t areas. As I hear this sho rt, In digen o us man talkin g in a slo w, deliberate fashio n , I can n o t sto p thin kin g abo ut the deep ly in tern aliz ed o p p ressio n the Maya carry. It’s a men tality that is hard to break thro ugh, yet the ability to break free is so methin g the Zap atista resistan ce has given the p eo p le. To achieve this, the n ative Maya kicked a huge ho le in the glo baliz atio n p aradigms. An d in this, they were the first o n es to sp eak o f glo baliz in g resistan ce, fo r the sake o f everyo n e, fo r the sake o f o ur children . The Chiap as resistan ce is also a sp iritual revo lutio n . Fo r the Maya p eo p le, the disco n n ectio n fro m their o wn sp irituality was very drastic un der the Sp an ish Co n q uest. While n o rthern Natives were margin aliz ed in iso lated reservatio n s, man y o f o ur fo refathers an d fo remo thers did everythin g to keep in tact the sacred lin k to o ur sp iritual ways fro m befo re the co n q uest. In Chiap as, ho wever, this lin k was destro yed by the Sp an iards to such an exten t that mo st o f the In digen o us Peo p les did n o t even kn o w there had been a co n q uest an d had lo st to uch with their sp iritual traditio n s. Ho wever, o n e o f the thin gs the Zap atistas bro ught to the p eo p le, esp ecially Marco s in his co mmun iq ué s, is a reawaken in g o f awaren ess o f the an cien t Maya sp irituality an d its deities. I brin g my atten tio n back to the meetin g when I hear the co mman der tellin g me that, in their un derstan din g, they are n o t do in g this huge sacrifice o n ly fo r their p eo p le but fo r everyo n e. Pa r a to do s , to do , p a r a n o s o tr o s n a da . All fo r everyo n e, n o thin g fo r us. It is a sacrifice, fo r in their wo rk as rep resen tatives they have to leave their families fo r man y weeks, durin g which time they o n ly have a few hard to rtillas to eat. The rep resen tatives sleep o n the hard flo o r o f their meetin g ro o ms—it’s a very difficult life to be a Zap atista in this sen se, he co n tin ues exp lain in g. So metimes they have n o mo n ey fo r buses to go fro m o n e p lace to an o ther an d so metimes they do n ’t sleep fo r days an d n ights. Also they risk their lives a great deal. A Zap atista life req uires a lo t o f en duran ce an d determin atio n . So metimes they get ill fo r lack o f decen t fo o d, he says, but they keep go in g. They can n o t give up , fo r the sake o f their p eo p le an d all human ity. The man co n tin ues, “As Zap atistas, we have been declared terro rists fo r simp ly wan tin g to live, fo r askin g fo r fo o d, fo r health care, fo r educatio n . But fo r us, in the eyes o f the true man an d true wo man , terro rism is greed, racism, hate, an d war. Fo r true chan ge, we are ready to die with dign ity, in resistan ce, in stead o f waitin g to die fro m curable diseases an d hun ger.” The meetin g en ds after a few ho urs an d the men an d wo men co mman ders tell me, very humbly, “Muchis ima s gr a cia s fo r yo ur great sacrifice o f co min g to meet with us an d givin g a do n atio n to help us run o ur clin ics.” I lo o k at them, asto n ished. I rep ly, n o t witho ut difficulty in ho ldin g back my tears, “I’m n o t do in g an ythin g here! Yo u’re do in g everythin g fo r all o f us, brin gin g a light o f ho p e to human ity that this is p o ssible, that millio n s o f p eo p le can o rgan iz e at the same time to create this huge mo vemen t so the right values can return to o ur wo un ded human ity. Yo u all talk to us abo ut bein g ver da der o ho mb r e, ver da der a mujer , the true man an d the true wo man . We have the same exp ressio n amo n g the Mo hawk p eo p le, On gwhe On whe, which mean s the True Peo p le. It’s very an cien t to Native p eo p le to be true human s, true warrio rs o f life, to fight fo r what we kn o w is right an d fo r the tran sfo rmatio n o f all darkn ess.” I leave “the shell” flo o ded with in sp iratio n . Yes, n o do ubt, the Chiap as resistan ce is a n ew kin d o f revo lutio n . In meetin g with them I’m o verwhelmed by their amaz in g humility an d p atien ce. It’s heartbreakin g, the absen ce o f ego yo u see in these p eo p le. They’re just right there, smilin g at yo u un der their mask, thro ugh their eyes as bright as stars. Marco s said, “There are n o recip es, n o ideo lo gies, n o tactics, n o laws, n o regulatio n s, n o slo gan s—Zap atismo is but a bridge . . . a rain bo w bridge amo n g us all. . . .” The Zap atistas have n o p lan ; they walk o n e step at a time an d wait to see where the n ext step is go in g to lead them, fo r they walk with the will an d heart o f the p eo p le, an d with the dream o f the earth. An d they are shakin g the wo rld fro m un dern eath, just as the Plumed Serp en t p ro mised. It’s a n ew kin d o f resistan ce. Their message calls us to dream with the earth an d to hear her dream within us. The Chiap as resistan ce o ffers a p lace beyo n d the o p p ressio n these p eo p le have lived with fo r so lo n g, o n e that mirro rs all the o p p ressio n s we all have within . They are the n ew warrio rs. I can go back ho me n o w with a ren ewed sen se o f ho p e. True chan ges are p o ssible an d it will co me fro m un der the earth like the Maya who sleep o n her flesh. The an cien t Maya p ro p hesiz ed that there will co me a time, after a p lan etary co n vergen ce in 1 9 8 7 , when the dark times will be o ver, the humble will win o ver the arro gan t. It’s hap p en in g, un dergro un d, with the simp le p eo p le. They barely kn o w ho w to sp eak Sp an ish to defen d themselves in the do min an t culture. Yet in their n o n vio len t ways o f exp ressin g their in tegrity, they are n o w allied with hun dreds o f o rgan iz atio n s an d millio n s o f p eo p le all o ver the wo rld. They shin e a light o f in tegrity, while we let o urselves be co n tamin ated by co n sumerist so cieties with the wro n g values such as co mp etitio n , ambitio n , arro gan ce, an d o ffen sive actio n s such as p o llutin g o ur sacred Mo ther. The Zap atistas have o p en ed the p o ssibility fo r the Maya p eo p le to break thro ugh their in tern aliz ed o p p ressio n , tran sfo rmin g their fear o f p un ishmen t. This revo lutio n is abo ut tran sfo rmin g o ur fears o f lethargy, autho rity, an d terro r—the same fears that have created this destructive glo bal emp ire. This small yet great p eo p le are teachin g us to n o t be afraid to stan d tall in o ur o wn truth. It’s a deep tran sfo rmatio n they are askin g all o f us to achieve in resistin g o blivio n to gether. What I’ve learn ed fro m my Zap atista co mp a ñer o s is that the seed o f all true p o wer is within us. We will all die o n e day, but dign ity can n ever die because dign ity is the sp irit o f earth within us. If human ity can learn to see thro ugh In digen o us eyes, an d to hear in the lan d the vo ices o f o ur n ative an cesto rs—which co n tin ue to sp eak to us o f dign ity—then the hearts o f all p eo p le will be healed. We are all bein g called to go thro ugh this lesso n in co urage to en ter in to the n ew times in 2 0 1 3 p ro p hesiz ed by the Maya. Fo r techn o lo gy has bro ught a lo t o f co mmo dities, mo re securities, mo re scien tific kn o wledge, but life ap p ears to have less an d less mean in g fo r human ity. Never befo re has human ity been so emp ty an d bo red, o r made so man y effo rts to desp erately acq uire mo re. This desp erate grasp in g is an d has always been the o n ly real cause o f human ity’s sufferin g an d the imbalan ces o f this earth. It creates aggressio n an d p o verty, in stead o f the o p en gen ero sity o f o ur n atural selves. Fo r the wo rst to xin s are n o t tho se o f extern al p o llutio n but tho se gen erated by human ity’s wro n g thin kin g. The Maya have bro ught to human ity a great awaken in g. Po ssessin g n o thin g, greatly sufferin g fro m the n egative imp acts o f glo baliz atio n , they brin g the lesso n s we mo st n eed. They strive to create true fo rms o f o rgan iz atio n based o n the Co un cil ways an d they gen ero usly share this mo del with us. We can o n ly jo in o ur hearts with them in ho p in g we can also recreate, wherever we are, the un dergro un d resistan ce that n eeds to hap p en in a massive way. This will hap p en thro ugh gratitude, resp ect fo r n ature, an d co o p eratin g as much as we can with the fo rces o f life, with the like-min ded p eo p le aro un d us. We can n o t fight directly the p o wers o f glo baliz atio n that are killin g us all. We can o n ly strive to brin g back the dream o f the earth, her co un cil ways, ho wever we can . Demo cracy an d true co mmun ity mean that all o f us n o t o n ly sp eak but also take actio n to create a light o f ho p e fo r o ur children —“the Co min g Faces,” as the Iro q uo is call them. Marco s wro te in 1 9 9 3 befo re the up risin g, “No w it’s time to wake up . . . . Fro m the clash o f the two win ds, the sto rm will be bo rn , its time has arrived, the fire o f histo ry is aro used.

When the sto rm calms, when the rain an d fire again leave the earth in p eace, the wo rld will n o lo n ger be the wo rld, but so methin g better.” I was exp lain in g recen tly to my daughter that we’re all co n n ected an d an ythin g she do es can affect so meo n e else in the wo rld. She to ld me she did n o t believe me, that she had just p ut her feet in the p o n d by o ur ho me an d it did n o t affect me, so ho w co uld it affect a Chin ese p erso n aro un d the glo be? I exp lain ed, “Yo u’re n o t un derstan din g this p rin cip le co rrectly. When yo u p ut yo ur feet in the p o n d, because yo u lo ve water so much, that makes yo u very hap p y. An d here, as I am wo rkin g o n my p resen tatio n fo r the Bio n eers Co n feren ce, feelin g a bit stuck, yo ur hap p in ess in sp ires me; it help s me write fro m my heart.

Later, I heard my daughter talkin g with a yo un g Maya Zap atista wo man while they were wo rkin g “Do n ’t dro p the bro o m carelessly like that, yo u can really affect a lo t o f p eo p le! ” Yes, we all can affect, in dividually, a lo t o f p eo p le. The extermin atio n o f the Maya, a very real an d p resen t threat, wo uld be the en d o f o ur ho p e fo r castin g o ff the glo bal imp erialism killin g us all.

IEN has been aro un d here in Turtle Islan d, what we call No rth America, fo r abo ut fifteen years. Our so le reaso n fo r existen ce is to meet the o utcry co min g fro m o ver five hun dred n atio n s that call Turtle Islan d ho me in terms o f the in justices that have been imp o sed o n o ur p eo p le. In digen o us Peo p les are disp ro p o rtio n ately imp acted an d burden ed by un sustain able develo p men t an d to xic co n tamin atio n . IEN was created because in America an d in Can ada, tran sn atio n al o il co mp an ies an d co rp o ratio n s that create to xic in cin erato rs an d waste dump s target o ur co mmun ities as sites to p lace ho rrible chemicals un dern eath o r n ext to o ur children ’s ho mes an d scho o ls. IEN has been wo rkin g to p ro tect the sacredn ess o f Mo ther Earth fro m this to xic co n tamin atio n fo r a little bit o ver a decade n o w. This has bro ught us to man y differen t realms, fro m do wn o n the Res*1 2 to ban d halls to reservatio n scho o l gyms do in g wo rksho p s, co mmun ity educatio n p ieces, to try to help p eo p le un derstan d the dan gers o f these huge co rp o rate mo n sters that co me in to o ur co mmun ities, p ro misin g a better way o f life thro ugh the in dustrializatio n game. Glo bally there are 3 5 0 millio n In digen o us Peo p les reco gn ized by the Un ited Natio n s. I wo uld go as far as to say that there are 6 0 0 millio n , but I’ll go with what the statistics say. Tho se 3 5 0 millio n In digen o us Peo p les rep resen t 8 6 p ercen t o f the wo rld’s cultural diversity. In o ther wo rds, 8 6 p ercen t o f all the lan guages sp o ken o n Mo ther Earth are sp o ken by that very small n umber that I just men tio n ed. No w, tho se 3 5 0 millio n In digen o us Peo p les acro ss Mo ther Earth are cradled in 8 7 p ercen t o f the wo rld’s last remain in g p ristin e eco systems, p laces where the circle o f life is still stro n g, where yo u can still harvest medicin es, where yo u can still hun t an d fish witho ut gettin g sick, where yo u can still drin k fro m the river o r the lake. These are o ur fin al stan d p laces, an d they are o ur sacred p laces—the Arctic Natio n al Wildlife Refuge, p laces like the p ro tected areas in the Ro cky Mo un tain s, beautiful p laces like the Everglades in Flo rida—sacred p laces where life an d medicin e are abun dan t. We are a n etwo rk co mp rised o f 2 5 0 n ative co mmun ities an d o rgan izatio n s sp read o ut acro ss Turtle Islan d. IEN has been reachin g o ut to n ative gro up s. We all have this un derstan din g o f the sacredn ess that we carry as In digen o us Peo p les, the resp o n sibility to p ro tect the sacred. The fact is that 3 5 0 millio n p eo p le rep resen tin g 8 6 p ercen t o f all the lan guages live o n so me o f the last p laces left o n the earth that are still healthy an d we call these p laces “ho me.” Our struggle is everybo dy’s struggle, an d this is what IEN has been tryin g to brin g o ut. Eco n o mic glo balizatio n , an d its n o tio n that we can have etern ally exp an din g markets based up o n co n sump tio n o f fin ite reso urces, is p sycho tic. This p ro cess is imp actin g all o f o ur n atio n s wo rldwide, an d we— o ur cultures, o ur lan guages—face extin ctio n . By 2 0 5 0 , in Can ada, which I call ho me, o n ly three o f o ur In digen o us lan guages will have survived. So diversity lo ss is critical. I wan t to discuss the diversity o f issues that we wo rk with at IEN, but sp ecifically I wan t to discuss the p etro leum in dustry, which is what I fo cus my wo rk o n . Basically, p eo p le refuse to un derstan d o r accep t the fact that there are man y p ro blems that we face to day, fo r examp le, climate chan ge. Man y p eo p le, esp ecially fo lks livin g in urban cen ters o r p laces where they are in sulated fro m the true imp act o f what’s hap p en in g right n o w, o n the gro un d in o ur n ative territo ries acro ss Turtle Islan d an d wo rldwide, are n o t burden ed with the same imp act. When chemical co mp an ies make to xic chemicals, p ersisten t o rgan ic p o llutan ts, DDT, differen t chemicals like that, p eo p le do n ’t realize that these chemicals travel tho usan ds o f miles because o f the n ature o f their co mp o sitio n . They travel tho usan ds o f miles thro ugh the air curren ts o f Mo ther Earth, up to the Arctic an d to the so uthern regio n s o f the p lan et, an d that’s why man y o f o ur p eo p le that live up in the Arctic have ten times the n o rmal PCP an d dio xin levels in their breast milk. Our mo thers are, o f co urse, then feedin g that to o ur children . Eco n o mic glo balizatio n to day has p ut p ro fit befo re life—p ro fit befo re life. An d to take that statemen t even further, eco n o mic glo balizatio n is co mmo difyin g the very life that makes up Mo ther Earth—creatio n . On e o f the thin gs that IEN tries to do is to brin g awaren ess o f the wo rld an d o f the co smic views that In digen o us Peo p les have, an d we fight again st the co mmo dificatio n o f what is sacred, which in cludes o ur human gen es, the gen es o f p lan ts, o ur water—an d so o n an d so fo rth. We fight again st the exp lo itatio n o f tho se that can n o t sp eak fo r themselves. Our wo rk is very vast an d we wo rk o n man y camp aign s in o ur o rgan izatio n ; we have a water camp aign , a min in g camp aign , an d a p ersisten t o rgan ic p o llutan ts camp aign .

An d so , co rp o ratio n s co me to o ur co mmun ities with p ro mises o f a better life, so lutio n s to the in credible p ro blems that we face, tryin g to seduce us in to the bo o m-bust game o f big develo p men t. They target o ur co mmun ities, kn o win g that o ur co mmun ities are suscep tible to sayin g yes to these harmful en ergy p ro jects because o f the big p ayo ffs that co me with them. The wo rk that I do is to try to p ull to gether regio n al n etwo rks acro ss Turtle Islan d, in Alaska, in Alberta, Can ada, in the Mo n tan a-Wyo min g regio n , in the So uthwest, an d in Oklaho ma. I’ve been o rgan izin g o ur tribes, tryin g to p ro vide them with p o p ular educatio n materials so that they can un derstan d that this en ergy co lo n izatio n that is hap p en in g o n o ur lan ds is so methin g we sho uld n o t have an y p art o f. It is n eo co lo n ialism. What I co mmo n ly tell p eo p le is that where I’m fro m, years ago , we had Jesuit p riests in black ro bes co min g in to o ur co mmun ities an d p ro misin g a better way o f life thro ugh chan gin g the way we co mmun icate with Creato r. Of co urse, at that time, there was an in credible marriage between church an d state. To day, the reality that In digen o us Peo p les face is the n ew religio n o f the wo rld—cap italism—an d in stead o f Jesuit p riests in black ro bes co min g in to o ur co mmun ities as that arm o f the state to exp lo it us, we’ve go t co rp o rate CEOs in black suits co min g in to o ur co mmun ities, p ro misin g a better way o f life thro ugh un sustain able develo p men t p ractices. These p ractices to tally go again st what p eo p le in o ur co mmun ity o f Bio n eers refer to as the Precautio n ary Prin cip le, but what we, where I’m fro m, refer to as the Seven th Gen eratio n Pro p hesy. In o ther wo rds, the p ro p hesy is abo ut thin kin g ahead seven gen eratio n s; the actio n s that yo u have to day will imp act yo ur children ’s, children ’s, children ’s seven times o ver. We’ve been wo rkin g o n the lo cal level, what we call the fro n t lin e o f resistan ce, where o ur co mmun ities live, where o ur p eo p le live.

So methin g that p eo p le have to un derstan d is that if we co n tin ue to live beyo n d o ur eco lo gical limits in the city en viro n men t, we’re go in g to have to go so mewhere else an d get tho se reso urces. No w, whether that’s Iraq o r Navajo Natio n , it’s go in g to co n tin ue to hap p en . So what we’ve been do in g is tryin g to educate o ur p eo p le abo ut the real reality that this in dustry do es to all o f us. No t o n ly do es it co mp letely destro y o ur lan d, o ur water q uality, o ur an imals o n the lan d, an d o ur ability to go o ut o n the lan d, but because this is the mo st to xic in dustry n ext to n uclear, the chemicals an d everythin g that they use get released in to o ur en viro n men t an d to us. It is a dirty in dustry fro m begin n in g to en d—fro m takin g o il o ut o f the gro un d, to the refin in g o f that o il, to when it gets burn t up in o ur jets an d o ur cars. We try to educate o ur p eo p le abo ut what we call the River o f Destructio n . Oil in dustry typ es divide their in dustry in to three segmen ts: up stream, midstream, an d do wn stream—up stream bein g extractio n , midstream bein g the tran sp o rt an d refin in g o f that raw crude o r gas, an d do wn stream bein g where they sell it to yo u, the co n sumer. What we try to educate o ur co mmun ities abo ut is the fact that at every p o in t o f that defin itio n —up stream, midstream, do wn stream—there are disp ro p o rtio n ate imp acts. Whether it’s In digen o us Peo p les fightin g again st these co mp an ies, fro m drillin g their lan d an d destro yin g an d p o llutin g it, to co mmun ities o f co lo r that have to live beside huge o il refin eries—fo r examp le, the Richmo n d o il refin ery that yo u can see o n the way to Marin fro m Oaklan d, the ho me o f Chevro n -“To xico ”—that harm them in a terrible way. We take this wo rk fro m that level, fro m that co mmun ity grassro o ts o rgan izin g level, an d we amp lify o ur co mmun ity-activist vo ices by brin gin g them to differen t fo rums bo th n atio n ally an d in tern atio n ally. IEN acts as a go -between , a mediato r fo r a lo t o f these big, UN gatherin gs like the Co mmissio n o n Sustain able Develo p men t, the Wo rld Summit o n Sustain able Develo p men t, the Co mmissio n o n Bio diversity, an d o ther gatherin gs where they make up these glo bal, multilateral, en viro n men tal agreemen ts. We wo rk to brin g o ur p eo p le up to tho se levels so that they can p ut a face to the o p p ressio n that is hap p en in g wo rldwide as a result o f the p etro leum eco n o my, the o ff-ramp eco n o my. We try to do this wo rk with the few reso urces that we have. IEN is in a crisis mo de co n sisten tly because o f the in credible amo un t o f req uests we get fo r help acro ss No rth America. I, myself—just o n e in dividual—wo rk with thirty-six differen t tribes o n o il an d gas issues alo n e. An imp o rtan t issue that p eo p le n eed to be aware o f is the fact that there n eeds to be a co n vergen ce o f all kin ds o f p eo p le wo rkin g o n these issues. But it’s hard to achieve that because p eo p le are lackin g an un derstan din g o f the disp ro p o rtio n ate imp acts that co me with thin gs like climate chan ge. It’s easy fo r p eo p le to n ego tiate co n ditio n s an d terms with these evil co rp o ratio n s an d these go vern men ts when they do n ’t un derstan d what’s really hap p en in g. The reality is that it’s an un fair n ego tiatio n p ro cess—they get taken advan tage o f because they do n ’t un derstan d the co mp lexity o f these issues an d the full ramificatio n s o f these issues. As a result o f that, p eo p le right n o w are sufferin g directly. We’re seein g majo r chan ges in o ur en viro n men t fro m Alaska all the way do wn to the Gulf o f Mexico . Navajo Natio n is seein g in credible chan ges o ut there, to o , in their en viro n men t as a result o f climate chan ge. We n eed to un derstan d that the so lutio n s that we trump up at these in tern atio n al an d n atio n al debates are mean in gless witho ut In digen o us access. I say this fro m my heart, In digen o us Peo p les n eed access, access, access. Access to these meetin gs an d debates so that they have relevan ce an d make sen se to the p eo p le who are in vo lved. We have to co me to gether, but ho w do we do that? It’s imp o ssible to do that witho ut talkin g abo ut race, witho ut talkin g abo ut p rivilege, witho ut talkin g abo ut gen der, o p p ressio n , an d the mo vemen t. Given these daun tin g glo bal issues like climate chan ge an d un sustain able en ergy develo p men t that imp act virtually every segmen t o f human ity an d all life o n Mo ther Earth, it’s go in g take mo re than just the traditio n al eco lo gical kn o wledge base o f In digen o us Peo p les. It’s go in g to take mo re than the hard scien ce o f the Western wo rld. It’s go in g take a who le lo t o f thin gs because we’ve go n e p ast the n atural o rder o f thin gs. We n eed to sit at the table an d talk to gether to co me up with so lutio n s to achieve this, but this has been very difficult fo r p eo p le fro m o ur side to do because o f that access q uestio n , because o f that racism q uestio n . On e o f the thin gs that I’ve been do in g to p ro mo te access is to reach o ut to co mmun ities like Bio n eers because it’s a gro up with an in credible amo un t o f diversity; with them we can talk abo ut the disp ro p o rtio n ate imp acts that we face. Here we can bridge that gap an d have dialo gue. In digen o us Peo p les have made it very clear that we wan t to be a p art o f the so lutio n . We see a lo t o f thin gs hap p en in g n o w. Fo r examp le, So uth Dako ta is bein g called the Saudi Arabia o f win d p o wer. So we’re seein g o p p o rtun ities in the So uthwest fo r p ho to vo ltaic, so lar en ergy. In digen o us Peo p les have been p ushin g an d p ushin g fo r these p ro p er so lutio n s. We’re seein g a lo t o f argumen ts abo ut en ergy, argumen ts that p o sit that the develo p men t o f hydro gen en ergy o r gas en ergy are tran sito ry so lutio n s. The argumen t that a lo t o f big en viro s are usin g in their n ego tiatio n s with go vern men ts o f the wo rld o n issues o f en ergy an d climate chan ge is that gas is a tran sito ry en ergy, co al bed methan e. This is n o t true. Bo tto m lin e, the p laces these gas p lan ts are go in g be built, the p ip elin es, the territo ries they go thro ugh an d the extractio n p ro cess itself, the areas where it’s hap p en in g is in o ur n eck o f the wo o ds. This is n o t a so lutio n . This actually exacerbates the o n -the-gro un d situatio n that o ur p eo p le are facin g. We have to thin k abo ut that an d co me up with better so lutio n s. They’re already there, but we must create the p o litical will to get them to beco me a reality. On to p o f that, In digen o us Peo p les, p eo p le o f co lo r, an d white p eo p le n eed to be able to sit do wn an d really have a full an d mean in gful dialo gue. Particip atio n n eeds to be full an d mean in gful in these differen t debates that exist right n o w o n this to p ic, because it’s still a big issue fo r us to even have o ur vo ices heard. All o f the n atio n s o f the wo rld are rep resen ted by the Un ited Natio n s, but still the Red Natio n is n o t sittin g there at the table, an d yo u have to ask yo urself why. This p resen tatio n to o k p lace at the Bio n eers Co n feren ce in 2 0 0 5 . 2 7 S p eakin g fo r the V o iceless Richa r d Deer T r a ck It ap p ears that we have all fallen in to a dilemma o f bein g the to tal mass co n scio usn ess fo r what is go in g o n in the wo rld. Maybe we thin k, “Well, I’m n o t a p art o f that mass co n scio usn ess.” I certain ly co uld say that, but I must n o t fo rget that I had to get o n America West to co me to the Bio n eers in San Fran cisco , Califo rn ia, where I ren ted a car to get to Marin , then I to o k the car back an d ro de a shuttle to get back in to Marin . I am the to tal o f the who le o f what’s go in g o n in o ur wo rld to day. We’re talkin g abo ut glo balizatio n . I do n ’t thin k it’s surp risin g to kn o w that yo u are a p art o f that slave system that has been created by the co rp o ratio n s o f the wo rld. I live in an ado be ho use that was built by my gran dfather an d gran dmo ther. The walls are abo ut two -feet thick, the ceilin g is abo ut six- an d-a-half-feet high. I have two do gs, Oo gala an d Tally. I live alo n e. I was sittin g at my co mp uter bein g the cyber In dian that I am, an d all o f a sudden I heard these little vo ices—“blah, blah, blah.” What the heck’s go in ’ o n ? My daughter’s a teacher at a scho o l n ext do o r to me. She had bro ught her little o n es, five- an d six-year-o lds, p ro bably seven years o ld was the o ldest. They had all co me in to my yard because I have an ap p le tree there. They all wan ted to p ick an ap p le. It was a beautiful thin g that hap p en ed to me. I wen t o ut there an d I lo o ked at tho se little o n es an d I tho ught to myself, Y o u a r e the r ea s o n I’m go in g to co n fer en ces a n d s p ea kin g. Beca us e yo u a r e the vo iceles s o n es , yo u a r e the o n es tha t n o b o dy ca n ta lk fo r ; n o o n e ca n ta lk fo r yo u, b eca us e, a ltho ugh yo u s ee wha t is ha p p en in g, yo u do n ’t yet un der s ta n d it. Relatives, it to uched me to the co re. Because in a traditio n al so ciety where I co me fro m, it takes co urage to break the bo un ds o f that traditio n an d to co me o ut an d begin to sp eak abo ut what is go in g o n in the wo rld o utside. Yo u can be o stracized an d yo u can be p ut do wn fo r cro ssin g that bo un dary. At the same time, when yo u co me o ut here, the same thin g hap p en s to yo u. Because maybe yo u lo o k a little bit differen t; there are still a lo t o f discrimin ato ry attitudes to ward p eo p le. Relatives, that has go t to sto p , because whether we like it o r n o t, we live o n this Mo ther Earth to gether. Tho se discrimin ato ry lin es that we draw, whether they be o vert, o r whether they are made in silen ce, have to sto p . If I had a cho ice, an d this wo rld is co min g to a p o in t where we’re n o t go in g to be able to sto p what is go in g o n , if I co uld have taken tho se little o n es in to my ho use, with two -feet thick walls, an d said to them, “Co me in here, yo u’re go in g to be safe fro m whatever is hap p en in g, ” I wo uld have do n e it. But I co uld n o t guaran tee tho se little o n es that. Right n o w, we’re facin g the mo st critical time, right here in the Un ited States. It’s up to us to p ro tect tho se little o n es that are n o t here yet, tho se that are bo rn , tho se that are just gro win g up n o w, as adults. I have a little gran dso n ; he’s eight years o ld. His n ame is Rain , that’s his In dian n ame. The En glish n ame that we gave him is Tyler. I lo o k at my little gran dso n every day, an d I wo n der what kin d o f wo rld he is go in g to be livin g in when he’s my age. I always say to the relatives that I sp eak to , if yo u go o ut an d yo u bo rro w so methin g fro m yo ur n eighbo r, say yo u bo rro w a car fro m yo ur n eighbo r, what do yo u do to that car when yo u return it? Yo u clean it up , yo u wash the win do ws, yo u vacuum it o ut, yo u chan ge the o il, yo u p ut gas in it, an d yo u take it to yo ur n eighbo r an d yo u say, here, than k yo u. That is if yo u’re a resp o n sible p erso n . I hate to turn aro un d to my gran dso n an d say, “Gran dso n , here, this is what I have created fo r yo u, this wo rld that I live in , because I’m a p art o f the to tal mass co n scio usn ess that has created what is go in g o n .” We’ve go t to take resp o n sibility, an d that is o n e hell o f a thin g to try to do in the face o f what is go in g o n right n o w in o ur n atio n an d in the wo rld. If there is an ythin g that I brin g to yo u, I brin g a challen ge, a challen ge o f life, an d a challen ge that we can make a differen ce. Melissa men tio n ed that I’m a member o f the Native American Church. My gran dfather an d my gran dmo ther were my greatest teachers. They to ld me, they said, “Gran dso n , when yo u go in to that teep ee an d yo u sit in that circle, yo u meditate o n tho se thin gs that yo u wan t to chan ge in yo ur life. When yo u walk o ut the do o r, the do o r to that teep ee, an d the sun is co min g up in the mo rn in g, take fo ur step s an d live just the way yo u were thin kin g an d just the way yo u were meditatin g, o r p rayin g in the teep ee. That is the hardest thin g yo u are ever go in g to do .” I didn ’t believe her, an d I tried it. I co uldn ’t make two step s, because o ther thin gs came in to my min d. I saw o ther thin gs that chan ged my to tal attitude to ward the way we live. So I challen ge yo u to walk o ut the do o r an d try to live an d try to thin k o f the way that yo u wo uld wan t o ur en viro n men t to be. If yo u can do that, an d if yo u can co n vin ce just ten o ther p eo p le to do the same thin g, we’ll have it made. If o n e o f yo u makes it, let me kn o w, because we’re go in g to ho ld yo u up o n a p edestal. My mo ther died six years ago when she was n in ety-six years o ld. Her n ame was Medicin e Leaf, that was her In dian n ame. Her given Catho lic n ame was San tan ita. But I wen t do wn to see her o n e time n ear Christmas, an d she was sittin g at her table an d she was cryin g. I walked in an d I said, “Mo m, what’s the matter?” She said, “Yo u kn o w, so n , I wan t to buy a little gift fo r every o n e o f my little gran dchildren . But if I buy a gift fo r my little gran dchildren , I’m n o t go in g to be able to p ay fo r my gas to keep my ho use warm.” An d I said, “Mo m, yo u kn o w, all yo u have to do is tell me an d I’ll go do wn an d p ay yo ur gas bill.” She said, “So n , that’s n o t the p o in t. When yo u were gro win g up , yo u an d yo ur three bro thers wo uld each brin g a lo ad o f wo o d ho me fro m wherever yo u were, p ut it in a wo o den bo x, an d that’s ho w I heated my ho me. All I n eeded was a can o f kero sen e that co sts twen ty-five cen ts an d a lamp . That was my heatin g bill; that was my light bill. But as a result o f the man y chan ges that have o ccurred in o ur culture, we n o w have mo dern ho mes with bathro o ms, run n in g water, lights, the to tal system has chan ged.” We’re all go in g thro ugh that. It do esn ’t make an y differen ce who yo u are o r where yo u live, co rp o ratio n s are diggin g in to the shallo w p o ckets o f p o o r p eo p le, to o . They’ve all go t us.

We have a few o rgan izatio n s such as Bio n eers, en viro n men tal o rgan izatio n s, that are tryin g to sp eak fo r the vo iceless. In my o wn state, I rep resen t o n e o f tho se o rgan izatio n s, an d that’s the New Mexico En viro n men tal Law Cen ter.

If there’s an ythin g that we can do to gether, let’s do it. We can p reach to o n e an o ther, we can talk to o n e an o ther abo ut go o d thin gs, but it’s a differen t matter to take an actio n that is actually go in g to make a differen ce.

IMPLEMENTING VISIONS OF RE- INDIGENIZATION Greg Cajete: Each o f us has co me up with a p ersp ective that we’re ap p lyin g in a variety o f differen t ways, in wo rk with p lan ts, in wo rk with educatio n , in wo rk with mo thers, in wo rk with In digen o us fo o ds. We are co llectively tryin g to fin d a vehicle to essen tially re-in digen ize so me p ersp ectives in main stream thin kin g. In o ur o wn ways, we are tryin g to chan ge p ersp ectives with regard to in dividual, tribal, an d co llective un derstan din gs o f what this thin g called eco lo gy is. We are also lo o kin g at ho w to re-in digen ize o n a p ractical level. On e examp le o f a p ractical to o l In digen o us Peo p les can use to rein digen ize o urselves is fin din g, creatin g, o r bein g a p art o f in fo rmatio n clearin g ho uses. These p ro vide an d create o p p o rtun ities fo r Native Peo p les to co mmun icate with each o ther, o n n o t o n ly issues that deal with health, but also o n issues that deal with the en viro n men t an d so cial issues an d p o litical issues. In a sen se, the clearin gho uses have always been hap p en in g in In digen o us so cieties. They have always been evo lvin g as resp o n ses to o p p ressio n o r to vario us kin ds o f p ro blems o r crises that p eo p le have had. With the In tern et beco min g mo re a p art o f In digen o us so cieties, o r at least so me In digen o us Peo p les havin g access to that, yo u’re go in g to see a kin d o f develo p men t o f a clearin gho use kin d o f p hen o men o n . Yo u can see that already hap p en in g. I kn o w Jo hn Mo hawk created so methin g like that with the p ublicatio n o f Akwes a s n e No tes . So me o f the In dian n ewsp ap ers have always been , in a sen se, a fo rum an d also a kin d o f clearin gho use fo r in fo rmatio n dealin g with In digen o us issues an d health. But o n e o f the thin gs that we lack, gen erally, is access. In man y cases this is n o t o n ly access to reso urces in terms o f mo n ey but also accesses to o ther larger clearin gho uses that do exist that have a track reco rd o f dissemin atin g in fo rmatio n o n p ro jects, n utritio n , health issues, medicin e, water rights, an d so o n . Fo r In digen o us Peo p les, gen erally, we’re just in the very early stages o f begin n in g to see ho w we can utilize structures that are already in p lace, as well as begin to create o ur o wn , an d also p erp etuate the o n es that we have always had in so me fo rm. Again , it’s a struggle to do that. We’re always lo o kin g fo r p laces that we can , in a sen se, brin g up so me o f these ideas o r brin g these p ersp ectives in to a greater audien ce. We do have issues that deal with n utritio n an d with health, an d tho se issues will co n tin ue an d be a very imp o rtan t p art o f what we do , as In digen o us Peo p le, as we n etwo rk with each o ther. Fo r examp le, I’ll be go in g to New Zealan d n ext mo n th fo r the first In digen o us Educatio n Co n feren ce amo n g the Mao ri In digen o us Peo p les an d o ther In digen o us gro up s. So we actually already have so me n etwo rks that we are wo rkin g with. Bio n eers is certain ly a p art o f that. It’s at the edges. We p articip ate in this, but we also have o ur o wn n etwo rks that we wo rk with as well. So I thin k tho se thin gs are very p ro bable an d p o ssible. John Mohawk: To discuss the issue o f re-in digen izatio n I wo uld like to frame it with so me co n text abo ut ho w thin gs are to day. Ho w in the mo rn in g n ewsp ap er the n ews was that n o t o n ly is the Bo rn eo rain fo rest bein g burn ed do wn but the p eo p le that gave the p eo p le the matches to burn it do wn go t a big gran t fro m the In tern atio n al Mo n etary Fun d ( IMF) . Kn o win g that, I wan t to say that we’re at a p erio d n o w when we’re seein g the en d, o r at least we’re begin n in g to see the begin n in g o f the en d o f five hun dred years o f co lo n izatio n . The five hun dred years o f co lo n izatio n was abo ut the gro ssest fo rms o f exp lo itatio n o f life o n earth, human life an d n o n human life, just an in credible p erio d. Of co urse it resulted in man y, man y extin ctio n s— extin ctio n s o f p eo p les, extin ctio n s o f an imals, p lan ts—everythin g there is. We’ve been livin g thro ugh this very, very terrible p erio d o f co n q uest. This co n q uest is still, o f co urse, very much alive in vario us p arts o f the wo rld. But we also can fin d p laces in the wo rld where the co n q uest has go n e by. It has go n e p ast us. In tho se p laces there’s sp ace fo r re-in digen izatio n , which I say mean s to rebuild that which was there befo re that hap p en ed, bo th in the fo rm o f human cultures an d in the fo rm o f brin gin g back the bio diversity that existed p rio r to the co lo n izatio n . At the same time, there’s a p o ssibility n o w o f gatherin g co n scio usn ess amo n g man y hun dreds o f millio n s o f p eo p le abo ut ho w this is n o t o n ly n ecessary but is a very go o d thin g, a p o sitive thin g. This n ew co n scio usn ess will help us rethin k terms like mo dern ism an d p ro gress, an d reexamin e where thin gs are go in g, even to rethin k what cap italism can mean . If cap italism as we’ve kn o wn it can be a very destructive p ro cess, then we have to redefin e it. We have to redefin e ho w wealth is p ro duced an d distributed, an d review all tho se kin ds o f issues. So re-in digen izatio n mean s that we’re lo o kin g at a visio n o f the wo rld in a p o stco n q uest, p o stmo dern ist, p o stp ro gressive era. On ce we see that, we can co me to ways to make that real. Ho w we act to make that real is what the In digen o us visio n is n o w. So it’s the re-bio diversity, the recultural diversity, the rethin kin g o f the earth as a livin g bein g. All o f that is what I thin k re-in digen izatio n mean s. Julio V alladolid R ivera: In the An des o f Perú, the An dean culture is thrivin g. The ca mp es in o s , who seed their little acreage an d scattered p arcels do n o t n eed to re-in digen ize themselves. We, the agricultural techn ician s who co me fro m these rural areas an d have go n e o ff to un iversity—we are the o n es who n eed to re-in digen ize o urselves. Our p ro fessio n al train in g has n o t allo wed us to see the vast richn ess o f agro bio diversity p o ssessed in the kn o wledge o f cultivatio n in the An dean culture. As techn ician s, we are in terested in p lan tin g fo r maximum p ro ductio n . We do n ’t n o tice that the camp esin o cultivates with care an d dedicatio n . I had to immerse myself fo r a lo n g time in a p erio d o f rein digen izatio n , learn in g fro m them. So , the in fo rmatio n abo ut the cultivatio n o f An dean p lan ts that were gro wn thro ugh the ap p licatio n o f scien tific metho ds have been o f little use to them. So I n eeded to learn fro m the camp esin o s ho w to co n verse with the p lan ts—ho w to attun e myself to the wild p lan ts that “tell us,” with their great o r little flo werin g, whether the gro win g seaso n is go in g to be rain y o r with few rain s. This is very imp o rtan t in arid farmin g that abso lutely dep en ds o n rain . In the An des o rigin ated o n e o f the o ldest fo rms o f agriculture ( ten tho usan d years o ld) in the wo rld. At the p o stgraduate level I to o k a master’s co urse in gen etic imp ro vemen t o f p lan ts an d n o t o n e co urse in structed me in this typ e o f agriculture. Previo usly, when I carried o ut scien tific exp erimen ts, I liked to weigh, measure, an d p ho to grap h every p art o f the p lan t. I was in terested in determin in g the dry weight o f each o n e o f these p arts, so that afterward I co uld chart the “gro wth curves,” usin g the mo st so p histicated statistical metho ds in such a fashio n that these curves co uld be exp ressed thro ugh mathematical fo rmulas. Greg Cajete: The act o f re-in digen izatio n is really multip le leveled, an d it’s hap p en in g in man y ways in In dian co un try to day. It’s a resp o n se to man y o f the thin gs that we kn o w we n eed an d that we have to fin d ways to reco ver. My area is educatio n an d I had the o p p o rtun ity o f havin g two educatio n s: o n e that was traditio n al an d also o n e that was fo rmal. In every sen se o f the wo rd, we are in the p ro cess o f begin n in g to defin e an educatio n p ro cess that is go in g to wo rk fo r us. No t fo r the in stitutio n s, n o t fo r the go vern men t, but o n e that is go in g to wo rk fo r us. I thin k that all the kin ds o f thin gs that yo u say, esp ecially within the last twen ty years, in terms o f In dian p eo p le brin gin g themselves up an d begin n in g to lo o k at themselves o n ce again with so me level o f dign ity an d an un derstan din g o f the p ro blems an d the issues an d the ethn o stress that we have all faced, an d then co min g to terms with that, has really been a very, very dramatic p ro cess. It’s been a healin g p ro cess an d we’re still go in g thro ugh that in o ur co mmun ities. Amo n g p ueblo p eo p le, we are so me o f the mo st traditio n al p eo p le in the Un ited States in terms o f n ative traditio n s. Our situatio n has n o t been so much tryin g to reco ver what we have lo st but to actually p reserve an d to take again a n ew resp ect fo r what we have. That is a differen t p ro cess than reco very an d revitalizatio n . It’s really step p in g back an d valuin g again so methin g that yo u gen erally had taken fo r gran ted because yo u grew up with it. That has been my exp erien ce with Pueblo p eo p le—we n eed situatio n s that brin g us back, to reemp hasize the imp o rtan t thin gs that we kn o w are p art o f o ur culture an d o ur co mmun ities. So In digen o us educatio n an d in digen izatio n have man y levels o f mean in g. It’s very tribally sp ecific. Each tribe attemp ts to address these issues that are in vo lved with this re-in digen izatio n co n cep t in their o wn ways. After five hun dred years o f havin g to adap t to a co lo n ial p o wer, I thin k that we’re fin ally in a p o sitio n to begin to describe an d to create a co n temp o rary educatio n al exp ressio n that wo rks fo r us. If yo u study the situatio n s o f all p eo p les in the wo rld, they go thro ugh this p ro cess o f struggle an d o f revitalizatio n . Even tually there co mes a p o in t where p eo p le realize that we have to make an educatio n system that wo rks fo r o urselves. That’s really where we’re at. This in cludes recap turin g the farmin g traditio n s amo n g my p eo p le, the fishin g traditio n s amo n g my p eo p le. Amo n g o ther p eo p les it’s the traditio n o f again farmin g o r hun tin g o r fishin g o r p ro tectin g the fo rest, o r p ro tectin g the deserts, o r fightin g fo r water rights. All o f tho se typ es o f issues co me in to p lay as yo u begin to co me up an d truly beco me who yo u are. So these are the situatio n s that yo u’ll fin d in In digen o us so ciety an d they’re all a p art o f this p ro cess o r this idea that we call in digen izatio n . CULTURAL RIGHTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Julio V alladolid R ivera: I’ve acq uain ted myself with so me p lan t varieties, like q uin o a, o f An dean o rigin that were p aten ted in the Un ited States. I wo n der if it is fair that o n ly tho se who p aten t receive p rivileges an d n o t to reco gn ize the rights in these p aten ts that also belo n g to the camp esin o s, who have ten ded an d main tain ed these varieties with care an d dedicatio n fo r o ver ten tho usan d years. The p easan ts o f the An des who were the o n es that created these varieties received n o co mp en satio n fo r this. This is a typ e o f bio p iracy. On the o ther han d, the p ractice o f claimin g the “rights o f in tellectual p ro p erty” o f the camp esin o s with their p lan t varieties is a techn ical p ro cess —legally co mp licated an d co stly. It req uires sp ecialized scien tists, which is at this time o utside o f the eco n o mic ran ge o f the camp esin o s; this is why this matter, fro m the p o in t o f view o f the typ ical camp esin o , is “a p o in tless affair.” The An dean culture is gen ero us. The camp esin o s will always co n tin ue to o ffer their p lan ts to tho se who ask fo r them. They say that if they ask fo r them, they n eed them to feed their families an d it is go o d that they take them. It n ever o ccurs to them that tho se p lan ts are taken an d freq uen tly p aten ted fo r their p ro p erties, fo r which they claim legal rights. In the co smic view o f the An dean camp esin o s, everythin g is alive: the hills, the clo uds, the stars, the lakes, the ro cks, an d all o f n ature, to tho se who lo ve them an d resp ect them, like the mo ther who created them an d p ro tects them. In the n ative lan guage Quechua, it’s called Pachamama ( Mo ther Earth) . An dean wisdo m co n sists n o t o n ly o f n urturin g Pachamama with care an d resp ect but also o f allo win g fo r n urturan ce b y Pachamama. Receivin g the care an d resp ect o f Mo ther Earth is to reestablish a relatio n ship o f resp ect fo r n ature an d is the surest way to lo o k after the co n tin uatio n o f life o n earth. John Mohawk: This q uestio n regardin g the issue o f in tellectual p ro p erty rights is o n e o f tho se that I p erso n ally do n ’t like to address. I was very much struck by the reactio n that hap p en ed in the summer o f 1 9 9 7 in German y after so meo n e wro te the bo o k Hitler ’s Willin g Executio n er s . They held a who le series o f meetin gs in German y. The German p eo p le ackn o wledged that fifty-five years ago , o rdin ary, everyday German s were in vo lved in the daily activity o f ho rren do us murder—the co ld-blo o ded murder o f wo men an d children . They go t up in the mo rn in g—o rdin ary, everyday German s—an d p erfo rmed ho rrible crimes. It wasn ’t the Nazis, it wasn ’t a little gro up o f demo n ized p eo p le. It was o rdin ary p eo p le who go t up ; acco un tan ts, lawyers, do cto rs, an d they wen t o ut there an d killed p eo p le. It wasn ’t all in the gas chambers. It was up clo se an d p erso n al. What was strikin g to me abo ut that is ho w, acro ss histo ry, that’s hap p en ed so man y times. To o man y times. Yo u thin k abo ut the Sp an ish in the Caribbean Islan ds between 1 4 9 2 an d 1 5 1 6 . They go t up in the mo rn in g an d wen t o ut an d co mmitted to rture an d murder. When the first An glo s reached Califo rn ia they wen t abo ut systematically murderin g the In dian s. Lo o k at Tasman ia. Lo o k at the Ban ta p eo p le. Yo u can see this p ro cess all acro ss histo ry. It wasn ’t a bun ch o f crazed crimin als that did these thin gs. It was o rdin ary, everyday p eo p le who did them. We lo o k back an d say, well, that hap p en ed a lo n g time ago . No it didn ’t. It’s hap p en in g right n o w in the wo rld to day. Fo rty tho usan d children die in the wo rld every sin gle day. The majo r in stitutio n s o f Western eco n o mic adjustmen ts, called “restructurin g,” have p o licies in p lace an d the p urp o se o f these p o licies is to sp read hun ger an d to create destitute p eo p le who are p o werless in the wo rld. We do n o t have a system that seeks to p ro mo te life. We have a system that seeks to p ro mo te p ro fit, an d the co st o f the p ro fit is hun ger an d death o n a day-to -day basis. Ordin ary, everyday p eo p le p reten d that they’re blin d to that. They’re n o t o utraged by that. They do n ’t kn o w abo ut it. They’ll talk to yo u abo ut this, that, an d the o ther thin g. They’re co mp letely o blivio us to it. We give that kin d o f behavio r n ames like eco n o mic glo balizatio n . Why do n ’t we call it eco n o mic extermin atio n ? Let’s be clear. Yo u n o tice I’m still reactin g to the mo rn in g p ap er. All the o ran gutan s are n o w gettin g killed o ff in Bo rn eo by fire. Essen tially, fire is a p ro duct o f eco n o mic glo balizatio n . It’s o ur mo men t when the sp o tlight o f wo rld co lo n izatio n an d do min atio n is p o in ted at so me p lace an d, o f co urse, the victims o f that p lace aren ’t always p eo p le. So metimes the victims o f that p lace are eco systems. So metimes they’re o ran gutan s. I thin k that when we talk abo ut re-in digen izatio n , we n eed a much larger, bigger umbrella to un derstan d it. It’s n o t n ecessarily abo ut the In digen o us Peo p les o f a sp ecific p lace; it’s a b o ut r e-in digen izin g the p eo p les o f the p la n et to the p la n et. It’s abo ut us lo o kin g at the who le thin g in the bro adest o f p o ssible ways. So that’s ho w co me I have a p ro blem with in tellectual p ro p erty rights. What co lo n izatio n was abo ut was the co mmo dificatio n o f everythin g. That’s what co lo n izatio n mean s. To day, it’s the co lo n izatio n o f abstract thin gs. It’s the co lo n izatio n in which a p ro p erty right is attached to so methin g that the p erso n who has it didn ’t in ven t. Essen tially, n ature in ven ted it, the co lo n ist man ip ulated it, an d n o w he wan ts to claim it fo r the p urp o se o f havin g a p ro fit. As I un derstan d it, the main p urp o se o f this is that big seed co mp an ies can sell seeds to the p o o rest p eo p le in the wo rld an d charge them fo r their fo o d that way. What we’re lo o kin g at here is the tremen do us reality o f what we thin k o f as glo balizatio n . All o f these thin gs are p art o f that p ro cess that co n cen trates the wealth o f the wo rld in the han ds o f the smallest n umber o f p eo p le. This p ro cess is almo st always do n e thro ugh the use o f fo rce, o f the state, an d thro ugh the use o f the mo ral twistin g o f o rdin ary, everyday p eo p le’s co n scio usn ess. That’s why I say “o rdin ary, everyday p eo p le.” We have to reach o rdin ary, everyday p eo p le. Ordin ary, everyday p eo p le have to have their sen se o f mo ral in justice ign ited. It has to be raised a bit. They have to co me to un derstan d that they are called up o n to care abo ut what hap p en s to the p eo p les an d livin g thin gs o f this wo rld. That’s a huge jo b, but that’s the called-up o n sp iritual call o f the re-in digen izatio n o f the wo rld. Greg Cajete: I wan t to brin g to yo ur atten tio n the fact that an y rights are essen tially abo ut resp ect. On e o f the ways that we’ve dealt with this in p ueblo so ciety is that everythin g we do has a traditio n o f p rivacy, a traditio n o f secrecy. That’s basically the way we’ve dealt with in fo rmatio n . It’s a strategy that evo lved as a result o f o ur situatio n s as we faced the Sp an ish an d had to go un dergro un d with o ur religio n an d with o ur p ractices. In the 1 9 2 0 s we also had to defen d o urselves with regard to the federal go vern men t that o utlawed p ueblo religio n . So we have a lo n g histo ry o f dealin g with this resp ect issue with o thers. Tho se are the thin gs that will begin to be co n tin ued with so vereign ty an d with educatio n an d certain ly with cultural p ro p erty rights. Essen tially, we have learn ed fro m o n e an o ther that we are n o t resp ected an d un til we begin to see that kin d o f resp ect bein g rekin dled at the in stitutio n al level, an d go vern men tal level esp ecially, then yo u’ll co n tin ue to see issues that deal with p ro p erty rights amo n g Native Peo p les bein g very dramatic in terms o f their discussio n o r their o utco me. I wan t to brin g yo ur atten tio n to the fact that it’s No vember 1 an d amo n g p ueblo p eo p les, this is a very sacred time. It has to do with fo o d, in ciden tally. It has to do with a very sp ecial kin d o f ceremo n y that all the p ueblo s are do in g as we sp eak, that deals with the sacramen t o f fo o d an d the p ayin g o f resp ects to where fo o d co mes fro m, an d also a thin g called feedin g the an cesto rs. Every sin gle p ueblo ho useho ld is do in g this right n o w. So as yo u thin k abo ut yo ur relatio n ship to fo o d, as yo u thin k abo ut the In digen o us p ersp ective, I ask that yo u remember that the In digen o us p hilo so p hy is really embo died in so me very simp le but very p ro fo un d ritual activities that we p erfo rm durin g the who le year. In so me fo rm, in so me way, we’re do in g differen t thin gs to en sure this relatio n ship , an d this co mmun icatio n p ro cess that is vital to o urselves an d also to the p erp etuatio n o f life o n earth. If yo u ever see an In digen o us ceremo n y yo u’re go in g to see that every ceremo n y in o n e way o r an o ther is tied to a cen tral co n cep t o f seekin g life an d reaffirmin g life. This p articular thin g that’s go in g o n in p ueblo co un try is a very sp ecial ceremo n y. It’s a very sp ecial thin g because even tho ugh I’m away fro m that, I’m co n n ected to that. It is n o thin g mo re than simp ly takin g whatever yo u’re go in g to eat at this din n er meal—takin g a bit an d p iece o f that—an d rememberin g where it has co me fro m; certain ly rememberin g that fo o d is life an d fo o d is sacred. Then p lacin g it in a n atural p lace, whether it’s a tree o r simp ly ro llin g it up an d takin g it so mewhere an d dep o sitin g it where the dirt is, where the water is, p uttin g it in a sp ecial p lace, an d sayin g yo ur o wn sp ecial than ksgivin g, if yo u will, fo r what that fo o d mean s to yo u symbo lically an d o therwise. Of co urse, there’s mo re to that than this, but it is a simp le act o f reveren ce. My visio n fo r In digen o us Peo p les at this p o in t is that we co me in to o ur o wn fin ally as a gro up o f p eo p le who have co me thro ugh a lo n g jo urn ey with a great struggle an d have again co me to fin d o urselves an d to see o urselves o n ce again with dign ity. I thin k that’s a very simp le statemen t but in man y cases it’s a very difficult thin g to do . Fo r me educatio n is a p assio n . I believe it is thro ugh the educatio n al p ro cess, at whatever level yo u may cho o se o r whatever exp ressio n yo u may fin d in it, that will ultimately make the greatest differen ce. Educatio n abo ut resp ect. Educatio n abo ut p ro p erty rights. Educatio n abo ut co lo n izatio n an d deco lo n izatio n . Educatio n as it relates to p lan ts an d also o ur co mmo n co n n ectio n as In digen o us Peo p les o f this earth. So my visio n is that we fin d a way thro ugh the p ro cess o f educatio n , thro ugh the p ro cess o f in teractio n , to fin d o ur face, to fin d o ur heart, to fin d a fo un datio n thro ugh which we may mo st co mp letely exp ress o ur life. I q uo ted that basically fro m a Nahuatl p hrase that co mes thro ugh a p iece o f p o etry that was p reserved after the burn in g o f the man y libraries in Mexico . But I thin k it embo dies what educatio n n eeds to be an d can be an d it certain ly is the ideal visio n that I have fo r the n ext gen eratio n o f In digen o us Peo p les. John Mohawk: I thin k what hap p en ed so metime aro un d 1 4 5 0 , begin n in g aro un d there, is that the who le culture fell in to a p erio d o f madn ess. It fell in to a p erio d o f madn ess when it wen t o n a murdero us ramp age again st p eo p le that it p erceived to be the p urveyo rs o f magic. It fo un d tho se p eo p le an d the o n es who did the herb medicin es, an d mo st o f tho se p eo p le that did herbal medicin e they fo un d were wo men , an d they wen t o n a murder an d to rture ramp age again st wo men in Euro p e that lasted three hun dred years. At the same time, they were exp an din g acro ss the glo be an d they ran in to o ther p eo p le who were also do in g herbal medicin es an d were co n n ected to n ature in man y o ther ways that were far mo re p ro fo un d than the Euro p ean s had remembered. They’d already lo st all o f that. They wen t o n a murdero us ramp age again st tho se p eo p le. An d then they turn ed to n ature itself an d they wen t o n a murdero us ramp age again st n ature. Yo u just have to lo o k at the o rigin s o f the thin kin g abo ut that an d Fran cis Baco n an d ho w early scien ce so rted itself o ut. All the while that was go in g o n , it was do n e at the head o f their academic wo rld, claimin g that they were the p urveyo rs o f ratio n al tho ught. What a lie. What so ciety has exercised mo re irratio n al p assio n s fo r mo re evil than this so ciety? Yet all o f us who have gro wn up in co n tact with that so ciety, tho se o f us who grew up within reach o f its radio waves kn o w that, fo r fifty years they have been p o un din g a message in to o ur brain s that future uto p ian so cieties can be built o n a fo un datio n o f techn o lo gy an d a fo un datio n o f en gin eerin g an d that that’s go in g to build a wo n derful future wo rld. At the same mo men t, what’s been hap p en in g is that the bio lo gical fo un datio n o f o ur wo rld is bein g ero ded by exactly tho se p eo p le who sto o d to p ro fit fro m that ideo lo gy. All o f us watchin g what was go in g o n saw n o thin g but a big advertisin g camp aign . All o f us who grew up in that milieu, all o f us who ’ve been in the Western educatio n al system, have been co n tin uo usly to ld that o n the o n e han d, this is ratio n al so ciety. On the o ther han d, it has dimin ished the fact that ratio n ality is o n ly a ten den cy in Western culture. There are a who le bun ch o f o ther ten den cies an d they’re mo st o f the o n es in p o wer right at this min ute. At an y given mo men t, it’s tho se o ther ten den cies that are in p o wer. That’s ho w co me in tellectuals are n ever in p o wer in Western go vern men t an ywhere in the wo rld. Has an ybo dy ever n o ticed that? My fin al tho ught is that tho se o f us who are co n scio us o f this co n tradictio n are reco verin g fro m Western culture. We’re in reco very fro m that. It is that reco very that we must p ut o ur atten tio n to —a reco very that in vo lves the who le issue o f medicin e an d p lan t life; the reco very o f co mmun ity, the reco very o f what real, exten ded family can mean . In mo st o f o ur cases, we can o n ly start to thin k abo ut that at this p o in t. We’re in reco very fro m the effects o f mo re than five cen turies o f what o n ly can be described as cultural madn ess. We’re iden tifyin g it. We’re un derstan din g it better. We’re makin g it clearer an d clearer to o n e an o ther. We’re a co mmun ity o f p eo p le who are n o t o n ly co mmitted to un derstan din g it, we’re co mmitted to fin din g areas o f p ractice where we can start to p eel layers o f it o ff o urselves, o f the p eo p le in o ur family, the p eo p le in o ur co mmun ities, the p eo p le that we wo rk with in o ur wo rkp laces. That, I thin k is a n o ble effo rt. But I have to say that I thin k that it’s really hard to exp ress to p eo p le the dep th o f the n ature o f the damage do n e to us in dividually an d co llectively. My o wn sen se o f this is that there’s really a lo t o f ho p e an d a lo t o f activity go in g o n . Yo u co uld n o t have had meetin gs like Bio n eers fo rty years ago . Yo u co uldn ’t have do n e it. There wo uldn ’t have been an ybo dy there to grasp an ythin g. But I thin k n o w they’re here an d they’re hap p y. They’re en ergetic an d p eo p le are n o t o n ly talkin g abo ut the theo ry, we’ve go tten to the day where we’re startin g to talk mo re an d mo re abo ut the p ractice. We still n eed to build the theo ry mo re. We still n eed to un derstan d exactly ho w thin gs came abo ut. We have to un derstan d ho w we un do tho se, ho w we un ho o k the majo r thin gs that p ull this, the en ergy that p ulls this. But I tell yo u, we kn o w the madn ess n o w, we’ve iden tified the madn ess n o w, an d we’re o n o ur way to figurin g o ut ho w to co un ter it. Julio V alladolid R ivera: In the An dean co n cep t o f life, everythin g is alive —the p lan ts, the hills, the stars, the rivers. Everythin g is alive. An d everythin g is o ur family.

Peasan t families in the An des p rep are fo o d that their dead an cesto rs like an d they p ut this fo o d o ut o n table fo r the dead because, as I said, even the dead are alive.

As we sen d o ut sage smo ke as o ur o fferin g to each directio n , we will rep eat fo ur times an an cien t Nahuatl wo rd that, even in the sixteen th cen tury, eluded an y clear defin itio n but that fun ctio n s as a greetin g an d callin g to the sp irits. In 1 6 2 9 in co lo n ial Mexico , Hern an do Ruiz de Alarcó n wro te that the Nahuatl n atives wo uld call to the fo ur directio n s at the begin n in g o f rituals by rep eatin g, fo ur times, the wo rd ta hui, an an cien t exp ressio n that even he was n o t able to decip her: “[The n atives] rep eat fo ur times this wo rd ta hui, which n o bo dy un derstan ds to day,” he writes in his Tr ea tis e.2 In the Nahuatl traditio n , No rth is the directio n o f the p rimo rdial elemen t earth an d the lo catio n o f the Lan d o f the Dead, Mictlá n , which is ruled by a duality that is bo th female an d male, Mictla n cihua tl an d Mictla n tecuhtli, the Lady an d the Lo rd o f the Lan d o f the Dead. We begin by facin g No rth an d callin g o n o ur an cesto rs who , it is said, came o rigin ally fro m the No rth—to gran t us their wisdo m. An d we do so by callin g o ut ta hui! to ward that directio n fo ur times. We then ho n o r the directio n o f the East that embo dies Fire; fro m this directio n the sun rises every day. East is the directio n o f o ur birth, o f o ur childho o d an d yo uth, o f p assio n , an d it is ruled by an o ther female/male duality, Xo chiq uetza l, the Precio us Flo wer, an d Xo chip illi, the Lo rd o f the Flo wers, who are the p ro tecto rs o f lo ve, o f the arts an d p o etry, an d o f what is really mo st p recio us in life. So that we can co n tin ue en jo yin g the gifts o f the arts in all o ur en deavo rs, we turn to the East an d evo ke that directio n by sayin g again tahui! fo ur times. Next, we ho n o r the directio n o f the So uth—o f Water, o f the green lan d o f abun dan t rain , o f co rn , o f jito ma tito s , fr ijo lito s , an d chilito s . That’s the fertile lan d o f Meso america where my fa milia an d an cesto rs came fro m. The directio n o f the So uth is dedicated to ho n o r all wo men an d is mo ved by an o ther female/male duality, Cha lchiuhtlicue, the Lady o f the Streams, an d Tlá lo c, the Lo rd o f Rain . An d so that we can have the sp ro utin g, clean sin g, an d healin g p o wer o f Water with us, we face So uth an d again in vo ke fo ur times the wo rd tahui! Then we ackn o wledge the West. This is the directio n o f Win d where the sun go es do wn at the en d o f the day. In the Nahuatl traditio n , the West also rep resen ts the en d o f o ur life jo urn ey. An d as the sun sets in the western ho rizo n , it is Tla zo lteo tl, the Mo ther o f All Seaso n s, who waits fo r us at the en d o f o ur days. She is the all-fo rgivin g Mo ther who makes us all again p art o f the earth, in the sacred cycle o f life an d death. This directio n ho n o rs all warrio rs, who —like the revered Meso american cultural hero Quetza lco a tl, the Feathered Serp en t—are willin g to dedicate themselves fo r the bettermen t o f all human ity. When we celebrate the Day o f the Dead, we are co n n ectin g with o ur an cesto rs, an d so that we may have faith in o urselves an d ho p e in the future, here we in vo ke Tla zo lteo tl an d Quetza lco a tl, the Lady an d Lo rd o f the West an d great p ro tecto rs o f human ity, by chan tin g fo ur times ta hui! In the Meso american traditio n there is also a fifth directio n ; man y p eo p le seem to be un aware o f it, an d so , there is a lo t o f debate o n this o n e. So me say that the fifth directio n is up to ward the sky, so me say that it’s do wn deep in side the gro un d. Meso american tla ma n tin e, wise Elders, exp lain that the fifth directio n is really the p erso n n ext to yo u. There is a very p o werful Maya man tra that summarizes the best o f human ethics: In La k’ Ech, which tran slates as Tú er es mi o tr o yo ( Yo u are my o ther I) . In the in vo catio n o f the fifth directio n , we all turn an d face each o ther. Everyo n e is truly a mirro r o f each o ther: that n o se, tho se eyes, that mo uth, that p erso n yo u see in fro n t o f yo u is in reality yo urself lo o kin g at yo urself. But each o f us is also an irrep laceable an d un iq ue human win do w to the un iverse. That’s why we n o w in vo ke the an cesto rs o f all the p eo p le co n gregated here an d call o n the sp irits o f all traditio n s to jo in us as we say to each o ther fo ur times the sacred call an d greetin g: tahui! I have to co n fess that it is with so me hesitatio n —an d after literally ago n izin g fo r weeks—that I p ut in writin g, with so me detail, a ritual that, fo r the mo st p art, fo r me an d man y o thers, is really p art o f an an cien t o ral traditio n . Perso n ally, I have facilitated o r p erfo rmed the an cien t Meso american ritual I exp lain ed abo ve hun dreds o f times. I have do n e this in the mo st diverse settin gs, literally co verin g mo st asp ects o f human even ts, fro m in timate rites markin g life, like weddin gs an d fun erals, to p ublic ceremo n ies in vo lvin g hun dreds o f p eo p le ( so me even a few tho usan d) . On ce, I even did it in the Sen ate Chamber o f the Califo rn ia State Cap ito l, in Sacramen to , durin g the o fficial in auguratio n ceremo n y o f a lieuten an t go vern o r. But I have co me to the co n clusio n that, like p o etry, this is so methin g I didn ’t really cho o se to do , rather, it’s so methin g that “has cho sen ” me. Let me elabo rate a bit mo re o n what I’m sayin g here. When man y o f my clo sest frien ds were dyin g o f AIDS durin g the early 1 9 8 0 s in San Fran cisco — where I lived at the time—it was me, the mo st agn o stic an d least “sp iritual” o f the gro up , who , maybe o ut o f frustratio n an d a sen se o f imp o ten ce befo re death, dared to sp eak up an d take up la p a la b r a . I remember feelin g a very p ain ful sen se o f silen ce as I sto o d in a circle o f frien ds, aro un d a dearest frien d, who lay dead in the middle o f a bed in side a Missio n District flat that had been min e un til so me years p rio r. We all sto o d mute fo r a lo n g time an d then just started cryin g, feelin g help less, defeated, rejected, co n demn ed to suffer the in sufferable, with n o wo rds to weep o ur so rro w, n o p rayer to heal o ur wo un ds. Mo st o f us had been raised as Catho lics but did n o t wan t to relap se to that faith system that, as adults, we fo un d very o p p ressive an d ho mo p ho bic. It was with an ger an d a sen se o f desp eratio n that Nahuatl wo rd fo rmulas an d p rayers that I had learn ed fro m my Gran dma Elvirita in Mexico an d fro m o ther Elders came rushin g to my mo uth, an d I have n o t sto p p ed esp o usin g this wisdo m ever sin ce. RECLAIMING OUR MESOAMERICAN HERITAGE We are n o w go in g to mo ve to an examin atio n o f Meso america. Let’s go back sixty tho usan d years, back to the time o f the first human dwellers o f Meso america, the cultural regio n ( n o w Mexico an d Cen tral America) that existed befo re the arrival o f the Euro p ean s.*1 4 It is a very imp o rtan t p lace fo r man y reaso n s; fro m this geo grap hical area o f the wo rld so me o f the mo st o rigin al human civilizatio n s have emerged.

When I was seven years o ld I wen t to the to p o f the Pyramid o f the Sun in Teo tihua cá n , an archaeo lo gical site lo cated abo ut thirty miles n o rtheast o f Mexico City.

I have called this p raxis, mes ticis mo , which p urp o sely co mbin es Mestizo /Mestiza an d mis ticis mo ( “mysticism”) , to differen tiate it fro m mes tiza je.

RECLAIMING A SYNCRETIC ECOPOETICS Fo r me, this n ew liberatin g Mestizo /Mestiza co n scio usn ess n o t o n ly embraces “o thers” as eq ual an d un iq ue human bein gs but also calls fo r a n ew glo bal awaren ess o f the “o n en ess” o f all livin g creatures an d o f n ature as a who le. This visio n o f the “o n en ess” o f all life is shared by man y o f the an cien t earth-wo rship p in g religio n s, the shaman istic sp iritual traditio n s o f Native Peo p les in the Americas, Siberia, an d o ther p arts o f Asia.

Nahuatl is a co mp o un d lan guage in which n ew n o un s can be fo rmed by brin gin g to gether differen t wo rds.

This really defies the Western lo gic o f En glish sin ce it wo uld mean “I-am-the-bo o k,” which in En glish do esn ’t make much sen se, but in Nahuatl, n a ma tl makes p erfect sen se.

So me p eo p le mistaken ly refer to it as the “Mexican Hallo ween .” But this is a syn cretic celebratio n that, o n the surface, is a Catho lic feast but in reality is a co mmemo ratio n o f Meso american sp irituality. In stead o f the fear o f death an d the co ver o f disguises p reten din g to trick death, there is a celebratio n an d accep tan ce o f the cycle o f life that in cludes death.

Ho w do we ren ew o ur In digen o us Kn o wledge systems an d resist what Van dan a Shiva calls “mo n o cultures o f the min d?” Ho w do we revitalize o urselves fro m the in side o ut? A To n gan Elder frien d Emile Wo lfgramm always asks the q uestio n , “Are we wo rthy o f the co n sp iracy o f o ur an cesto rs?” These q uestio n s help me reflect o n my tho ughts an d actio n s, an d ho w I an swer them lets me kn o w if I’m bein g p art o f the p ro blem o r p art o f the so lutio n . Parap hrasin g what Albert Ein stein an d man y visio n aries after him have stated, we can n o t so lve o ur glo bal crisis with the same tho ught p ro cess that created it. In digen o us Peo p les have sustain able, time-tested p ractices that go back tho usan ds o f years. Pro fo un d exp erien ces an d co n n ectio n s to n ature are in culcated in sp iritual an d o ther p ractices. These p lace-sp ecific “Origin al In structio n s” are bluep rin ts fo r ho w to live sustain ably within o ur ho me eco systems. No t o n ly do they guide us o n ho w to p o sitively in teract with the en viro n men t—p lan ts, an imals, trees, win ds, fire, clo uds, rain , so ils, stars, an d o ther life-fo rms—but they also describe ho w to in teract with “all o ur relatio n s”—p eo p le within clan s, villages, tribes, n atio n s, an d o ther p eo p les o f the wo rld. Whether a n eighbo rin g tribe, an in sect n atio n , an islan d p eo p le, o r an un seen relative, the Origin al In structio n s give us ethics an d p ro to co ls fo r ho w to ho n o r an d resp ect this gift o f life in its man y man ifestatio n s. It’s very imp o rtan t that we reco gn ize these sp ecial teachin gs within o ur o wn traditio n al kn o wledge system an d resp ect the diversity o f “in structio n s” given to o ther cultures. By ho n o rin g who we are as Native Peo p les we are able to un derstan d o ther cultures’ struggles. This un derstan din g en ables us to stan d in so lidarity with o ther In digen o us Natio n s an d ethn ic co mmun ities. To gether we can sup p o rt each o ther’s effo rts to heal, an d to resto re o urselves fro m the sto rm o f co lo n izatio n . There are man y differen t ways that we can revitalize o ur cultures an d deco lo n ize o ur lives. In digen o us Peo p les are resp o n din g differen tly an d creatively all o ver the wo rld. I wan t to o ffer two sp ecific ways that we do this wo rk. First o f all, to deco lo n ize o ur min ds, we n eed to embrace a typ e o f trickster co n scio usn ess to break o ut o f the bin ary thin kin g imp o sed o n us by Euro cen tric thin kin g. Cultural arts an d In digen o us lan guages are two o f the best ways to sup p o rt this men tal deco lo n ial p ro cess. But what do I mean by trickster co n scio usn ess? It’s a term co in ed by An ishin aabe scho lar, Gerald Vizen o r, who writes abo ut the imp o rtan ce o f differen t ways o f thin kin g an d ho w to free the min d o f the limits o f the Western in tellectual p aradigm. Trickster co n scio usn ess help s facilitate a p aradigm shift in o ur thin kin g. As Vizen o r articulates, “Trickster co n scio usn ess is a co mic liberato r that craves chan ce, surp rise, differen ce. The trickster is a healer in a fragmen ted wo rld. The trickster den ies sin gularity, mo n o cultures, an d co mp letio n . The trickster is co mmun al, sen suo us, ero tic. The trickster is go in g to help us get us to o ur n ext p lace.”1 An d trickster mediates between sup p o sedly co n tradicto ry fo rces o r elemen ts by retain in g asp ects o f bo th, so methin g that o ur Western p aradigm o ften has a difficult time with. Ojibwe artist Carl Beam has called this p ro cess “trickster shift.”2 Can adian scho lar Allen Ryan exp lain s this mean in g, “What Beam calls the ‘trickster shift’ is p erhap s best un dersto o d as serio us p lay, the ultimate go al o f which is a radical shift in viewer p ersp ective an d even p o litical p o sitio n in g by imagin in g an d imagin g altern ative viewp o in ts.”3 We see in the do min an t Western wo rld that decisio n s are o ften based o n “either/o r” thin kin g—it’s either this o r that, black o r white, Rep ublican o r Demo crat, in o r o ut, fo r us o r again st us. This bin ary thin kin g has so tho ro ughly p ervaded o ur min ds that it has beco me an un co n scio us reflex in tho ught. Histo rically, thro ugh a multip licity o f lan guages an d lifeways, In digen o us Peo p les have ho n o red differen ces in thin kin g an d bein g. The trickster, the co yo te, as an archetyp e, as a p erso n , as a cultural hero in o ur o ral traditio n s an d sto ries, is a teacher an d remin der o f p lurality, diversity, p arado x, humo r, surp rise, an d humility. Trickster fo rces us to retain an un derstan din g o f all sides o f a sto ry by revealin g them to be co existin g p arts o f o n e greater who le—in terco n n ected an d in distin guishable. There are n umero us n ative ceremo n ies, rituals, an d p ractices, such as the ro le o f the Ho p i Clo wn , the Okan agan Fo ur So cieties p ro cess, an d the Lako ta Co n do len ce ceremo n y that en co urage the un derstan din g o f diverse p o in ts o f view. It is tho ught that this flexibility in thin kin g an d the embracin g o f humo r also help s us o verco me p ain an d hardship . On e o f the ways we can in vite this trickster co n scio usn ess o r co yo te way in to o ur lives an d deco lo n ize o ur min ds is thro ugh traditio n al cultural arts: music, dan ce, weavin g, carvin g, beadin g, regalia-makin g, sculp tin g, p ain tin g, an d o ther mediums. By en gagin g the han ds with n atural materials —wo o d, p lan ts, sto n e, p igmen ts, leather—o r en gagin g the min d with so n g, music, an d so n ic imagin atio n , we can disrup t o ur Euro cen tric co n ditio n in g. There is so methin g abo ut the rhythm o f usin g o ur who le bo dies an d o ther p arts o f o ur min ds that o p en s up a mo re fluid way o f kn o win g an d bein g. All artists kn o w that when yo u are “in the gro o ve” o r “in the flo w”—usin g yo ur han ds, bo dies, an d min ds in creative ways—that the trap p in gs o f Cartesian lo gic fall away. We are n o t thin kin g o f the p ast o r co n cern ed with the future. We are p resen t in the mo men t as an in tegral p art o f creatio n . This creative liberatio n is a fo un datio n an d fo rm o f cultural so vereign ty. We are re-in digen izin g o urselves by usin g o ur n ative lan guages, which is n o small feat when a lan guage has been in the o ral traditio n with n o written reco rd, when it was beaten o ut o f yo u in bo ardin g scho o l, when it was fo rbidden by the go vern men t who wo uld withho ld fo o d ratio n s if yo u didn ’t sp eak En glish. The brutal legacy o f co lo n izatio n is felt in every asp ect o f life, an d lan guage is o n e o f the co re p laces where iden tity an d traditio n al ways o f kn o win g sp rin g fro m. Co n seq uen tly, n ative lan guages were targeted by the U.S. go vern men t, which fo cused o n eradicatin g In digen o us lan guages thro ugh assimilatio n p ro grams, in cludin g the in famo us American In dian bo ardin g scho o ls. But even this systematic attemp t at co lo n izin g In digen o us min ds was n o t co mp letely successful. I am just a begin n er in learn in g Oj i b we mowi n, my Ojibwe lan guage, but even the little bit I have learn ed has already shifted my fun damen tal p ercep tio n s o f sp ace an d time, en ergy an d matter, an d the essen ce o f reality. Fo r examp le, in the o lder, mo re advan ced Oijbwemo win there are fo ur p ast ten ses, fo ur p resen t ten ses, an d fo ur future ten ses.

If we wan t to embrace trickster co n scio usn ess an d disrup t co lo n ial p attern s o f tho ught, then we have to learn o ur n ative lan guages, o ur mo ther to n gues.

In Australia they call the yo un g Abo rigin es who were taken to these scho o ls, the “sto len gen eratio n s.” Chickasaw law exp ert James Sakej Hen derso n an d o thers call this gro up the “Sp lit-Head So ciety,” tho se who were taken to bo ardin g scho o l an d assimilated in to Euro -cen tric ways.

In 2 0 0 5 , o ur Cultural Co n servan cy team wen t to the Sherman In dian Bo ardin g Scho o l in Riverside, Califo rn ia, with members o f the So uthern Paiute Natio n . There we p articip ated in an d do cumen ted a healin g ceremo n y as a much n eeded rite o f p assage fo r all o f the children who died there an d n ever wen t ho me. The sin gin g o f the Salt So n gs are a traditio n al way the So uthern Paiute ho n o r their dead, in this case tho se children who didn ’t go back to their ho melan ds an d have a p ro p er ceremo n ial tran sitio n to the n ext wo rld. These Salt So n gs are the sacred so n gs o f the Paiute p eo p le an d they are used at fun erals, memo rials, an d wakes. They are also travelin g so n gs, so me wo uld say that they are similar to the so n glin es o f the Australian abo rigin es in the sen se that they describe bo th p hysical an d metap hysical geo grap hic sites an d p laces o n their cultural lan dscap e. The Salt So n gs travel thro ugh Utah, Nevada, Arizo n a, Califo rn ia, an d alo n g the Co lo rado River. The so n gs also aid in p eo p les’ travel an d serve as o rien tin g devices. When a lo ved o n e dep arts fro m the p hysical wo rld they travel o n a sp iritual jo urn ey; the so n gs describe that jo urn ey o n a sp iritual trail. So these so n gs are healin g fo r the p erso n who p asses o n , but they’re also a healin g fo r the family members who are left behin d. We wen t to the Sherman In dian Bo ardin g Scho o l cemetery an d we were ho n o red to be in vited to p articip ate in an d film the ceremo n y that was held there.

But we still had to debate it an d talk to Elders an d sit in co un cil fo r man y ho urs to wo rk thro ugh the co n cern s. Ultimately, Salt So n g sin gers felt that it was n ecessary to bless these children with the Salt So n gs an d make a visual do cumen t to reco gn ize the truth o f what had hap p en ed there. It was critical to have this in tergen eratio n al healin g ceremo n y fo r tho se children an d their families. Afterward, the sin gers an d family members said they felt like a weight had been lifted fro m them an d tears o f jo y were shared. It is crucial to reco gn ize that bo th Can ada an d Australia have had o fficial truth an d reco n ciliatio n p ro cesses, rep o rts, an d laws p assed that have reco gn ized the ho rrible histo ry o f bo ardin g scho o ls an d their n egative in tergen eratio n al imp act o n the In digen o us p o p ulatio n s.

Un derlyin g the clash between the Euro p ean co lo n iz er ( their descen dan ts in cluded) , an d the In digen o us Peo p les’ cultures, there is the clash o f en tirely differen t wo rldviews, ways o f kn o win g, an d ways o f bein g. Thro ugho ut the last five hun dred years, the co lo n iz ers’ mo dern , mechan istic, p o sten lighten men t, Cartesian wo rldview has p ervaded In digen o us so cieties aro un d the wo rld. First Natio n scho lars Marie Battiste an d James Yo un gblo o d Hen derso n co mmen t, in the fo llo win g way, o n Euro cen trism: “It is the imagin ative an d in stitutio n al co n text that in fo rms co n temp o rary scho larship , o p in io n , an d law. As a theo ry, it p o stulates the sup erio rity o f Euro p ean s o ver n o n -Euro p ean s. It is built o n a set o f assump tio n s an d beliefs that educated an d usually un p rejudiced Euro p ean s an d No rth American s habitually accep t as true. As sup p o rted by the ‘facts,’ o r as ‘reality.’”1 The curren t, glo bal, en viro n men tal, eco lo gical, so cietal, mo ral, an d sp iritual crises in fo rm us abo ut the fun damen tal p ast an d p resen t flaws o f the co lo n iz er’s Euro -American wo rldview. Perhap s this can be exp ressed as the result o f n avigatin g in the widesp read, shallo w, an d, as Karl Marx n o ted, “fro sty waters o f ego tist calculatio n .” So me o f the main characteristics o f this Euro -American wo rldview are that it is an thro p o cen tric an d gro un ded in the Judeo -Christian an d Cartesian co smo visio n . This visio n p laces man abo ve n ature, co n siders the earth as dead an d in ert—so methin g to man ip ulate fro m o utside, an d exp lo itable fo r p ro fits. This Euro -No rth American wo rldview emp hasiz es the imp o rtan ce o f the in dividual: life mo ves aro un d men ’s material n eeds; in n o vatio n is p ro tected by in dividual p ro p erty rights; truth is o n ly p o ssible thro ugh scien ce; o n ly what is tan gible is real; materialism is the o n ly thin g that matters; sp irituality is irrelevan t, an d n ature is an en dless so urce o f reso urces. This ap p ro ach to life is o bvio usly flawed an d fragmen ted. This wo rldview p racticed at ho me, scho o l, an d wo rk is the mo st imp o rtan t facto r in this glo bal crisis. It has been an d p ersists in bein g a recip e fo r disaster. It is the temp late o f un sustain able develo p men t p ractices that have imp acted Mo ther Earth, life as a who le, an d co mmun ities, rural an d urban , all o ver the wo rld in a very ero sive man n er, fo r the last five hun dred years. To day, the co lo n iz er men tality n o t o n ly co n tin ues to threaten an d un dermin e In digen o us Peo p les’ co mmun ities, lan guages, cultures, lan ds, territo ries an d p laces but it threaten s the descen dan ts o f the co lo n iz er as well. Place, in Quechua an d Aymara, is called Pacha, the rep resen tatio n o f the co smo s at the lo cal level. The lo cal Pacha is the fun damen tal base fo r lo n g-term co mmun ities: the co mmun ity o f n ature, the co mmun ity o f human bein gs, an d the co mmun ity o f go ds an d deities. These are the basic elemen ts o f life’s so vereign ty. Water, air, lan d, en ergy, an d the seed are facin g serio us challen ges in their cycles to sustain the regen eratio n o f life. The lo ss o f resp ect fo r life an d its sacredn ess are reflected in the un sustain able typ e o f develo p men t carried o ut by the co lo n iz ers an d n eo co lo n iz ers thro ugho ut the last five hun dred years. What is called fo r is a p aradigm shift, fro m the Euro cen tric p aradigm to In digen o us/eco cen tric o n es. We can resp o n d to that call fo r this tran sitio n by beco min g n atives to this lan d, by re-n ativizin g o urselves. In digen ism ( In digen is mo in Sp an ish) in Latin America is stro n gly asso ciated with assimilatio n . This typ e o f p o licy has been p ro p o sed by the state an d a co n sp icuo us gro up o f urban middle-class in tellectuals—so me o f them Marxists. In the co n text o f Latin American co lo n iz ed erudite in tellectuals, the term “re-in digen iz atio n ” can easily be in terp reted as p art o f a p ro cess o f n eo -in digen ism, in the same way that p ro cesses o f cultural affirmatio n an d deco lo n iz atio n in the An dean -Amaz o n ian regio n o f Peru have been termed “Neo -n aro dn ism” o r “Neo -camp esin ismo ” o r “Neo /re- p easan tiz atio n ” o r simp ly “a return to the p ast.” Such facile, fan cy co n cep tualiz atio n s are, in fact, to be un dersto o d as misin terp retatio n s stemmin g fro m Euro cen tric, p o sitivistic discip lin es. They are p ro n o un ced by very discip lin ed scho lars who are mo re than ready to fo rcefully adap t reality to their n o n -In digen o us ap p ro aches, resp o n din g to their o wn in terests in self-servin g ways. In the en d, they serve the n eeds o f their discip lin es, n o t the n eeds o f co mmun ities. I wo uld like to suggest so me ideas in regard to the issue o f rein digen iz atio n /re-n ativiz atio n o r beco min g n ative to this lan d an d its relatio n to the deco lo n iz atio n o f lan d-territo ry-bo dy-min d-sp irituality. The p ro p o sitio n mean s differen t thin gs to differen t p eo p le. We have differen t sto ries, differen t histo ries—p reco lo n ial, co lo n ial, an d n eo co lo n ial— differen t exp erien ces, differen t p asts, differen t p resen ts, an d differen t futures. The situatio n in vo lves differen t agen das but rein digen iz atio n /re- n ativiz atio n is critically imp o rtan t fo r p eo p les in the No rth an d fo r p eo p les in the So uth, as well as fo r n ative p eo p les fro m the Americas, an d ultimately fo r all the p eo p les o f this earth. Sacredn ess, recip ro city, n urturin g, an d resp ect are key co n cep ts embedded in an cien t In digen o us Peo p les’ wo rldviews. They are the p illars in p ro curin g dialo gue an d balan ce amo n g all the co mmun ities: n ature, human bein gs, an d deities/go ds. This is an un dervalued curren cy in mo dern so cieties aro un d the glo be. Two serio us issues facin g the In digen o us wo rld are due to develo p men t an d its in satiable exp lo itatio n o f n ature where scarcity beco mes the rule an d the p o llutio n o f the basic elemen ts o f life are a direct co n seq uen ce. The seco n d majo r issue is In digen o us lan guage ero sio n an d/o r disap p earan ce. This is a p erman en t threat to In digen o us ways o f kn o win g. Thro ugh lan guage we n o t o n ly exp ress o ur view o f the wo rld; lan guage co n n ects us deep ly with the wo r ld, with “all my ( o ur) relatio n s.” Place an d lan guage revitaliz atio n as p art o f a p ro cess o f cultural affirmatio n an d deco lo n iz atio n is cen tral. Man y In digen o us co mmun ities an d in dividuals are rap idly lo sin g their lan guages. I have exp erien ced lo sin g the lan guage o f my mo ther, the Aymara lan guage. This, in the ( n eo ) co lo n iz er’s do min an t Euro cen tric view, is p art o f a n o -return p ro cess o f hybridity, assimilatio n , a dilutio n o f iden tity. In the ( n eo ) co lo n iz er’s p o in t o f view this way is a p o sitive sign al o f mo dern iz atio n : acculturatio n is to beco me who yo u are n o t. In the p ast, the co n scio us effo rts o f the co lo n iz er to marry n ative wo men fro m the n ative elites to co lo n iz ers was n o t based o n sexual attractio n o r lo ve n ecessarily; it was also p art o f a hun gry an d self-in terested strategy to secure p o wer an d co n tro l o f reso urces. Of co urse, sexual vio len ce to o k p lace, in the p ast an d even to day. The racist Euro -cen tric n o men clature fo r this gen etic mixture an d o utco me in the Americas was an d still is: the mixed-blo o d, half-breed, the Mestiz o , the Mé tis, the cho lo , the ladin o . In the co n text o f Peru, it mean s n i chicha, n i limo n ada ( wishywashy) . The p arado x is that the co lo n iz er co in ed the term mes tizo but n ever used it in Euro p e. Desp ite the great histo rical mixture o f races that has taken p lace an d still do es, n o bo dy in Euro p e, in p articular in Sp ain , calls him o r herself Mestiz o . An d there are stro n g reaso n s, as Native American scho lar Jack Fo rbes has n o ted a lo n g time ago , fo r the Euro p ean p eo p le to day to call themselves Mestiz o s.2 The racist term mestiz o , has dismembered the iden tity, ho p efully temp o rarily, o f a vast secto r o f Latin American p eo p le. Due to in sidio us racism—subtle/veiled/un veiled—to day this secto r do es n o t ackn o wledge an d/o r claim their In digen o us backgro un d, much less the wo rldview an d lan guages asso ciated with it. To day, as well as durin g the co lo n ial p ast, bein g In dian o r havin g an In dian backgro un d is a stain ; fo r that reaso n man y in Latin America feel fo rced to fo rget their In digen o us backgro un d o r call themselves “p easan ts.” Bein g In dian in Latin America is eq uated with bein g p rimitive, ign o ran t, reluctan t to chan ge,an d basically stup id. It is so methin gvery bad. Fo r thatreaso n man y p eo p le in So uth America p refer to p ut their In dian An dean -Amaz o n ian an cesto rs “un der the carp et.” These racist p ro cesses, ho wever, are n o w go in g in to retreat due to the n ew develo p men t in re-ethn iciz atio n . Reethn iciz atio n simp ly mean s to ackn o wledge o ur an cesto rs, o ur iden tity, where we co me fro m, an d what o ur deep est ro o ts are. It is to re-en gage with an In digen o us-eco cen tric wo rldview.

Thus, in the best-case scen ario , they wo uld beco me mo dern . In the wo rse case scen ario In dian s wo uld simp ly van ish. The fact is, ho wever, that the In digen o us p o p ulatio n has n o t disap p eared. It is gro win g.

We’re lo cated o n the win dward side o f the islan d o f Oahu. A lo ha ’A in a is an o ld term in Hawaiian . It mean s “to lo ve that which n o urishes yo u.” ’A in a in Hawaiian mean s lan d. The reaso n we n amed it that is because we feel the lan d an d o ur en viro n men t gives us all that we n eed to sustain o urselves. The p ro blems that we’re facin g are p ro blems that [p eo p le] are facin g all o ver the wo rld. These p ro jects that we’re bein g in tro duced to [at Bio n eers] an d even o ur p ro jects in Hawaii give us ho p e fo r a better future, an d we n eed this to mo ve fo rward. An o ther thin g that really sticks in my min d is the webbin g o f the co mmun ity—p eo p le startin g with the sp iritual revitalizatio n o f themselves, their co mmun ities, an d their families. We are facin g so me challen ges to day an d if we do n ’t deal with them n o w, o ur children are defin itely go in g to be facin g these challen ges. It’s best we start p rep arin g fo r them. Kalo [taro p lan t] is the main stap le o f the Hawaiian p eo p le. As we face the lo ss o f o ur agricultural lan d in Hawaii, a big p art o f the culture is bein g taken away. The health o f the p eo p le is declin in g, o ur water is beco min g co n tamin ated, an d can cer is o n the rise. Hawaii is o n e o f the leadin g states fo r p ro state an d co lo n can cer in men . Fo r wo men , we’re o n e o f the leadin g states fo r breast can cer. These p ro blems co n tin ue to rise, as well as ADD an d autism. We kn o w that bein g taken away fro m the traditio n al diet is a big p art o f this p ro blem, an d bein g taken away fro m the lan d to gro w this fo o d is really the so urce o f the p ro blem. Part o f the sp iritual revitalizatio n starts with o ur co n n ectio n back to the lan d; that’s ho w we sp iritually revive o urselves. We brin g a lo t o f the kids an d families to the wetlan d terraces that are up in the back o f Maun awill Valley. They ran ge an ywhere fro m five hun dred to o n e tho usan d years o ld. We’ve reo p en ed an o ld archaeo lo gical co mp lex that had been aban do n ed fo r hun dreds o f years an d was in an area o f agriculture that is in q uestio n right n o w. I am p art o f a co -o p o f ban an a farmers an d that’s ho w we were fo rtun ate to get in to this valley. When we came in to it, we p rayed, talked to the Kup un a (Elders), an d we decided to reo p en the taro p atches that were o n these ban an a lan ds. On e o f the thin gs we are facin g in this valley, is that the State has req uired that we o n ly gro w ban an as o n these lan ds, so this was an issue that we had to really p ray up o n an d fin d guidan ce abo ut with regard to the right time to make the mo ve o n to the lan d an d ho w to do it. Fo rtun ately, we’ve been able to resto re aro un d twen ty-six taro p atches in this area. The valley is lo aded with taro p atches, which is a sign o f ho w man y p eo p le this lan d used to sustain at o n e time. There are sp rin gs co min g o ut o f the valley, o ut o f the ro cks, that feed these taro p atches. I can ’t say en o ugh abo ut this p lan t. Reco n n ectin g to the lan d an d to this p lan t has chan ged my life. It’s really this sp iritual an d p hysical n o urishmen t that p eo p le n eed in Hawaii. Three gen eratio n s o f p eo p le are o n the lan d. That is o ur fo cus right n o w an d it really starts with co mmun ity an d family, tryin g to reach o ut to families, brin g them back to the lan d, let them reco n n ect to the lan d an d the culture, an d let the lan d in sp ire in them in what they n eed to do . It’s very healin g an d bo n din g fo r the p aren ts an d their children . Access to these kin ds o f lan ds is very hard. There are n o t a who le lo t o f taro farmers left in Hawaii. Our access to the mo un tain s, o ur access to gatherin g fo o ds an d medicin es, is bein g taken away very q uickly. The average co st o f a sin gle-family ho me in Hawaii right n o w is $6 0 0 ,0 0 0 . This is frighten in g fo r me because I have five children , an d I just can ’t even fatho m ho w we’re go in g to be fo rced to live in a system to even survive o n o ur o wn lan ds in Hawaii. An acre o f agricultural lan d is go in g fo r aro un d $8 0 ,0 0 0 . That is a lo w-en d p rice n o w. We are tryin g to reach o ut to the co mmun ity an d brin g back awaren ess, n o t o n ly to the Hawaiian co mmun ity, but to all the p eo p le who are livin g within o ur co mmun ity. We n eed to live an d wo rk to gether, an d we n eed to p reserve o ur reso urces fo r future gen eratio n s. Yo u’re go in g to hear the wo rd ahup ua’a thro ugho ut all o f o ur sto ries. It is a divisio n o f lan d that run s fro m the mo un tain to the o cean , an d within this area are all o ur reso urces—fo o d, shelter, water, clo thin g, an d medicin e. It’s a man agemen t system o f these reso urces. Each family that lives within each o f these ahup ua’a has a resp o n sibility to main tain this ahup ua’a. We’re tryin g to reach o ut to the families an d help them to un derstan d that we n eed their help . We try to tie health in to everythin g. Everybo dy’s smilin g in the taro p atch. It’s a wo n derful thin g. The kids lo ve to get in to the taro p atches an d in to the mud. It’s very healin g an d reco n n ectin g. Yo u can eat the taro p lan t fro m the to p to the bo tto m. Yo u can eat the leaf, which is high in calcium, like a dark, leafy green ; yo u can eat the stem. They are fin din g medicin al p ro p erties that aid in digestio n , so I’ve heard that p harmaceutical co mp an ies are actually cap sulizin g it an d usin g it as an aid fo r digestio n . Then , o f co urse, taro is a starch. Bein g that we’re in Hawaii, in such an iso lated p lace, aro un d 8 0 p ercen t o f o ur fo o d is imp o rted an d access to healthy fo o d is very hard. There are a few health sto res o n the islan d o f Oahu, maybe a han dful, but yo u rarely see lo cal p eo p le go in g in to these p laces. The access to healthy fo o ds is almo st imp o ssible, an d then we’re fo rced to eat a diet that’s n o t o f o ur gen etics. Our go al is to educate an d brin g awaren ess to these lan ds, an d while we’re cultivatin g an d revitalizin g these lan ds, we’re p uttin g them in to p ro tectio n . We really have to educate aro un d that fo o d p ro ductio n an d make these fo o ds available. We p artn er with so me very family-o rien ted scho o ls. We wo rk with fo ster families an d issues o f drug an d alco ho l addictio n an d the same thin g hap p en s every time: when they’re able to make this reco n n ectio n back to the lan d, yo u see their sp irits so ften an d their hearts so ften , an d they’re able to be recep tive to thin gs that are bein g to ld to them thro ugh the lan d to heal themselves an d heal their family. We’re p artn erin g with several o rgan izatio n s who se go al is to save an d p reserve the sacred sites an d also to revitalize an d resto re these fo o d p ro ductio n areas, an d to be eco lo gical stewards o f o ur ahup ua’a. We fin d that reachin g the child isn ’t the o n ly way. It has to be a ho listic an d who le family mo vemen t. These traditio n s that were held within the ahup ua’a were mo rals, values, an d traditio n s that held the family to gether. We n eed tho se values to day. On e o f the thin gs we’re facin g n o w wo rkin g with the yo uth is that families are bro ken . They’re facin g so man y p ro blems that the mo ther is so metimes n o lo n ger the caregiver. Bo th o f the p aren ts are o ut o f the ho use, the children are ro amin g free an d gettin g in vo lved in thin gs that they sho uldn ’t get in vo lved in . Ice (methamp hetamin e) is an ep idemic o n o ur islan d right n o w an d it’s devastatin g families. I’m a reco vered ice addict, co cain e addict, an d alco ho lic. The lan d was a majo r healin g p art in my life, an d I kn o w that the lan d can heal. I kn o w that the lan d p ro vides if we can o n ly listen an d give back what it asks fo r. Traditio n al farmin g is o rgan ic farmin g, an d that is give an d take. Yo u do n ’t take, take, take an d dep lete an d dep lete, where n o bo dy will have it after yo u. This is the men tality that we have to get in to to make sure that o ur children are go in g to have so methin g in the future. In o ur co mmun ity, ho uses are sellin g fo r o ver a millio n do llars. My p aren ts mo ved in to Kailua an d they bo ught their ho use fo r $7 0 ,0 0 0 . These ho uses n o w are go in g fo r $5 0 0 ,0 0 0 –$8 0 0 ,0 0 0 . Ho uses alo n g the o cean where o ur access used to be o p en —we co uld go camp do wn at the o cean , make bo n fires, fish—we n o lo n ger have that right an ymo re. Our access to the o cean is n arro w strip s, an d we’re n o t blamin g the p eo p le, but we n eed to so ften their hearts in so me way. We n eed to fin d a way. On e o f the ways is also brin gin g them an d givin g them a cultural exp erien ce an d lettin g them see what we’re talkin g abo ut, that this is so methin g that can help everybo dy. In digen o us Kn o wledge is key. Scien ce is a big p art o f it, but the In digen o us Kn o wledge is so methin g that’s been p assed o n fro m gen eratio n to gen eratio n . There’s so much that we can learn fro m it. It so ften s my heart to see children in the taro p atch with big smiles. It’s sad, so metimes, that we have Native Hawaiian children co me to the taro p atches, maybe sen io rs in high scho o l, an d they’ve n ever been in a taro p atch befo re, n ever been in a stream an d caught the little marin e life that’s in the stream. Sto rytellin g hap p en s when kids co me to the lan d. The gen ealo gy go es directly back to the kalo p lan t. There’s aro un d 2 2 6 acres in o ur co -o p erative o f farmers an d there are fo ur farmers actively farmin g right n o w. The rest have faded o ut. This is a situatio n we’re dealin g with n o w, to revitalize o ur co -o p erative o f farmers. In the valley that I’m farmin g in , which is un der a state lease, if o ur o rgan izatio n o r o ur co -o p wan ted to deal with the state o n ren ego tiatin g o ur leases, o ur lease lan ds wo uld go to o p en -auctio n bid. The head o f the DNLR, the Dep artmen t o f Natural Lan d an d Reso urces, already to ld us that yo u wo uld n o t see an y Hawaiian s in that valley if this were to go back to the state. The highest bidder wo uld co me in an d they wo uld get co n tro l o f that valley. This is hap p en in g all acro ss the state o f Hawaii. Fo reign ers are co min g in an d buyin g up who le ahup ua’a. They’re turn in g them in to millio n do llar ho uses. They’re n o t farmin g these lan ds like they were mean t to be. We’re wo rkin g with o ther o rgan izatio n s to try an d get o ur fo o d back in to the scho o ls, which is very imp o rtan t. It’s un fo rtun ate that we’re fin din g the yo uth lo sin g their taste fo r o ur traditio n al fo o ds, which is go in g to be a p ro blem. We n eed to give them these fo o ds so that they un derstan d. When we came to this lan d, it was all trees an d bushes. This really is where my heart is—to reach o ut to the families, reco n n ect them, help them, an d wo rk to gether with them in resto rin g these p laces. My children are the mo tivato rs drivin g me, because I kn o w that if my wife an d I do n ’t make these chan ges an d we wait fo r o ther p eo p le to make these chan ges, we’re go in g to be so rry. It’s fo r the future gen eratio n s, o ur kids, an d o ur gran dkids. If we do n ’t do so methin g n o w, we’ll be watchin g fro m the o ther side an d we wo n ’t be hap p y with what’s hap p en in g. Eric Enos: Alo ha. The faster we beco me citizen s o f the wo rld, the better this wo rld will be. On e thin g that really makes me so rt o f sad is when I see p eo p le say, Go d Bless America. I thin k why o n ly America? Go d lo ves everybo dy an d we sho uld see everybo dy as aun tie, every p erso n as un cle, every p erso n as gran dmo ther, every p erso n as gran dfather, an d every child yo u see sho uld be o ur child, to o . That’s a resp o n sibility we have to the wo rld, the wo rld citizen ship . We truly believe, as In digen o us Peo p les, that everyo n e is In digen o us. We all co me fro m the earth. We all share her breath an d her life. Where I am fro m, we’re in the back o f the valley o f Wai’an ae o n the islan d o f Oahu. The idea o f Hawaii bein g fo r so meo n e else is the reality that we are facin g. All o f the p eo p le I wo rk with do n o t have a chan ce to live in their o wn ho melan d. Native p eo p le in Hawaii have very few chan ces. The o n ly chan ces they have are these reservatio n s called Dep artmen t o f Hawaiian Ho melan ds, an d they’re just like the reservatio n s in the Un ited States. They are the lan ds that n o bo dy wan ted. We can take tho se lan ds an d we can still reaffirm o ur values, but it’s a struggle every sin gle day. We all came fro m the sea. If so meo n e were to say, what is a Hawaiian , I wo uld begin with the o cean an d the thin gs that clin g to the ro ck that co me o ut o f the o cean itself. Because in all o ur cultures a Hawaiian was n o t a p erso n that walked with two feet—it’s the win d, the rain , the clo uds, the an imals, the p lan ts. Tho se were o ur first an cesto rs. What’s really in terestin g is that all In digen o us Peo p les un derstan d this—that o ur creatio n came fro m the turn in g o f the heaven s. In o ur creatio n chan ts we talk abo ut that: the begin n in g o f life was the swirlin g an d the turn in g an d the mo vemen t o f the un iverse itself. Then it talks abo ut the sea. It to ld us that these are the thin gs that we came fro m, an d that human bein gs are way, way, way do wn the lin e. Befo re that it was all these thin gs that n ature gave us. Our co mmun ity is a very rural, dry co mmun ity. I can tell yo u a sto ry abo ut when all o f o ur valleys were taken away. Eighty p ercen t o f o ur p eo p le en ded up as “sq uatters” o n the o utskirts o f Ho n o lulu. We were all up ro o ted fro m o ur lan ds, an d that’s o ur histo ry. It’s the same histo ry that yo u all kn o w, yo u’ve heard the sto ry, but it hap p en ed in Hawaii also —the illegal o verthro w o f Hawaii by U.S. fo rces. We wen t up in to the o n ly valley o n the co ast o f Wai’an ae. Man y magn ificen t valleys are o wn ed by the military o r p rivate lan do wn ers. We have n o access to o ur mo un tain s o r watersheds. The o n ly p laces we have are little strip s alo n g the o cean . We’ve had n o iden tity to the mo un tain s fo r the last three gen eratio n s. We o n ly go t in to this lan d thro ugh a fluke because state lan ds an d leases are p o litical p lums o f tho se that sup p o rted the go vern men t leadership . On e o f the p o litical leaders in the co mmun ity wen t to jail, so his lease to this lan d was up fo r grabs. Un der the mo del cities p ro gram, Lyn do n Jo hn so n ’s great war o n p o verty, co mmun ity actio n an d legal aid p ro grams came abo ut, but the so cial p ro grams came o ut o f the burn in g o f Watts. The co un try said, Who a, we n eed to start p ayin g atten tio n to what’s hap p en in g to the in n er cities. At this time, the co mmun ity was o rgan ized an d they had a n o n p ro fit bo ard that co uld go after this lease, an d they go t it. The lan ded gen try in o ur co mmun ity were very up set abo ut this. I was with a yo uth p ro gram an d we wen t up in to the valley an d fo un d n o water. As we walked o n the lan d, we cleared the trees o n it an d fo un d that these were aban do n ed taro terraces. We lo o ked at these thin gs an d tried to figure o ut ho w to get them back. We were lo o kin g at the lan d an d clearin g it with the yo uth p ro grams, but we n eeded water. Abo ut a mile up in to the valley, there is a p lace where they p lan ted sugar p lan tatio n s at the turn o f the cen tury, dammed the streams, an d to o k the water o ut o f the valley fo r sugar. We wen t up there in the exact p lace where they had dammed it, an d there was a little bit o f surface run n in g water. I tried to get p ermissio n to use this surface run o ff water fo r o ur p ro ject, an d I fo un d o ut ho w man y differen t ways go vern men t can say n o . In the summer o f 1 9 7 8 , we said yes, an d we did it. This was an illegal act. On e co co n sp irato r was the mayo r o f the summer yo uth p ro gram. On e was a so cial agen cy in o ur co mmun ity that stuck o ut its n eck to help us get a little lo an so we co uld buy two -in ch PVC p ip e. An o ther co co n sp irato r was a Un iversity o f Hawaii waste systems en gin eer who sho wed us ho w to stick this p ip e in to the aban do n ed sugar can e ditch, p ut in a little dam an d a screen an d brin g the water do wn . We bro ught it do wn durin g the summer. I kn ew n o thin g abo ut taro . I wen t to a p rivate scho o l fo r Hawaiian s— o n e o f the richest scho o ls in the co un try. We ate o ur traditio n al fo o d o n e day a year. I kn ew n o thin g abo ut Hawaiian histo ry. The who le p urp o se o f that scho o l, an d it was all do n e with the best o f in ten tio n s, was to make go o d, in dustrio us white men an d wo men o ut o f Hawaiian s. I do n ’t thin k these p eo p le had evil in ten tio n s, they just felt that everybo dy n eeded to be like them. We said, well, maybe we n eed to lo o k at what’s p o sitive abo ut o ur culture. We learn ed abo ut taro an d I learn ed ho w to gro w taro fro m Russian s in Wai’aho le—they’re wo n derful p eo p le, they bro ught the state to the Sup reme Co urt in water rights—but it’s really curio us where we learn , where the kn o wledge co mes fro m, because a lo t o f o ur kn o wledge was lo st, but n o t to tally. I thin k there are First Natio n sto ries o f a fragmen t o f their an cesto r, an d that fragmen t, that little bo n e, bro ught back life again to that p erso n . There are very p o etic chan ts that talk abo ut where water is fo un d. There’s such beauty in the thin kin g o f p eo p le who have wo rked with the lan d an d the water fo r tho usan ds o f years, an d their sto ries, their myths, are in the so n gs an d the chan ts. The p o etry in these so n gs is in credible, p o werful p o etry. The co lo r o f o ur lan d up there has chan ged. When yo u first wen t up there, it was dry, barren , bro wn , yello w, an d it’s just thro ugh brin gin g this water do wn that it turn ed green , a beautiful green , an d life came back. This is where we reco n n ected with o ur Elders; we reco n n ected again st tremen do us o dds. We are brin gin g back the traditio n al fishin g can o es. All o f these excitin g thin gs are abo ut the healthy watershed, fro m the rain -fed mo un tain s o ut in to the deep est, bluest p art o f the sea, an d it has to be healthy. We’re develo p in g curricula in the scho o ls, takin g In digen o us Kn o wledge an d matchin g it up with the Dep artmen t o f Educatio n stan dards. Peo p le do n o t have access to healthy fo o d. If yo u go to families in the markets an d check o ut what they’re buyin g, it’s can n ed go o ds, can n ed so da. We are gro win g o ur o wn fish n o w in o ur p ro grams with a hatchery in o ur co mmun ity. Public ho usin g is an o ther reality in Hawaii, the p o o r man ’s Hilto n . There is n o p lace to farm o r fish, but p len ty o f p laces to buy drugs. It’s lo aded. The meth ep idemic in Hawaii is in credible. Lualualei, the largest valley in the state o f Hawaii, is a n aval ammun itio n sto rage facility. On e reso rt o ffers artificial reefs, the best fishin g gro un ds with n o p ublic access. It’s lan d fo r the wealthy, an d all o ur co mmun ities are bein g faced with this. Ho melessn ess is an o ther issue. Ho w are we go in g to go back to o ur o wn co mmun ities an d build co mmun ities aro un d these values, values that we all share as un cle, as aun tie? Because when we lo o k at so mebo dy, we lo o k fo r family an d brin gin g p eo p le in to the family, because racism is a to o l that they’ve used again st us to divide us. An d the idea is o n e wo rld, o n e n atio n . We gathered p eo p le in the valleys an d talked abo ut the cultural sites. We are reviewin g the p ro cess o f co mmun ity o rgan izin g, an d we are do in g that kin d o f cultural archaeo lo gy so we can learn ho w to tran sfo rm these sites. We wan t to achieve refo restatio n in the mo un tain s, brin g back the traditio n al fo o ds, brin g back the cultural an cho rs, an d brin g back a co n n ectio n to yo uth, in p art by creatin g p ro grams in the scho o ls to help us achieve these aims. Nalani Minton: As “Hawaiian p eo p le,” we are a Pacific Islan d p eo p le. We’re the Mao li o f Hawaii. We’re related to the Mao hi o f Tahiti an d to the Mao ri o f Ao tearo a o r what’s called New Zealan d in co lo n ial terms. When I came ho me fro m co llege, I sp en t abo ut ten years livin g with Kup un a in differen t valleys o n differen t islan ds learn in g o ur medicin e an d healin g traditio n s. Fo r the n ext fifteen years, I was in vo lved with the vo yagin g can o e Ho kule’a, that reco n n ected us to differen t p arts o f the Pacific an d to o ur Pacific iden tity. Our culture is an an tido te to a lo t o f the duality o f livin g in fo reign er-co n tro lled, co n temp o rary life. Our culture has help ed us to fin d o ur sp iritual iden tity in the face o f man y p ro blems, in cludin g the huge p o p ulatio n co llap se o f o ur p eo p le an d man y o f the disp arities that we all still live with. We are tryin g to remedy this by p lan tin g the seed in each gen eratio n to go to the so urce o f life itself, an d to learn to p ro tect tho se n atural relatio n ship s that allo w us to be self- determin ed p eo p le. As Kan aka Mao li we believe n o t o n ly in self-mastery o f all the thin gs we n eed to kn o w to survive an d help o ur families an d co mmun ity an d culture survive, we believe in bein g self-co rrectin g. We wo rk in the n atural ahup ua’a settin gs, where yo u have the clo ud zo n es where the mo isture co mes an d the high fo rests that brin g that mo isture do wn to an elevatio n where yo u can cultivate yo ur fo o d an d all the thin gs that yo u n eed. We have the kahakai, the sho relin e area, which is so rich with all differen t kin ds o f life, an d o n o ut beyo n d the fish p o n ds in to the deep est o cean . That is a mo del o f p eace, because each area itself has all that is n eeded to sustain life. We have to lo o k at the n atural systems that p redate the mo n etary an d co lo n ial systems imp o sed o n earth an d the p eo p les o f the earth fo r the p ast co up le o f tho usan d years. Ho w did p eo p le live when they were relatin g to the co smic n ature o f life, to the mo vemen t o f stars an d the ability to be who le bein gs? In the lo n g vo yagin g can o es, we felt differen t p arts o f o urselves co me alive an d in tegrate. We hadn ’t felt that fo r a lo n g time, because we hadn ’t vo yaged fo r a lo n g time.

That n ature is within us as well. We say as Mao li, Mao hi, an d Mao ri, we’re gen etically related in relatio n ship s as families, where the so ul is p laced in the bo dy, the three p iko : the p iko at the to p o f o ur heads that co n n ects us with o ur an cesto rs an d the co smo s; the umbilical p iko that co n n ects us with o ur mo ther, o ur family an d the earth; an d the gen ital p iko o f creatio n that co n n ects us with o ur children , the future, an d future gen eratio n s.

But there was also a level o f relan guagin g that came fro m In digen o us cultures, where the co llective memo ry is much, much lo n ger than the last few decades o r even the last co up le o f tho usan d years. That is the p art that ren ewed a sen se in me o f who we really are as In digen o us Peo p les, as who le bein gs in the un iverse—there is this co n n ectio n to everythin g as family. When we say that we’re related to all life fo rms as family, p art o f what we mean by that is kin o lau. As Kan aka Mao li, we believe that when we leave the bo dy at “death” o r at a tran sitio n p erio d, that o ur sp irit can take an y fo rm. In Hawaii we believe that the lo ve o f the lan d o f Hawaii itself is so stro n g that we n ever leave, that there are layers o f an cesto rs who are aro un d us who we can call up o n o r who we can reco gn ize an d who se man a we can co n n ect with fo r p ro tectio n an d sup p o rt. On e o f my co usin s in Hawaii is a n o n in strumen tal, n avigato r, Nain o a. He has train ed o ver a hun dred n avigato rs in the last twen ty-five years durin g the time o f the lo n g can o e vo yages. On e o f the thin gs he n o ticed was that the in fo rmatio n in the sky was tellin g him a who le sto ry abo ut ho w to p lace o urselves within the right star lin e so that the lan d we are seekin g in a can o e actually co mes to us, to o . We are co n n ected by that star lin e because we’re un der the same star lin e an d when we mo ve to ward each o ther, we will meet. His teacher Mau fro m Satawal, taught him in silen ce fo r the first year, guidin g him to co n n ect with his o wn p erso n al, co smic relatio n ship with the un iverse. On ce co n n ected, the un iverse co n tin ued to teach him thro ugh his o wn o bservatio n s an d co n temp o rary, p ractical, an d sp iritual exp erien ces. In the an cien t wo rld, there are man y, man y sto ries o f the sp iritual guidan ce o f p eo p le by bein g co mp letely co n n ected. This idea o f bein g related to all life-fo rms as family is n o t a fan tasy to us. There is o n e p ervadin g co n scio usn ess that un ites an d co n n ects us all, an d that’s because o ur an cesto rs sp iritually take differen t fo rms o f life to reco n n ect with us. In truth, we really are related to all life fo rms as family. Part o f o ur sp iritual p rep aratio n as Kan aka Mao li is as an cesto rs. It’s the challen ge that all o f us face who are alive o n earth to day. Ho w do we p rep are to be the an cesto rs o f future p eo p le? Ho w do we make the decisio n s that carry the co n scio usn ess to have clean water fo r future gen eratio n s, to p ut in to p lace all o f the n ecessary thin gs fo r survival that are n eeded an d that were given to o ur gen eratio n to best help us survive? On a sp iritual level, we believe that the awaken in g that’s hap p en in g all o ver the wo rld to day is sho win g us a greater p o wer. Even tho ugh we’ve been p ushed to the limit an d almo st to extin ctio n an d man y sp ecies have, in fact, beco me extin ct, we see ho w these even ts—as we saw in times o f n atural disasters like the In do n esian tidal waves an d hurrican e Katrin a— en liven the cap acity o f go o dn ess in p eo p le to co n n ect with each o ther an d co llectively to realize a much greater p o wer. The revitalizatio n o f Kan aka Mao li culture is very p ro fo un dly p art o f the effect o f chan ge an d tran sfo rmatio n in my life. I made five films o n ahup ua’a kn o wledge an d sadly, man y o f the films do cumen t p laces that do n ’t exist an ymo re. The last film I made is a film with kup un a Jo hn Ka’imikaua, called A Mau A Mau, which mean s to co n tin ue fo rever. Our Elders teach us to lo o k beyo n d the demo cracy o f majo rity rule, because in o ur an cien t traditio n s, we had co un cils o f p eo p le who rep resen ted every area o f sp iritual an d cultural life. The p rin cip le o f the decisio n s that are made by ’aha co un cils is that the p eo p le who have to live with tho se decisio n s must be p art o f makin g the decisio n s. There are o ver seven tho usan d lan guages with p eo p les who sp eak them livin g o n earth . . . why then sho uld o n ly the G8 sup erp o wers make the decisio n s o f eco n o mic glo balizatio n /go bble-izatio n o ver p ro p erty, o wn ership , co n tro l, exp lo itatio n , an d war—decisio n s that the rest o f us must live with?

A lo t o f the time o ur culture is co mmercialized an d seems to exist o n ly as the music o r the backgro un d fo r to urism. But this p art o f the film A Mau A Mau p resen ts a ceremo n y that has to do with Kan aka Mao li exp ressin g o ur co n n ectio n to life; o ur deep gratitude an d p ro fo un d reco gn itio n o f all that is given to us as co smic p eo p le who awake in whatever time we live in , to co n scio usly co mmun icate with the co smo s an d to un derstan d what are the right ways to heal o urselves an d the earth.

This discussio n to o k p lace at the Bio n eers Co n feren ce in 2 0 0 5 . 33 The Powe r of Be ing a Huma n Be ing John Trudell I’m n o t sure if I thin k o f thin gs in terms o f Origin al In structio n s, I just kn o w that there’s the o rigin al kn o wledge. I’m a p art o f that n ative co mmun ity that’s been in vo lved in the relo catio n p ro cess. On my reservatio n we were bein g p un ished fo r thin gs that hap p en ed in Min n eso ta in the 1 8 6 0 s.*1 6 We had o ur ceremo n ies sup p ressed an d all o f the Christian church in fo rmatio n imp o sed up o n us. We were taken fro m o ur lan d an d iso lated in the in dustrial train in g scho o ls, the bo ardin g scho o ls. By the time I came aro un d an d my gen eratio n came aro un d, the ceremo n ies weren ’t there an ymo re an d the lan guage was kep t amo n gst the o ld because they were afraid to p ass it o n because o f what had hap p en ed to them. Yet in terms o f traditio n s, the Elders to ld me what they to ld me an d I learn ed fro m them what I learn ed fro m them. On ce I became taller an d had to take resp o n sibility fo r bein g o ut o n my o wn , I tho ught, well, do I wan t to go back an d learn my lan guage, do I wan t to go fin d this traditio n the way that everybo dy p erceives we’re sup p o sed to be? I tho ught, n o , there’s a reaso n fo r my gen eratio n , there’s a reaso n we are here. There’s a reaso n we are who we are. An d a p art o f that reaso n is that yo u can lo o k at what’s lo st an d yo u can lo o k at what’s here, an d I tho ught, well, maybe o n e o f the reaso n s fo r o ur gen eratio n is that we are an in terp retive gen eratio n . We un derstan d the p redato r min dset better; each gen eratio n un derstan ds it better than the p revio us gen eratio n . I lo o ked at the lan guage an d I decided that I was n o t go in g to go back an d learn my lan guage. I’m go in g to use this o n e, En glish. I’ll use it as my act o f reven ge fo r fuckin ’ teachin g it to me in the first p lace! See, to me, tha t’s “traditio n al”—to take an d use the reso urce that’s there, because that’s the way it is. Yo u use the reso urce that’s there. I rely o n the an cien t kn o wledge because when I lo o k at traditio n , after havin g the exp erien ces I’ve had, I un derstan d that they can take the ceremo n ies away an d they can take the rituals away an d they can take certain thin gs away, but traditio n is based up o n resp ect. So meho w, tho ugh, in the brutalizatio n an d the trauma o f gen o cide, we lo se that p ersp ective. We see so man y thin gs that are bein g taken fro m us an d this creates all o f the traumas. Fro m the very begin n in g, I had to go back an d un derstan d the o rigin al kn o wledge. To me this is the fact that we’re all human bein gs. Every o n e o f us, we are the descen dan ts o f a tribe. Every o n e o f us has a tribal an cestry an d we have a gen etic memo ry. En co ded in that gen etic memo ry is the exp erien ce o f o ur in dividual an d co llective evo lutio n . Yo u can fo llo w it thro ugh the an cestry. The in fo rmatio n is there, because we’re human bein gs —the kn o wledge o f all tho se exp erien ces are with us. The human is temp o rary but bein g just is. Bein g is bein g. So it’s like we’re o n an e-ticket ride to Disn eylan d. It’s a terrible ride, but we’re o n the ride, in the human fo rm. But when the ride’s o ver, we go back to bein g. It’s n o t really abo ut the ride because everythin g is abo ut en ergy. As bein gs, we are en ergy; we are sp irits in the fo rm o f human s. In the an cestral gen etic memo ry we un dersto o d that this is a sp iritual reality that we’re in . It’s n o t a p hysical reality, it is a sp iritual reality because it’s the reality o f bein g, with p hysical thin gs in it. It is the evo lutio n o f bein g. That’s what’s go in g o n . It’s the evo lutio n o f bein g, n o t human kin d; the evo lutio n o f bein g is what reality is abo ut. We have these exp erien ces as human s. We are p ut in to this mix o f p hysical an d sp iritual, ho wever we’re p ut in to it. But it is the in dividual exp erien ce o f b eing an d ho w that bein g evo lves as we go thro ugh the human exp erien ce;this is what’s co n n ected to the realities o f what p o wer really is. Po wer is n o t a man -made device o r structure. Po wer is n o t a p o litical, religio us, o r so cial system. That’s n o t p o wer. Tho se are systems o f autho rity. The reality o f p o wer is an en tirely differen t reality, an d that reality is us—human bein gs; the p o wer o f the human bein g. But they dimin ished the p o wer o f the human bein g because we do n ’t thin k like human bein gs an ymo re, we do n ’t iden tify as human bein gs. We are citizen s o r Rep ublican s o r Demo crats o r liberals o r leftists o r In dian s o r wo men o r men o r victims; we’re everythin g but a human bein g. We do n o t p erceive an d p articip ate in this reality fro m the co n scio usn ess o f human bein gs. We p articip ate in this reality fro m the co n scio usn ess o f differen t labels an d victimizatio n s. But tho se are o n ly p arts an d we can ’t achieve what it is we’re lo o kin g fo r un less we un derstan d ho w to be a human bein g. To be a human bein g we have to co n n ect to the reality o f o ur relatio n ship to p o wer an d these are Origin al In structio n s. An o rigin al in structio n is that we have in telligen ce so we n eed to use it clearly an d co heren tly. We n eed to take resp o n sibility fo r o ur lives an d thin k. We must use o ur in telligen ce to thin k, to create the reality that must be created, because there are n o existin g so lutio n s. I guaran tee it. There is n o an swer to the p ro blem that is here an d n o w. That so lutio n do es n o t exist. Yo ur demo cracy, yo ur religio n s, n o n e o f it wo rks. Actually, all o f it is the ca use o f the p ro blems. Fo r there to be an y real so lutio n , we must create it. It is o n e thin g to say I resp ect traditio n an d I resp ect the Creato r an d I resp ect life an d all tho se thin gs. But we have the resp o n sibility to use o ur in telligen ce clearly an d co heren tly so we can man ifest that resp ect in to a co heren t, balan ced reality. Ho w bad can yo u make yo urself feel thro ugh yo ur fears, yo ur do ubts, an d yo ur in securities? Yo u can sit aro un d feelin g p o werless. Ho w bad can yo u make yo urself feel thro ugh yo ur fears, yo ur do ubts, an d yo ur in securities an d ho w do es that affect the p eo p le aro un d yo u? If yo u have the ability to do that, that’s yo ur p o wer. So this deal abo ut bein g p o werless o r feelin g p o werless is all a lie. We have p o wer. It is p erp etual. We co n stan tly have p o wer, an d we’re co n stan tly usin g it o r it’s bein g misused. We’re n o t usin g it in the way all the sp iritual ho ly ho lies wan t us to use it. So let’s take o ur clear, co heren t min ds an d use o ur p o wer an d sho w resp ect to the Creato r. To sho w resp ect to the Creato r an d the creatio n , we sho uld value the gifts an d take resp o n sibility fo r the to o ls that we were given . This is the p o wer o f a human bein g. The thin g abo ut ho p e is it was the last thin g in Pan do ra’s bo x o f evil. I was a little kid an d they said, the go ds gave Pan do ra the bo x o f evil an d they to ld her n o t to o p en it. She o p en ed it an yway, because she was a wo man , right? So she o p en ed it an yway an d the seven evils o f the wo rld came o ut. In ciden tally, ho p e came o ut. But ho p e is there to help us co p e with the evil, right? I was in the sixth o r seven th grade when I first heard this, but I go t it even then . Ho ld it. It’s the bo x o f evil, fo o l. Ho p e’s lyin g. Ho p e is the biggest evil o f all. They didn ’t say the bo x o f evil “p lus ho p e.” I kn o w there was n o sho rtage o f bo xes because they’d been p uttin g o ur tho ught an d co n scio usn ess in bo xes fo rever, so I kn o w it wasn ’t abo ut that. But the subtleties o f this is when we take certain so un ds an d wo rds like ho p e, we thin k it is go o d fo r us. Ho p e is waitin g to be served. I thin k it’s better to p ray, to activate o ur in telligen ce. It is all a matter o f ho w we use o ur in telligen ce an d o ur thin kin g p ro cess. Part o f the reaso n fo r the situatio n that we’re in is because almo st everythin g we’re do in g is a co n tradictio n to the resp o n sibility o f bein g. Our in telligen ce an d the p o wer o f o ur in telligen ce have been p ut in to a bo x. We’ve been p ro grammed to believe, we have n o t been taught to thin k. We’ve n o t been en co uraged to thin k. We’ve been p ro grammed to believe. What hap p en ed to us, to the Native Peo p les o n this hemisp here, hap p en ed to yo ur tribes, all p eo p les. Yo u’re descen dan ts o f tribes an d it hap p en ed to yo ur tribes, it just hap p en ed to yo ur tribes befo re yo u go t here. An d then when yo u go t here, yo u did to us what they had do n e to yo u. All o f that was do n e to chan ge yo ur tribal p ercep tio n o f reality; to chan ge an d alter the sp iritual p ercep tio n o f reality an d turn it in to a religio us p ercep tio n o f reality, because there’s a differen ce between sp iritual an d religio us. Religio us is abo ut submissio n an d o bedien ce an d autho ritarian ism. Sp iritual is abo ut takin g resp o n sibility. We have to lo o k at this, submissio n is n o t takin g resp o n sibility. It is an easy, co n ven ien t o ut that they p ro grammed in to us that’s accep table. “Well, I submit to them because this is go o d.” I may be crazy, but they are in san e. Thin k abo ut it. We’re bo rn , there’s so methin g wro n g with us fo r bein g bo rn . We co mmit the o rigin al sin fo r bein g bo rn . Thin k abo ut that co heren tly. Yo u are the descen dan t o f a tribe. We are a ll the descen dan ts o f tribes. In the real reality, when we are bo rn in to this reality it’s like a givin g o f gifts. The gift o f life is given to the gift o f life. When we leave, it’s still co n tin uin g because it’s abo ut bein g. So it’s always abo ut the givin g o f life. But here we are n o w, p ut in to a reality where we believe we co mmitted a crime fo r bein g bo rn . Then yo u n ever see yo urself ever again the way yo u really were p ut here because yo u see yo urself thro ugh judgmen t. All o f these are Origin al In structio n s in so meo n e’s religio n . Our resp o n sibility is to reco gn ize life, n o t to judge it. We have to reco gn ize life an d n o t judge it because judgmen t is blin din g. Yo u can n o t judge an d reco gn ize simultan eo usly. Yo u can n o t believe an d thin k simultan eo usly. Maybe o ccasio n ally because there’s always an aberratio n , but yo u can n o t believe an d thin k simultan eo usly all the time because belief limits thin kin g. Believin g p uts thin kin g in a bo x. So all thin kin g that go es o n is limited by the defin itio n s o f the belief. We n eed to have an un derstan din g o f this p ro cess because everythin g that ever hap p en ed, hap p en ed to make us believe what they wan ted us to believe. They wan ted us to believe that there was so methin g wro n g with us an d that we had to o bey them. This was the gig they ran o n the tribes o f Euro p e an d the descen dan ts o f the tribes o f Euro p e an d they ran it here. But it was abo ut alterin g o ur p ercep tio n o f reality fro m a sp iritual p ercep tio n o f reality in to a min in g p ercep tio n o f reality. The min in g to o ls became religio n an d go vern men t an d p o litics an d racism an d sexism an d all o f these o ther divisive thin gs. Min in g to o ls are n o t who we are. We are human bein gs—o ur bo n e, flesh, an d blo o d is made up the metals, min erals, an d liq uids o f the earth. We have bein g that is o ur sp irit, o ur en ergy, an d o ur essen ce. All thin gs o f the earth are made up o f the same thin g. All thin gs o f the earth have bein g. They can take the bein g o ut o f the earth, that’s uran ium. They p ut it thro ugh a min in g p ro cess an d co n vert it to bein g a fo rm o f p o werful en ergy. They do it with fo ssils. They do it with us. They take the bein g p art o f human ity an d min e the bein g p art o f human ity thro ugh ho w they p ro gram us to p erceive reality. They then take that an d they turn that in to fuel to run this system that we’re in . This is the gig that go es o n all the time. But to be a human bein g, we have to co n n ect to the reality o f o ur relatio n ship to p o wer an d this is an o rigin al in structio n .
