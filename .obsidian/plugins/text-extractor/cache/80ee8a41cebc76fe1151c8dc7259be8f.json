Stay home and chill. ▪ Or not. Doesn’t matter – as long as you’re not coming here for a class that won’t happen 4 A Question! ▪ What is the difference of construct validity and internal validity, and could you give an example of the two? 5 A Question! Smoking cessation program offered Students who sign up Smoking cessation program Smoking frequency 1 pack/week 6 A Question! ▪ Internal validity: Change in IV Confounds? Alternative explanations? Concerned about setup of study 7 A Question! Did cause ? Smoking cessation program offered Students who sign up Smoking cessation program Smoking frequency 1 pack/week 8 A Question! ▪ Construct validity Do they reflect the same thing? Variables measured/manipulated properly? 9 A Question! Smoking cessation program offered Students who sign up Smoking cessation program Smoking frequency 1 pack/week 10 A Question! ▪ Internal validity independent from construct validity Angry thoughts Internal validity Construct validity 11 A Question! ▪ Internal validity independent from construct validity Internal validity Construct validity Willingness to watch Netflix 12 Designs and threats ▪ ABA reversal design ▪ One-group posttest only ▪ One-group pretest posttest ▪ Non-equivalent control group ▪ Non-equivalent control group pretest posttest ▪ History ▪ Maturation ▪ Testing ▪ Instrument decay ▪ Regression towards the mean 13 History Maturation Testing Instrument decay Regression towards the mean ABA reversal design One-group posttest only One-group pretest- posttest Non-equivalent control group Non-equivalent control group pretest-posttest Weak against this? Strong against this? Not applicable? 1415 Developmental designs ▪ Cross-sectional 30 year-old men 55 year-old men 80 year-old men Willingness to believe random things they read on the internet 16 Developmental designs ▪ Longitudinal 30 year-old men Time 1 55 year-old men Time 2 80 year-old men Time 3 17 Developmental designs ▪ Integrate? Sequential 30 year-old men 55 year-old men Time 1 50 year-old men 75 year-old men Time 2 70 year-old men 95 year-old men Time 3 18 Learning Objectives ▪ By the end of this class, you will be able to: ▫ Explain a benefit of factorial designs ▫ Interpret main effects and interaction from a graph and a table ▫ Explain an interaction effect using simple main effects 19 Complex Study Designs ▪ Complex (factorial) designs = 2 or more factors ▫ Factors = any variable that you expect to be related to some outcome variable (e.g. independent variable) ▪ Progression of discussion of complex (factorial) designs: ▫ 2 manipulated factors ▫ 1 manipulated factor, 1 non-manipulated factor 20 Important definition: ▪ Interaction: ▫ Effect of one factor on the outcome variable depends on another factor 21 Factorial designs: An example It’s Dr Heine! 22 Factorial designs – doggy style ▪ Dr. Heine experiments on all dogs at neighbourhood pet store ▫ Gets 80 dogs ▪ Command: He tells half of the dogs to sit, and says nothing to the other half ▪ Presence of food: He holds a treat for half of the dogs, and holds nothing for the other half Command Dr. Heine Dogs Pet store Presence of food 23 Factorial designs – doggy style IV #1: Command (No “Sit” vs. “Sit”) IV #2: Food (No treat vs. Treat) DV: Proportion of dogs sitting 24 Factorial designs – doggy style Presence of Food No Treat Treat Command No “Sit” “Sit” Specifically, 2 x 2 factorial design (read: 2 by 2) # of levels of first factor # of levels of second factor Known as 2-way factorial design # of factors Cell 25 Factorial designs – doggy style Presence of Food No Treat Treat Command No “Sit” n = 20 n = 20 n = 40 “Sit” n = 20 n = 20 n = 40 n = 40 n = 40 n = 80 26 Factorial designs – doggy style Presence of Food No Treat Treat Marginal mean of command Command No “Sit” 0.10 0.14 “Sit” 0.30 0.90 Marginal mean of presence of food Main Effect of Command on the proportion of dogs sitting>0.12 0.60 27 Factorial designs – doggy style Presence of Food No Treat Treat Marginal mean of command Command No “Sit” 0.10 0.14 “Sit” 0.30 0.90 Marginal mean of presence of food > 0.20 0.52 Main Effect of Presence of Food on the proportion of dogs that sit 28 Factorial designs – doggy style Presence of Food No Treat Treat Marginal mean of command Command No “Sit” 0.10 0.14 0.12 “Sit” 0.30 0.90 0.60 Marginal mean of presence of food>>> +0.48+0.76+0.20 OVERALL: More dogs sit when commanded to sit Way more dogs sit when commanded to sit A few more dogs sit when commanded to sit","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
