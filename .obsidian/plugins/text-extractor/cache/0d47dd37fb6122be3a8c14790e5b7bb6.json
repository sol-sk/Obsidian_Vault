Introduction In his splendid introduction to this volume, Herbert Feigl rightly stress- es the central importance of the distinction between the context of discov- ery and the context of justification. These terms were introduced by Hans Reichenbach to distinguish the social and psychological facts surrounding the discovery of a scientific hypothesis from the evidential considerations relevant to its justification.1 The folklore of science is full of dramatic ex- amples of the distinction; e.g., Kepler's mystical sense of celestial har- mony2 versus the confrontation of the postulated orbits with the observa- tions of Tycho; Kekuie' s drowsing vision of dancing snakes3 versus the laboratory confirmation of the hexagonal structure of the benzine ring; Ramanujan's visitations in sleep by the Goddess of Namakkal4 versus his waking demonstrations of the mathematical theorems. Each of these ex- amples offers a fascinating insight into the personality of a working scien- tist, and each provides a vivid contrast between those psychological factors and the questions of evidence that must be taken into account in order to assess the truth or probability of the result. Moreover, as we all learned in our freshman logic courses, to confuse the source of a proposition with the evidence for it is to commit the genetic fallacy. If one accepts the distinction between discovery and justification as vi- able, there is a strong temptation to maintain that this distinction marks the boundaries between history of science and philosophy of science.

As a matter of fact, Reichenbach described the transition from the context of discovery to the context of justification in terms of a rational reconstruction. On the one hand, the scientific innovator engages in thought processes that may be quite irrational or nonrational, manifesting 110 apparent logical structure: this is the road to discovery. On the other hand, when he wants to present his results to the community for judg- ment, he provides a reformulation in which the hypotheses and theories are shown in logical relation to the evidence that is offered in support of them: this is his rational reconstruction. The items in the context of dis- covery are psychologically relevant to the scientific conclusion; those in the context of justification are logically relevant to it. Since the philosopher of science is concerned with logical relations, not psychological ones, he is concerned with the rationally reconstructed theory, not with the actual process by which it came into being. Views of the foregoing sort regarding the relations between the context of discovery and the context of justification have led to a conception of philosophy of science which might aptly be characterized as a \"rational rcconstructionist\" or \"logical reconstructionist\" approach; this approach lias been closely associated with the school of logical positivism, though by 110 means confined to it.5 Critics of the reconstructionist view have sug- gested that it leaves the study of vital, living, growing science to the his- 1 orian, while relegating philosophy of science to the dissection of scientific ('()rpses-not the bodies of scientists, but of theories that have grown to the point of stagnation and ossification. According to such critics, the study of rnrnpleted science is not the study of science at all. One cannot under- ~tand science unless he sees how it grows; to comprehend the logical struc- 1 mc of science, it is necessary to take account of scientific change and scientific revolution. Certain philosophers have claimed, consequently, 1 hat philosophy of science must deal with the logic of discovery as well as t lic logic of justification.6 Philosophy of science, it has been said, cannot proceed apart from study of the history of science. Such arguments have \" llcichcnhach, for example, was not a logical positivist; indeed, he was one of the 1·111 licst am! most influential critics of that school. • Sec, for example, N . R .

Salmon led to a challenge of the very distinction between discovery and justifica- tion .7 Application of this distinction, it is claimed, has led to the recon- structionist approach, which separates philosophy of science from real science, and makes philosophy of science into an unrealistic and uninter- esting form of empty symbol manipulation. The foregoing remarks make it clear, I hope, that the distinction be- tween the context of discovery and the context of justification is a major focal point for any fundamental discussion of the relations between his- tory of science and philosophy of science. As the dispute seems to shape up, the reconstructionists rely heavily upon the viability of a sharp dis- tinction, and they apparently conclude that there is no very significant re- lation between the two disciplines. Such marriages as occur between them -e .g., the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science, the National Science Foundation Panel for History and Philosophy of Sci- ence, and the Departments of History and Philosophy of Science at Mel- bourne and Indiana-are all marriages of convenience. The anti-recon- structionists, who find a basic organic unity between the two disciplines, seem to regard a rejection of the distinction between discovery and justifi- cation as a cornerstone of their view. Whatever approach one takes, it ap- pears that the distinction between the context of discovery and the con- text of justification is the first order of business. I must confess at this point, if it is not already apparent, that I am an unreconstructed reconstructionist, and I believe that the distinction be- tween the context of discovery and the context of justification is viable, significant, and fundamental to the philosophy of science. I do not believe, however, that this view commits me to an intellectual divorce from my historical colleagues; in the balance of this essay I should like to explain why. I shall not be concerned to argue in favor of the distinction, but shall instead try (I) to clarify the distinction, and repudiate certain common misconceptions of it, ( 2) to show that a clear analysis of the nature of sci- entific confirmation is essential to an understanding of the distinction, and that a failure to deal adequately with the logic of confirmation can lead to serious historical misinterpretations, and ( 3) to argue that an adequate conception of the logic of confirmation leads to basic, and largely un- noticed, logical functions of historical information. In other words, I shall be attempting to show how certain aspects of the relations between history 7 E.g., Thomas S. Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Rcvol11tio11s (Chirngo : Univer- sity of Chicago Press, 1962), p . 9. 70 BAYES's THEOREM AND THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE :md philosophy of science can be explicated within the reconstructionist framework. Some of my conclusions may appear idiosyncratic, but I shall lake some pains along the way to argue that many of these views are widely shared. 1. The Distinction between Discovery and Justification When one presents a distinction, it is natural to emphasize the differ- ences between the two sorts of things, and to make the distinction appear 111ore dichotomous than is actually intended. In the present instance, some ( ommentators have apparently construed the distinction to imply that, lirst of all, a creative scientist goes through a great succession of irrational (or nonrational) processes, e.g., dreaming, being hit on the head, pacing I he floor, or having dyspepsia, until a full-blown hypothesis is born. Only :1fter these processes have terminated does the scientist go through the I( 1gical process of mustering and presenting his evidence so as to justify his l1ypothesis. Such a conception would, of course, be factually absurd; dis- rnvcry and justification simply do not occur in that way. A more realistic 11<Totmt might go somewhat as follows. A scientist, searching for a hy- 1H11 hes is to explain some phenomenon, hits upon an idea, but soon casts it 11.\\idc because he sees that it is inconsistent with some theory he accepts, '•r because it does not really explain the phenomenon in question. This 1•l1asc undoubtedly involves considerable logical inference; it might, for 111slance, involve a mathematical calculation which shows that the explana- 1i1111 in question would not account for a result of the correct order of mag- 11iI11dc. After more searching around-in the meantime perhaps he attends 11 rncktail party and spends a restless night-he hits upon another idea, ll'hich also proves to be inadequate, but he sees that it can be improved by •111111c modification or other. Again, by logical inference, he determines that Im new hypothesis bears certain relations to the available evidence. He I 111 I ltcr realizes, however, that although his present hypothesis squares 11· 1II1 the known facts, further modification would make it simpler and give II :1 wider explanatory range. Perhaps he devises and executes additional 11\",ls 1·0 check the applicability of his latest revision in new domains. And ~\" i I 1•ocs. What I am trying to suggest, by such science fiction, is that the 1 •1111·csscs of discovery and justification are intimately intertwined, with •ii q >\\ of one type al tcmating with steps of the other. There is no reason to 1111l<'l11dc, from a distin ction between the context of discovery and the 1 111ilcxl of j11stificalio11, lhat the entire process of discovery must be com- 71 Wesley C. Salmon pleted before the process of justification can begin, and that the rational reconstruction can be undertaken only after the creative work has ended. Such conc1usions are by no means warranted by the reconstructionist approach. There is, moreover, no reason to suppose that the two contexts must be mutually exclusive. Not only may elements of the context of justification be temporally intercalated between elements of the context of discovery, but the two contexts may have items in common. Tile supposition that this cannot happen is perhaps the most widespread misunderstanding of the distinction between the two contexts. The most obvious example is the case in which a person or a machine discovers the answer to a problem by applying an algorithm, e.g., doing a sum, differentiating a polynomial, or finding a greatest common divisor. Empirical science also contains rou- tine methods for finding answers to problems-which is to say, for discov- ering correct hypotheses. These are often the kinds of procedures that can be delegated to a technician or a machine, e.g., chemical analyses, ballistic testing, or determination of physical constants of a new compound. In such cases, the process of discovery and the process of justification may be nearly identical, though the fact that the machine blew a fuse, or the tech- nician took a coffee break, could hardly qualify for inclusion in the latter context. Even though the two contexts are not mutually exclusive, the distinction does not vanish. The context of discovery consists of a number of items related to one another by psychological relevance, while the con- text of justification contains a number of items related to one another by (inductive and deductive) logical relevance. There is no reason at all why one and the same item cannot be both psychologically and logically rele- vant to some given hypothesis . Each context is a complex of entities all of which are interrelated in particular ways. The contexts are contrasted with one another, not on the ground that they can have no members in com- mon, but rather on the basis of differences in -the types of relations they incorporate. The fact that the two contexts can have items in common does not mean that the distinction is useless or perverse, for there are dif- ferences between logical and psychological relevance relations which arc important for the understanding of science. The problem of scientific discovery does not end with the thinking up of a hypothesis. One has also to discover evidence ancl the logical con nec- tions between the evidence and the hypothesis. Th e process of discovery is, therefore, involved in t-11c very constrn ction of Hi e rational rcconstrn c- 72 BAYEs' s THEOREM AND THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE tion. When the scientist publishes his hypothesis as acceptable, confirmed, or corroborated, along with the evidence and arguments upon which the claim is based, he is offering his rational reconstruction (the one he has discovered), and is presumably claiming that it is logically sound. This is a fact about the scientist; his evidence and arguments satisfy him. A critic- scientist or philosopher-might, of course, show that he has committed a logical or methodological error, and consequently, that his rational recon- struction is unsound. Such an occurrence would belong to the context of j11stification. However, even if the argument seems compelling to an entire scientific community, it may still be logically faulty. The convincing char- :tcter of an argument is quite distinct from its validity; the former is a psy- diological characteristic, the latter is logical. Once more, even though I here may be extensive overlap between the contexts of discovery and j11stification, it is important not to confuse them. Considerations of the foregoing sort have led to serious controversy over 1 ltc appropriate role of philosophy of science. On the other hand, it is mmetimes claimed that philosophy of science must necessarily be a his- 1 orically oriented empirical study of the methods scientists of the past 1tttcl present have actually used, and of the canons they have accepted. On 1 ltc other hand, it is sometimes maintained that such factual studies of the tt1cthods of science belong to the domain of the historian, and that the pltilosopher of science is concerned exclusively with logical and epistemo- 111gical questions. Proponents of the latter view-which is essentially the 1('rnnstructionist approach-may appear quite open to the accusation that 1I1cy are engaged in some sort of scholastic symbol mongering which has 1111 connection whatever with actual science. To avoid this undesirable \"l:itc of affairs, it may be suggested, we ought to break down the distinc- l 1011s between history and philosophy, between psychology and logic, and, till imatcly, between discovery and justification. ·I 'here is, I believe, a better alternative. While the philosopher of science 111:1y he basically concerned with abstract logical relations, he can hardly 1tllmcl 1-0 ignore the actual methods that scientists have found acceptable. 11 :1 philosopher expounds a theory of the logical structure of science ac- 1·111 «lit tg 1-0 which almost all of modern physical science is methodologically t 111.':011ncl, it· would be far more reasonable to conclude that the philosophi- 111 I t c;1so11ing had gone astray than to suppose that modern science is logi- ' .ill y 111isconccivccl. J11st as certain empirical facts, such as geometrical dia- 1:111111s or soa p film cxpcrimcnl:s, may have great heuristic value for mathc-. Wesley C. Salmon matics, so too may the historical facts of scientific development provide in- dispensable guidance for the formal studies of the logician. In spite of this, the philosopher of science is properly concerned with issues of logical cor- rectness which cannot finally be answered by appeal to the history of sci- ence. One of the problems with which the philosopher of science might grapple is the question of what grounds we have for supposing scientific knowledge to be superior to other alleged types of knowledge, e.g., al- chemy, astrology, or divination. The historian may be quick to reply that he has the means to answer that question, in terms of the relative success of physics, chemistry, and astronomy. It required the philosophical subtle- ty of David Hume to realize that such an answer involves a circular argu- ment.8 The philosopher of science, consequently, finds himself attempting to cope with problems on which the historical data may provide enormous- ly useful guidance, but the solutions, if they are possible at all, must be logical, not historical, in character. The reason, ultimately, is that justifica- tion is a normative concept, while history provides only the facts. I have been attempting to explain and defend the distinction between discovery and justification largely by answering objections to it, rather than by offering positive arguments. My attitude, roughly, is that it is such a plausible distinction to begin with, and its application yields such rich re- wards in understanding, that it can well stand without any further justifi- cation. Like any useful tool, however, it must be wielded with some finesse; otherwise the damage it does may far outweigh its utility. 2. Bayes' s Theorem and the Context of Justification It would be a travesty to maintain, in any simpleminded way, that the historian of science is concerned only with matters of discovery, and not with matters of justification. In dealing with any significant case, say the replacement of an old theory by a new hypothesis, the historian will be deeply interested in such questions as whether, to what extent, and in what manner the old theory has been disconfirmed; and similarly, what evidence is offered in support of the new hypothesis, and how adequate it is. How strongly, he may ask, are factors such as national rivalry among scientists, esthetic disgust with certain types of theories, personal idiosyncrasies of influential figures, and other nonevidential factors operative? Since science aspires to provide objective knowledge of the world, it cannot he under- • For further elaboration of this point see my Foundations of Scientific Tufcrcncc (Pittsburgh: University of Pittslmrgl1 Press, 1967), pp. 5- 17. 74 BAYES 1S THEOREM AND THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE stood historically without taking very seriously the role of evidence in sci- entific development and change. Such historical judgments-whether a particular historical development was or was not rationally justified on the basis of the evidence available at the time-depend crucially upon the his- torian's understanding of the logic of confirmation and disconfirmation. Tf the historian seriously misunderstands the logic of confirmation, he runs Hie risk of serious historical misevaluation. And to the possible rejoinder !hat any historian worth his salt has a sufficiently clear intuitive sense of what constitutes relevant scientific evidence and what does not, I must simply reply that I am not convinced. Perhaps the most widely held picture of scientific confirmation is one I hat had great currency in the nineteenth century; it is known as the hypo- 1 lietico-deductive (H-D) method. According to this view, a scientific hy- pothesis is tested by deducing observational consequences from it, and seeing whether these consequences actually do transpire. If a given conse- q 11cnce does occur, it constitutes a confirming instance for the hypothesis; if it does not occur, it is a disconfirming instance. There are two rather im- 111ccliate difficulties with this characterization, and they are easily repaired. l'irst, a scientific hypothesis, by itself, ordinarily does not have any obser- v:ll ional consequences; it is usually necessary to supply some empirically dctumined initial conditions to make it possible validly to deduce any observational consequences at all. For example, from Kepler's law of plane- l:1ry motion alone, it is impossible to deduce the position of Mars at some I 11 I me time, but with initial conditions on the motion of Mars at some c:1rlicr time, a prediction of the position is possible. Similarly, from I looke's law alone it is impossible to predict the elongation of a spring un- 11<-r a given weight, but with an empirically determined coefficient of elas- 1 i1 ·ii y, the prediction can be deduced. Second, it is frequently, if not al- 11':1 ys, necessary to make use of auxiliary hypotheses in order to connect the 11i>scrvations with the hypothesis that is being tested . For example, if a 11wdical experimenter predicts that a certain bacillus will be found in the hl11od of a certain organism, he must conjoin to his medical hypothesis 1111xi liary hypotheses of optics which pertain to the operation of his micro- 'll'11pc, for only in that way can he establish a deductive connection be- 1 W<\"<\" ll wl1at: lie ohscrvcs under the microscope and the actual presence of Ii i!' 111icroorga nism . With th ese additions, the H-D method can be sche- 111111 i·/.(·d :rs follows: 7~ Wesley C. Salmon H (hypothesis being tested) A (auxiliary hypotheses) I (initial conditions) 0 (observational consequence) Since we are not primarily interested in epistemological problems about the reliability of the senses, let us assume for the purposes of the present discussion that the initial conditions I have been established as true by observation and, in addition, that we can ascertain by observation whether the observational consequence 0 is true or false. Let us assume, moreover, that for purposes of the present test of our hypothesis H, the auxiliary hy- potheses A are accepted as unproblematic.9 With these simplifying ideali- zations, we can say that H implies O; consequently if 0 turns out to be false, it follows that H must be false-this is the deductively valid modus toIIens. Given the truth of 0, however, nothing follows deductively about tpe truth of H. To infer the truth of H from the truth of 0 in these cir- cumstances is obviously the elementary deductive fallacy of affirming the consequent. According to the H-D view the truth of 0 does, nevertheless, tend to confirm or lend probability to H. Presumably, if enough of the right kinds of observational consequences are deduced and found by ob- servation to be true-i.e., if enough observational predictions are borne out by experience-the hypothesis can become quite highly confirmed. Scientific hypotheses can never be completely and irrefutably verified in this manner, but they can become sufficiently confirmed to be scientifi- cally acceptable. According to this H-D conception, induction-the logi- cal relation involved in the confirmation of scientific hypotheses-is a kind of inverse of deduction. The fact that a true observational prediction follows deductively from a given hypothesis (in conjunction with initial conditions and auxiliary hypotheses) means, according to the H-D view, that a relation of inductive support runs in the reverse direction from 0 toH. The H-D account of scientific confirmation is, it seems to me, woefully inadequate. The situation is nicely expressed in a quip attributed to Morris R. Cohen: A logic text is a book that contains two parts; in the first (on deduction) the fallacies are explained, and in the second (on induction) they are committed. Quite clearly, we need a more satisfactory account of •This is, of course, an unrealistic assumption , for as Pierre Dnhem pointed out, in many cases the appropriate move upon encountering a disconfirming case is rej ection nr n,io~ification of an auxiliary h ypoth esis, rnthc~ than rejection of the princ ipal hypothesis. 1 l11s pomt clocs not affect th e present d1sc11ss1011. 76 BAYES's THEOREM AND THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE scientific confirmation. Automatically transforming a deductive fallacy into a correct inductive schema may offer an appealing way to account for scientific inference, but certainly our forms of inductive inference ought lo have better credentials than that. The main shortcomings of the H-D 111ethod are strongly suggested by the fact that, given any finite body of observational evidence, there are infinitely many hypotheses which are confirmed by it in exactly the same manner; that is, there are infinitely 111any alternative hypotheses that could replace our hypothesis H in the schema above and still yield a valid deduction. This point is obvious if one considers the number of curves that can be drawn through a finite set of points on a graph. Hence, Hooke's law, which says that a certain function is a straight line, and Kepler's first law, which says that a planetary orbit is :111 ellipse, could each be replaced by infinitely many alternatives that would give rise to precisely the same observational consequences as I fooke's and Kepler's laws respectively. As it stands, the H-D method gives 11s no basis whatever for claiming that either of these laws is any better rnnfirmed by the available evidence than is any one of the infinitude of 11 ll-crnatives. Clearly it stands in dire need of supplementation. When we look around for a more adequate account of scientific con- lirmation, it is natural to see whether the mathematical calculus of prob- 1il 1ility can offer any resources. If we claim that the process of confirmation i~ one of lending probability to a hypothesis in the light of evidence, it is 1 !':1sonable to see whether there are any theorems on probability that char- 1wlcrize confirmation. If so, such a theorem would provide some sort of v:ilicl schema for formal confirmation relations. Theorems do not, of r1111rsc, come labeled for their specific applications, but Bayes's theorem c lc >cs seem well suited for this role.10 I 11 order to illuminate the use of Bayes's theorem, let us introduce a ·i1111ple game. This game is played with two decks of cards made up as lollows: deck I contains eight red and four black cards; deck II contains ln11r red and eight black cards. A turn begins with the toss of an ordinary di(': if 1·hc side six appears the player draws from deck I, and if any other •11d!' comes up he draws from deck IL The draw of a red card constitutes a 11·i11. There is a simple way to calculate the probability of a win in this '\" I li:IV(; cliscusscd th e Bayesian conception of confirmation at some length in Founda- l /1111.v of Scic11tific Tnfcrc11cc, pp . 108-131 (Bayes's theorem is deduced within the for- 11111 1 l'lil l'11l11s on pp . 58- 62 ) , and in \"Tnqnirics into the Foundations of Science,\" in \\l /•llu.v i11 Scic11cc. ed .

Letting P ( A,B) stand for the probability from A to B (i.e., the probability of B, given A), and letting A stand for tosses of the die, B for draws from deck I, and C for draws resulting in red, the following formula yields the desired probability: (1) P(A,C) = P (A,B )P(A & B,C) + P(A,-B )P (A & -B ,C) where the ampersand stands for \"and\" and the tilde preceding a symbol negates it. Probability expressions appearing in the formula are P ( A,C), probability of a red card on a play of this game; P ( A,B), probability of drawing from deck I (= 1/ 6) ; P(A,-B), probability of drawing from deck II(= 5/ 6); P(A & B,C) , probability of getting red on a draw from deck I ( = 2/ 3); P (A & ,_, B,C) , probability of getting red on a draw from deck II ( = 1/ 3). The probability of a win on any given play is 7 / 18. Suppose, now, that a player has just drawn a red card, but you fail ed to notice from which deck he drew. We ask, what is the probability that it was drawn from deck I? The probability we wish to ascertain is P (A & C, B), the probability that a play which resulted in a red card was one on which the die turned up six, and the draw was made from deck I. Bayes's theorem (2) P(A&CB) _ P(A,B)P(A&B,C) ' - P(A,B )P(A & B,C) + P(A,-B )P(A & -B ,C) supplies the answer. Substituting the available values on the right-hand side of the equation yields the value 2/ 7 for the desired probability. Note that although the probability of getting a red card if you draw from deck I is much greater than the probability of getting a red card if you draw from deck II, the probability that a given red draw came from deck I is much less than the probability that it came from deck II. This is because the vast majority of draws are made from deck II. There is nothing controversial about either of the foregoing formulas, or about their application to games of the kind just described. The only difficulty concerns the legitimacy of extending the application of Bayes's theorem, formula (2), to the problem of confirmation of hypotheses. In order to see how that might go, let me redescribe the game, with some admitted stretching of usage. We can take the draw of a red card as an effect that can be produced in either of two ways, by throwing a six and drawing from deck I, or by tossing some other number and drawing from the other deck. There are, correspondingly, two causal hypotheses. When we ask for the probability that the red draw came from deck J, we arc ask- 78 BA YES' S THEOREM AND THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE ing for the probability of the first of these hypotheses, given the evidence that a red card had been drawn. Looking now at the probability expres- sions that appear in Bayes's theorem, we have: P ( A,B), the prior probabil- ity of the first hypothesis; P (A,,_, B), the prior probability that the first hypothesis does not hold; P(A & B,C) , the probability of the effect (red card drawn) if the first hypothesis is correct; P(A & -B,C), the probabil- ity of the effect if the first hypothesis is incorrect; P (A & C,B), the pos- terior probability of the first hypothesis on the evidence that the effect has occurred. The probabilities P(A & B,C) and P(A & -B ,C) are called likelihoods of the two hypotheses, but it is important to note clearly that lhey are not probabilities of hypotheses but, rather, probabilities of the effect. It is the posterior probability that we seek when we wish to deter- mine the probability of the hypothesis in terms of the given evidence. In order to apply Bayes's theorem, we must have three probabilities to plug into the right-hand side of (2). Since the two prior probabilities must ;1cld up to one, it is sufficient to know one of them, but the likelihoods are independent, so we just have both of them. Thus, in order to compute the posterior probability of our hypothesis, we need its prior probability, the probability that we would get the evidence we have if it is true, and the probability that we would get the evidence we have if it were false. None of these three is dispensable, except in a few obvious special cases.11 When the H-D schema was presented, we stipulated that the hypothesis !icing tested implied the evidence, so in that case P(A & B,C) = 1. This value of one of the likelihoods does not determine a value for the posterior probability, and, indeed, the posterior probability can be arbitrarily small t·vcn in the case supplied by the H-D method. This fact shows the inade- q11:Jcy of the H-D schema quite dramatically: even though the data con- fi rm the hypothesis according to the H-D view, the posterior probability of 1-hc hypothesis in the light of the available evidence may be as small as you like-even zero in the limiting special case in which the prior prob- :i hility of the hypothesis is zero. If Bayes's theorem provides a correct formal schema for the logic of con- lll'l11ation and disconfirmation of scientific hypotheses, it tells us that we 11ccd to take account of three factors in attempting to assess the degree to wli icli a hypothesis is rendered probable by the evidence. Roughly, it says, \"V iz .. if I' ( A,Il) = 0 or P (A & Il,C) = 0, then P(A & C,B) = O; if P(A,--B ) = 0 \"\" l'( A & ~ n,C) = 0, lhcn P(A & C,ll ) = I. Also, if P(A,C ) = 0, the fraction he- ' • •111 C\"s ind cl t·n11i11al c, fo r, l>y ( l ) . tha t is th e dc110111inator in ( 2) _ 79 Wesley C. Salmon we must consider how well our hypothesis explains the evidence we have (this is what the H-D schema requires), how well an alternative hypothe- sis might explain the same evidence, and the prior probability of the hy- pothesis. The philosophical obstacle that has always stood in the way of using Bayes's theorem to account for confirmation is the severe difficulty in understanding what a prior probability could be. I have argued else- where that it is essentially an assessment of what one might call the plausi- bility of the hypothesis, prior to, or apart from, the results of directly test- ing that hypothesis. 12 Without attempting to analyze what is meant by plausibility, I shall offer a few plausibility judgments of my own, just to illustrate the sort of thing I am talking about. For instance, I regard as quite implausible Velikovsky's hypotheses about the origin of Venus, any ESP theory that postulates transfer of information at a speed greater than that of light, and any teleological biological theory. Hypotheses of these kinds strike me as implausible because, in one way or another, they do not fit well with currently accepted scientific theory. I regard it as quite plaus- ible that life originated on the face of the earth in accordance with straight- forward physicochemical principles governing the formation of large \"or- ganic\" molecules out of simpler inorganic ones. This does seem to fit well with what we know. You need not accept my plausibility judgments; you can supply your own. The only crucial issue is the existence of such prior probabilities for use in connection with Bayes's theorem. Let us now return to the problems of the historian. I claim above that the analysis of the lOgic of confirmation could have a crucial bearing upon historical judgments. Having compared the H-D account of confirmation with the Bayesian analysis, we can see an obvious way in which this prob- lem could arise. If a historian accepts the H-D analysis of confirmation, then there is no place for plausibility judgments in the logic of science-at least not in the context of justification. If such a historian finds plausibility considerations playing an important role historically in the judgments scientists render upon hypotheses, he will be forced to exclude them from the context of justification, and he may conclude that the course of scien- tific development is massively influenced by nonrational or nonevidential considerations. Such an \"H-D historian\" might well decide, along with the editors of Harper's Magazine, that it was scientific prejudice, not objective evaluation, that made the scientific community largely ignore Velikovsky' s 10 Foundations of Scientific Inference and \"Inquiries into the Foundations of Sci- ence.\" 80 BAYEs's THEOREM AND THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE views. 13 He might similarly conclude that Einstein's commitment to the \"principle of relativity\" on the basis of plausibility arguments shows his views to have been based more upon preconceptions than upon objective evidence.14 A \"Bayesian historian,\" in contrast, will see these plausibility considerations as essential parts of the logic of confirmation, and he will place them squarely within the context of justification. The consequence is, I would say, that the historian of science who regards the H-D schema as a fully adequate characterization of the logical structure of scientific in- ference is in serious danger of erroneously excluding from the context of justification items that genuinely belong within it. The moral for the his- torian should be clear. There are considerations relating to the acceptance or rejection of scientific hypotheses which, on the H-D account, must be judged evidentially irrelevant to the truth or falsity of the hypothesis, but which are, nevertheless, used by scientists in making decisions about such acceptance or rejection. These same items, on the Bayesian account, be- come evidentially relevant. Hence, the judgment of whether scientists are making decisions on the basis of evidence, or on the basis of various psy- chological or social factors that are evidentially irrelevant, hinges crucially upon the question of whether the H-D or the Bayesian account of scien- t\"ific inference is more nearly correct. It is entirely conceivable that one historian might attribute acceptance of a given hypothesis to nonrational considerations, while another might judge the same decision to have an entirely adequate rational basis. Which account is historically more satis- factory will depend mainly upon which account of scientific inference is more adequate. The historian can hardly be taken to be unconcerned with I he context of justification, and with its differences from the context of discovery; indeed, if he is to do his job properly he must understand them very well . 3. The Status of Prior Probabilities It would be rather easy, I imagine, for the historian, and others who are 11ot intimately familiar with the technicalities of inductive logic and con- fi rmation theory, to suppose that the H-D account of scientific inference is f'l1c correct one. This view is frequently expressed in the opening pages of inl-rocluctory science texts, and in elementary logic books.15 At the same \"' ·I 'his case is discussed in \"Inquiries into the Foundations of Science.\" \"Sec /\\lhert F.instein, \"/\\utobiograph,ical Notes,\" in Albert Einstein: Phi1osopher- S1·ic111\"i.~t. ed. 1':1111 /\\rthnr Schilpp (New York : Tudor, 1949), pp. 2-95 . '\" I 11 111y Logic, section B, I have tried, with out introducing any technicalities of 81 Wesley C. Salmon time, it is important to raise the question of whether scientists in general -including the authors of the aforementioned introductory texts-actual- ly comply with the H-D method in practice, or whether in fact they use something similar to the Bayesian approach sketched in the preceding section. I am strongly inclined to believe that the Bayesian schema comes closer than the H-D schema to capturing actual scientific practice, for it seems to me that scientists do make substantial use of plausibility consid- erations, even though they may feel somewhat embarrassed to admit it. I believe also that practicing scientists have excellent intuitions regarding what constitutes sound scientific methodology, but that they may not al- ways be especially adept at fully articulating them. If we want the soundest guidance on the nature of scientific inference, we should look carefully at scientific practice, rather than the methodological pronouncements of scientists. It is, moreover, the almost universal judgment of contemporary induc- tive logicians-the experts who concern themselves explicitly with the problems of confirmation of scientific hypotheses-that the simple H-D schema presented above is incomplete and inadequate. Acknowledging the well-known fact that there is very little agreement on which particular formulation among many available ones is most nearly a correct inductive logic, we can sti11 see that among a wide variety of influential current ap- proaches to the problems of confirmation, there is at least agreement in rejecting the H-D method. This is not the place to go into detailed discus- sions of the alternative theories, but I should like to mention five leading candidates, indicating how each demands something beyond what is con- tained in the H-D schema. In each case, I think, what needs to be added is closely akin to the plausibility considerations mentioned in the preceding section. 1. The most fully developed explicit confirmation theory available is Rudolf Carnap's theory of logical probability (degree of confirmation) contained in his monumental Logical Foundations of Probability.16 In the systems of inductive logic he elaborated in that book, one begins with a formalized language and assigns a priori weights to all statements in that language, including, of course, all hypotheses. It is very easy to show that Carnap's theory of confirmation is thoroughly Bayesian, with the a priori the probability calculus, to offer an introductory Bayesian account of the confirmation of hypotheses. 10 Chicago : University of Chicago Press, 1950. 82 BA YES' S THEOREM AND THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE weights functioning precisely as the prior probabilities in Bayes's theorem. Although these systems had the awkward feature that general hypotheses all have prior probabilities, and consequently, posterior probabilities on any finite amount of evidence, equal to zero, Jaakko Hintikka has shown how this difficulty can be circumvented without fundamentally altering Carnap's conception of confirmation as a logical probability.17 2. Although not many exponents of the frequency theory of probability will agree that it even makes sense to talk a bout the probability of scientific hypotheses, those who do explicitly invoke Bayes's theorem for that pur- pose. Reichenbach is the leading figure in this school, although his treat- ment of the probability of hypotheses is unfortunately quite obscure in many important respects.18 I have tried to clarify some of the basic points of misunderstanding. 19 3. The important \"Bayesian\" approach to the foundations of statistics has become increasingly influential since the publication in 1954 of L. J. Savage's The Foundations of Statistics.20 It has gained many adherents among philosophers as well as statisticians. This view is based upon a sub- jective interpretation of probability (\"personal probability,\" as Savage pre- fers to say, in order to avoid confusion with earlier subjective interpreta- tions), and it makes extensive use of Bayes' s theorem. The prior proba- bilities are simply degrees of prior belief in the hypothesis, before the con- crete evidence is available. The fact that the prior probabilities are so easily interpreted on this view means that Bayes's theorem is always available for 11se. Savage, himself, is not especially concerned with probabilities of gen- eral hypotheses, but those who are interested in such matters have a ready- 111acle Bayesian theory of confirmation.21 On this view, the prior probabili- 1 ics are subjective plausibility judgments. 4.

Wesley C. Salmon that there is more to confirmation than mere confirming instances.22 He attempts to circumvent the difficulties, which are essentially those con- nected with the H-D schema, by introducing the notion of \"entrench- ment\" of terms that occur in hypotheses. Recognizing that a good deal of the experience of the human race becomes embedded in the languages we use, he brings this information to bear upon hypotheses that are candi- dates for confirmation. Although he never mentions Bayes's theorem or prior probabilities, the chapter in which he presents his solution can be read as a tract on the Bayesian approach to confirmation. 5. Sir Karl Popper rejects entirely the notions of confirmation and in- ductive logic.23 His concept of corroboration, however, plays a central role in his theory of scientific methodology. Although corroboration is explicit- ly regarded as non probabilistic, it does offer a measure of how well a scien- tific hypothesis has stood up to tests. The measure of corroboration in- volves such factors as simplicity, content, and testability of hypotheses, as well as the seriousness of the attempts made to falsify them by experiment. Although Popper denies that a highly corroborated hypothesis is highly probable, the highly corroborated hypothesis does enjoy a certain status: it may be chosen over its less corroborated fellows for further testing, and if practical needs arise, it may be used for purposes of prediction. The im- portant point, for the present discussion, is that Popper rejects the H-D schema, and introduces additional factors into his methodology that play a role somewhat analogous to our plausibility considerations. The foregoing survey of major contemporary schools of thought on the logic of scientific confirmation strongly suggests not only that the naive H-D schema is not universaIIy accepted nowadays by inductive logicians as an adequate characterization of the logic of scientific inference, but also that it is not even a serious candidate for that role. Given the wide popular acceptance of the H-D method, it seems entirely possible that significant numbers of historians of science may be accepting a view of confirmation that is known to be inadequate, and one which differs from the current serious contending views in ways that can have a profound influence upon historical judgments. It seems, therefore, that the branch of contempo- 22 First edition (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1955); second edition (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1965). 23 The Logic of Scientific Discovery (New York: Basic Books, 1959). It is to he noted that, in spite of the title of his book, Popper accepts the distin ction between discovery and justification, and explicitly declares that he is concerned with the latter bnt not th e former. 84 BAYES'S THEOREM AND THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE rary philosophy of science that deals with inductive logic and confirmation theory may have some substantive material that is highly relevant to the professional activities of the historian of science. It is fair to say, I believe, that one of the most basic points on which the leading contemporary theories of confirmation differ from one another is with regard to the nature of the prior probabilities. As already indicated, the logical theorist takes the prior probability as an a priori assessment of the hypothesis, the personalist takes the prior probability as a measure of subjective plausibility, the frequentist must look at the prior probability as some sort of success frequency for a certain type of hypothesis, Good- man would regard the prior probability as somehow based upon linguistic usage, and Popper (though he violently objects to regarding it as a prior probability) needs something like the potential explanatory value of the hypothesis. In addition, I should remark, N. R. Hanson held plausibility arguments to belong to the logic of discovery, but I have argued that, on his own analysis, they have an indispensable role in the logic of justifica- tion.24 This is not the place to go into a lengthy analysis of the virtues and shortcomings of the various views on the nature of prior probabilities.25 Rather, I should like merely to point out a consequence of my view that is quite germane to the topic of the conference. If one adopts a frequency view of probability, and attempts to deal with the logic of confirmation by way of Bayes's theorem (as I do), then he is committed to regarding the prior probability as some sort of frequency-e.g., the frequency with which hypotheses relevantly similar to the one under consideration have en- joyed significant scientific success. Surely no one would claim that we have reliable statistics on such matters, or that we can come anywhere near assigning precise numerical values in a meaningful way. Fortunately, that lnrns out to be unnecessary; it is enough to have very, very rough estimates. l\\nt this approach does suggest that the question of the plausibility of a ~cientific hypothesis has something to do with our experience in dealing wit-h scientific hypotheses of similar types. Thus, I should say, the reason I would place a rather low plausibility value on teleological hypotheses is closely related to our experience in the transitions from teleological to me- clt:mical explanations in the physical and biological sciences and, to some extent, in the social sciences. To turn back toward telelogical hypotheses \" 1101111dalions of Scie11tific Jnfcrencc, pp. 111-114, ll 8. \"' This is don e in 1-hc items mc11tioned in footnote 10. 85 Wesley C. Salmon would be to go against a great deal of scientific experience about what kinds of hypotheses work well scientifically. Similarly, when Watson and Crick were enraptured with the beauty of the double helix hypothesis for the structure of the DNA molecule, I believe their reaction was more than purely esthetic.26 Experience indicated that hypotheses of that degree of simplicity tend to be successful, and they were inferring that it had not only beauty, but a good chance of being correct. Additional examples could easily be exhibited. If I am right in claiming not only that prior probabilities constitute an indispensable ingredient in the confirmation of hypotheses and the con- text of justification, but also that our estimates of them are based upon empirical experience with scientific hypothesizing, then it is evident that the history of science plays a crucial, but largely unheralded, role in the current scientific enterprise. The history of science is, after all, a chronicle of our past experience with scientific hypothesizing and theorizing-with learning what sorts of hypotheses work and what sorts do not. Without the Bayesian analysis, one could say that the study of the history of science might have some (at least marginal) heuristic value for the scientist and philosopher of science, but on the Bayesian analysis, the data provided by the history of science constitute, in addition, an essential segment of the evidence relevant to the confirmation or disconfirmation of hypotheses. Philosophers of science and creative scientists ignore this fact at their peril. 2• James D. Watson, The Double Helix (New York: New American Library, 1969) . This book provides a fascinating account of the discovery of an important scientific hy- pothesis, and it illustrates many of the points I have been making. Perhaps if literary re- viewers had had a clearer grasp of the distinction between the context of discovery and the context of justification they would have been less shocked at the emotions reported in the narrative. 86 -----PETER ACHINSTEIN----- Inference to Scientific Laws The topic of inference to scientific laws is one to which, I believe, both philosophers of science and historians of science can contribute to their mutual benefit. This is by no means self-evident, and indeed has been denied by philosophers as well as historians. There is even a view that there is no such topic at all to discuss. The view, held by proponents of the hypo- thetico-deductive (H-D) picture of science, is that there are no inferences to laws, only from them. The scientist does not infer a law from the data. He invents it, guesses it, imagines it, and then derives consequences from it which he tests. For example, Popper, one of the foremost proponents of this view, speaks of theories, including laws, as \"free creations of our own minds, the result of an almost poetic intuition,\" and he rejects the idea that they are inferred in any way from observations.1 Again, in a recent work, Hempel writes: \"The transition from data to theory requires crea- tive imagination. Scientific hypotheses are not derived from observed facts, hut invented in order to account for them. They constitute guesses at the connections that might obtain between the phenomena under study. . •• \" 2 The physicist Feynman agrees. He writes : \"In general we look for a new law by the following process. First we guess it. Then we compute the consequences of the guess to see what would be implied if this law that we g11cssed is right. Then we compare the result of the computation to nature . .. to see if it works. If it disagrees with experiment it is wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science.\" 3 According to the H-D view scientists do not make inferences to laws, '11T1101t's NOTE: This paper contains in abbreviated form some material from chapters 6 11 11d 7 of my Law and Explanation in Science, to be published.
