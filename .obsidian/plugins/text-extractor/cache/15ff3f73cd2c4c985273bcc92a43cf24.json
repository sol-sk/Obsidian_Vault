The sample scored 10% better on the final exam, 75%, compared to her population of past students. The standard deviation of her sample was 14%. What was the effect size for this teaching technique? First, what Cohen’s d should we use? 14 !𝑑 = $𝑋 − µ 𝑠 !𝑑 = 75 − 65 14 = 0.71 Calculating Cohen’s \"𝑑 • An instructor tested a new teaching technique on a sample of 20 students last year. The sample scored 10% better on the final exam, 75%, compared to her population of past students. The standard deviation of her sample was 14%. What was the effect size for this teaching technique? 15 !𝑑 = $𝑋 − µ 𝑠 !𝑑 = 𝟕𝟓 − 𝟔𝟓 𝟏𝟒 = 0.71 Calculating t- & p-values • An instructor tested a new teaching technique on a sample of 20 students last year. The sample scored 10% better on the final exam compared to her population of past students. The standard deviation of her sample was 14%. Is this effect statistically reliable? 16 𝑡\"#$ = $𝑋\"#$ − µ 𝑠 %& 𝑠 %& = 𝑠 𝑁 Calculating t- & p-values • An instructor tested a new teaching technique on a sample of 20 students last year.
