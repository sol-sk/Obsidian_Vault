Standardize (z-score) X & Y 2. Plot ZX~ZY 3. Calculate r Spearman rs 1. Rank X & Y 2. Plot Xrank~Yrank 3. Calculate rs How do they ‘see’ data? 10 Unstandardized regression uses raw data (w/original units) Pearson r uses standardized data (z-scores) Spearman rs uses ranked data Prediction using Models (harry_learns.omv) • We use models to simplify our data, and to make predictions – We’ve already covered many prediction models • Let’s predict using statistical models!! 11 Data Characteristics 1213 Single variable plot: Seconds to complete puzzle 14 N = 40 trials Single variable plot: Seconds to complete puzzle 15 N = 40 trials Standard Deviation of the sample Single variable plot: Seconds to complete puzzle 16 Scatterplot: Seconds to complete puzzle by number of puzzle encounters Scatterplot: Seconds to complete puzzle by number of puzzle encounters 17 Standard Error of the Estimate sy|x Scatterplot: Seconds to complete puzzle by number of puzzle encounters Linear model Y’ 18 Scatterplot: Seconds to complete puzzle by number of puzzle encounters Scatterplot: Seconds to complete puzzle by number of puzzle encounters Non-linear model Y’ 19 New concept: Standard Error of the MODEL Scatterplot: Seconds to complete puzzle by number of puzzle encounters Inference 2021 Standard Error of the MEAN What do you think? 22 Inferential Statistics Starts This Week!","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
