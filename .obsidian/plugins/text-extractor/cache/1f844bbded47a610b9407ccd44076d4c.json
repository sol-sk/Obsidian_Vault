Evaluating Conspiracy Theories Note that there is something odd going on with respect to the way “conspiracy theory” is used: Principle of compositionality: the meaning of complex terms is a function of the meanings of their constituent terms and rules for combining terms If we apply this principle, we get something like this: Conspiracy-some group of agents works in secret to achieve some goal Theory-a proposed explanation for some phenomenon So, a conspiracy theory would be a theory that proposes a conspiracy as an explanation for some phenomenon This is what the term meant when it was initially introduced in forensic contexts. 19th c, “the conspiracy theory of the case...” But that is not how the term is typically used today...
