Some of these chapters are looong. Zoom event: Thursday, Sept 14, 12:30 6 Learning objectives ▪ By the end of this lesson, you will be able to: ▫ Understand the fundamental tenets of science ▫ Explain, differentiate between, and generate examples for various forms of logical reasoning ▫ Properly interpret relations between data and hypotheses ▫ Explain how the scientific method relates to critical thinking 78 How do we know what we know? Ways of Knowing Scientific method “Unscientific” (non-data-driven) methods Experience Folk wisdom/ common sense Authority IntuitionLogic 9 Cannons of Science Canons of Science Determinism Empiricism Parsimony Testability 10 Determinism ▪ The assumption that the universe is orderly ▪ Events occur due to some meaningful and systematic cause ▪ Foundation of research 11 Empiricism ▪ We understand the world by making structured, systematic observations ▪ Making such observations is best way to figure out orderly principles 12 Parsimony ▪ When two theories can explain the same set of empirical observations, preference  simpler ▪ Forces scientists to make as few assumptions as possible ▪ aka Occam’s Razor 13 Testability ▪ Researchers should be able to put scientific theories to empirical tests ▪ It is particularly important that theories are falsifiable 14 Goals of Psychological Science ▪ Describe behaviour ▪ Predict behaviour ▪ Determine causes of behaviour ▪ Understand/Explain behaviour ▪ Apply knowledge to solve problems Basic Research Applied Research 15 When “Science”ing… ▪ We examine theories, hypotheses, and predictions 16 Terms defined Theory Overarching framework that organises and explains phenomena and data Generates hypotheses that test boundaries of the theory Hypothesis A tentative statement about a relationship that may or may not be true Prediction Specific statement regarding the expected outcome of a study 17 Terms defined • Every time anyone eats peanuts, their throats will swell up Theory/General expectation Hypothesis Observation Every time I eat peanuts, my throat swells up (Note: Noticing a series of events) The next time I eat peanuts, my throat will continue to swell up 18 Terms defined – Anemia – Lung cancer – Vitamin B12 deficiency – COVID – Acute stress What the heck happened? Observation Patient presents with shortness of breath, headache, fatigue Not trying to create theory 19 Example study ▪ Theory: ▫ Human behaviour is a function of their life experience and exposure to stimuli in their environment ■ Builds on previous research ▪ Hypothesis: ▫ After playing violent games rather than non-violent games, one will become more aggressive even long after the game is over 20 Video games study ▪ Basic study design – Methods Bushman & Gibson, 2010 18 19 20 54.7645.24 Participants N = 169 21 Video game study ▪ Violent games: ▪ Non-violent games ▪Basic study design Bushman & Gibson, 2010","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
