Wounded Knee featured a seventy-one-day siege, the mobili- zation of the American military against Indian ac- tivists, and copious media reportage; and it came on the heels of the 1972 takeover of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, D.C., the seizure and occu- pation of Alcatraz Island (1969–1971), and several best-selling books on Indian activism.

In 2016, Indians reappeared once again. The occasion was the near-completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,100-mile, 30-inch pipe built to carry oil from the Bak- ken Fields of North Dakota to a terminal in Illinois. Passing about one-half mile north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, the pipe would run underneath the Mis- souri River, jeopardizing the Tribe’s wa- ter source; and it turned out that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which had ju- risdiction over the land, had failed to ade- quately consult the Tribe. The protests did not follow the patterns of the sixties and early seventies. Over the course of the spring and summer, a small prayer camp on the Standing Rock reser- vation grew into a vast protest city, with as many as ten thousand people occupy- ing several camps. Lakota and Dakota peo- ples were joined by Indigenous peoples from across North America and around the world, as well as environmental activists and allies from a range of other social jus- tice groups. Some came for a weekend; oth- ers committed to a long stay. The pipeline had been rerouted away from the city of Bismarck, North Dakota, in what seemed to be a clear case of environmental rac- ism: the willing endangerment of an Indi- an community in order to distance a White community from danger. For environmen- talists, the protest against Dakota Access was also part of a three-pronged strategy: trying to slow production, trying to change patterns of consumption, and trying to re- duce oil infrastructure. They relished the opportunity to reprise their success in stop- ping the Keystone XL pipeline in 2015. Beginning in the late summer and ex- tending throughout the fall, the protests were met with an astonishing display of militarized police power. Camouflage, gas mask, and body armor–wearing, AK-47- toting private guards, North Dakota law en- forcement, and National Guardsmen faced down protesters. Unlike Wounded Knee, which had relied upon a now-simple world of network television coverage, Standing Rock was a viral story. It featured a prolif- eration of social media images document- ing both the substance of the camps them- selves–mostly spiritual and pacifist–and the dog attacks, teargassings, and bean-bag and rubber-bullet shootings that were be- ing launched by the authorities. A legal and political effort accompanied the camps. The legal story was marked by events that unfolded far from Stand- ing Rock: federal court decisions in Wash- ington, D.C., requests to halt construction from cabinet departments, a December 2016 revocation of the pipeline’s permit, and, in June 2017, a federal court ruling that the Army Corps of Engineers had failed to conduct an adequate and consultative en- vironmental study in relation to Sioux trea- ty rights. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe rightly claimed a kind of victory. But the pipeline was in full operation by then, and the judge refused to shut it down on what seemed to be mostly procedural matters. “Victory” seemed to belong in quotation marks, as the oil has continued to flow. As scholars interested in the past, pres- ent, and future of Indigenous peoples in the United States and the world, we watched the events at Standing Rock and extracted lessons. Most non-Native people we talked with about the occupation could agree on the significance of sacred places, or the spiritual and environmental importance of clean, safe water, or perhaps arguments about cultural patrimony and history. These were the familiar tropes associated with the “American Indian.” Most non-Native peo- ple also knew that it all had something to do with broken treaties–because there al- ways is a story about a broken treaty. It is a hook on which hangs a vague feeling of This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000207.194.177.233 on Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:47:51 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 8 Dædalus, the Journal of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences Unfolding Futures: Indigenous Ways of Knowing for the Twenty- First Century national guilt, a well-meaning expression of sympathy, and a sad sense of the inevi- tability of it all. Understanding the intricacies of the rel- evant treaties (1851 and 1868), agreements (1877 and 1889), executive orders (1875), and countless legal cases, laws, and administra- tive protocols proved challenging, even for the most dedicated advocates. They were confused by the shifting boundaries be- tween treaties, by the provisions for ap- proval of subsequent agreements, and by the possibility that not all Lakota and Da- kota people had consented to the treaty in 1868. It was all quite complicated. Media consumers were moved, however, by the images of young Indian people on horseback (sometimes painted), of tipi lodges jutting from the tent city, and of the magical day when bison appeared from over a hilltop and ran past the camp. Most observers had a picture of Indian people in their minds that did not align with con- temporary Indian lives. Sympathetic view- ers tended to latch on to images that evoked the past; they struggled to know the pres- ent and did not think overlong about the fu- ture. They did not know what they did not know about Indigenous life, and they could not begin to imagine Indian people leading non-Native America in any way. As usual, they assumed that Indians would, at best, reluctantly follow along into whatever it is that comes next. But the images were part of a leading-edge Indian politics with lessons for everyone’s future. Pictures of painted faces, horses, bi- son, lodges, and landscapes often reflect- ed self-aware strategic essentialisms meant to drive politically powerful narratives that demanded engagement. They were beamed to the world via social media; indeed, one might argue that the occupation garnered much of its energy from a social media cam- paign launched by Native activists. The campaign went global, even as it recruited allies and partners with resources and net- works of their own. A small prayer camp turned into an international cause. In August 2016, as Standing Rock was heating up, six of us–Bryan Brayboy, Mark Trahant, Loren Ghiglione, Douglas Medin, Ned Blackhawk, and Philip Deloria–met at the American Academy of Arts and Scienc- es with a group of American Indian schol- ars and thought leaders. Although she was unable to attend that meeting, coeditor K. Tsianina Lomawaima quickly took on a lead role in the conversation. Together, we have followed in the footsteps of generations of other Indian thinkers: we tried to puzzle out this moment in time, when Indigenous peo- ples are crafting a new environmental-social- political alliance and new strategies for po- litical action, while simultaneously being written out of much of contemporary life. This erasure, as Stephanie Fryberg noted at the meeting, is a particular form of modern racism directed at the Indigenous, though it has consequences for all. The epigraphs at the beginning of this essay–all uttered at that meeting–frame the issues well: Indian people continue to suffer from widespread ignorance and an assumption of their past- ness. Shelly Lowe went so far as to frame that ignorance in Rumsfeldian terms: Americans did not have an inkling of what they did not know. Our mission was clear: to understand the contemporary dynamics of this modern rac ism and to try to create positive change in academia, in the legal system, among gov- ernment and nonprofit actors, and in the in- tellectual and cultural life of the nation. Those conversations at the American Academy helped shape and support this issue of Dædalus, which we have titled “Unfolding Futures: Indigenous Ways of Knowing for the Twenty-First Century.” In this volume, you will find serious reflection on many questions most important to In- dian Country and the broader Indigenous world.

We have organized the issue around key themes, and each essay will touch on one or more of these points: 1) Indians are unique–they are not simply another minority, but have a formal legal and political status in the United States; 2) Indian people are sovereign–they have collective rights to self-determination and self-governance; and 3) Indian people are central–they occupy a position at the very heart of critical issues spanning energy and bioethics to climate change. Finally, read- ers will note the consistent thematic ostina- to: Indian people are engaged with history, to be sure, but they should not be viewed in terms of the past, but through the lens of futurity. In Article I of the U.S. Constitution, the famous “three-fifths” clause outlines four categories of people: citizens, indentured servants, “all other persons” (the nonref- erence to African American slaves), and a fourth group, “Indians not taxed.” An Indi- an person paying taxes to the U.S. govern- ment would have presumably given up a different, non-U.S. form of citizenship, one based in a tribal nation. Because they were part of their own nations, Indians would be neither taxed nor counted for purposes of representation in the United States. They were members of foreign nations, in oth- er words. That sensibility was reinforced in the Commerce Clause, in which Congress is given the power “to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the sever- al States, and with the Indian Tribes.” Here, the word “among” signals the internal na- ture of the states, while the word “with” suggests the external quality of both for- eign nations and Indian Tribes. In key passages of the Constitution, then, Indi- an Tribes are framed as being outside the Constitution. And, for Indian people, that fact has long suggested the importance of a third passage, the controlling logic found in Article Six–the Supremacy Clause–which names three bodies of law as supreme: the Constitution itself, the laws passed by Con- gress, and the treaties negotiated with ex- ternal political bodies. As inherent sovereigns, Native nations have for millennia exercised the preroga- tives of self-government, self-determina- tion, and self-education within their territo- rial land base. Settler colonial incursion and dispossession have constrained, but not ex- tinguished Indigenous sovereignty (though not for lack of trying). The United States has extended its claims over Indigenous peo- ples–and more than one billion acres of land–through a complex interweaving of military force, diplomatic negotiation, and instruments such as treaties, as well as the unilateral assertion of jurisdiction and gov- ernance through legislation, executive or- ders, and court rulings. Some of those rulings effectively estab- lished a different relationship–not rooted in autochthonous Indigenous political au- tonomy and a concomitant diplomacy, but in what has come to be known as the “trust relationship.” As a principle of law and na- tionhood, the trust relationship embodies the responsibilities of the federal govern- ment–as both the taker and the recipient of Indian lands–to provide basic services to Native people. Many treaties and agree- ments stipulate educational and health ser- vices as federal responsibilities to Native nations; even when not so stipulated, these services are embodied through the trust re- lationship. The legal landscape of trust has been muddied by Supreme Court dicta (that is, opinion, not ruling) in the case of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831), when Chief Justice John Marshall, in a burst of legal creativity, stated that the relation of Indians to the United States “resembles that of a ward to This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000207.194.177.233 on Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:47:51 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 10 Dædalus, the Journal of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences Unfolding Futures: Indigenous Ways of Knowing for the Twenty- First Century his guardian” (emphasis added).2 A guard- ian’s powers over a ward are much more ex- pansive and less constrained by law than the powers of a trustee over a beneficiary, and, over time, federal powers over Indians have frequently developed entirely unchecked.3 American Indians were consigned to the status of wards for nearly a century, from Marshall’s convenient articulation of the resemblance until Congress passed the Amer- ican Indian Citizenship Act in 1924, con- ferring birthright citizenship on all Indi- ans born within the territorial limits of the United States. Quite a few Indians (perhaps as many as two-thirds) were already citi- zens, naturalized through treaty, Congres- sional legislation, or other mechanisms.4 For so many Americans–the formerly enslaved or the immigrant–citizenship of- fered a path to civil rights, security, and em- powerment. And Indian people too have rec- ognized some of the advantages of U.S. citi- zenship (access to courts, for example). But in two decisions (U.S. v. Sandoval, 1913, and U.S. v. Nice, 1916), the U.S. Supreme Court also found that, for Indians, citizenship was not incompatible with wardship, and all of the federal powers and controls concomi- tant to it. The federal government, as a trust- ee, styles itself as the theoretical caretaker of Native assets and peoples, although, in real- ity, federal powers have more times than not stripped Native lands of resources and Na- tive peoples of both land and wealth.5 The issue commences with a consider- ation of the concept of sovereignty: its origins, its contested meanings, and the way it po- sitions American Indian people as unique within the political, economic, social, cul- tural, ethical, and administrative fabric of the United States. How did Indian sov- ereignty emerge historically, even as the United States introduced other concepts– “domestic dependency,” “guardian-ward” relationships, and “plenary power”–that worked to limit Indian self-determination? Is sovereignty a Western concept, hopelessly contaminated by colonialism? Or is it a necessary and powerful tool in the service of tribal nations, now and in the future? Is it an inherent right that predates the U.S. Constitution? How might Indian people reimagine Indigenous sovereignty in the twenty-first century? Heidi Kiiwetinepine- siik Stark and Kekek Jason Stark frame their discussion through a Nenabozho story–an Objiwe trickster tale–that illuminates key questions: immanency, popular sovereign- ty, and the constant dialectical assertion and resistance surrounding legal and adminis- trative structures (such as those demanding that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ad- equately consult the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe). Placing the trickster Nenabozho in an ice-fishing shack, Stark and Stark offer both a philosophical narrative stressing re- lationality among living beings, including sovereign nations, and a case study ground- ed in sovereignty struggles involving treaty- based Ojibwe fishing rights. Paradoxically, the exercise of tribal sov- ereignty rests, in some measure, on the rec- ognition of a tribe by the federal govern- ment. Currently, there are 567 tribes with federal recognition, with many others en- meshed in the complex and difficult process of petitioning for acknowledgment; others are recognized by states, but not the feder- al government. Amy Den Ouden’s essay tracks a complex history of recognition ef- forts on the part of the Golden Hill Paugus- sett Tribe of Connecticut. Focusing on ef- forts in the early 1970s to navigate both state politics and federal recognition, Den Ouden reveals the ways in which racialization and erasure of the Native fundamentally shaped the discussion. Observers questioned Con- necticut Indians’ “African” looks as some- how compromising Native political iden- tity, even as legislators cracked jokes about dead Indians and “Indian givers,” and re- sisted the Paugussett’s bid for federal recog- nition, which was rejected in 2004, leaving This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000207.194.177.233 on Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:47:51 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 147 (2) Spring 2018 11 Deloria, Lomawaima, Brayboy, Trahant, Ghiglione, Medin & Blackhawk them a state-recognized tribe, a status con- firmed in a 2009 legal challenge. Recognition, which rests fundamentally on history, reveals a wide range of histori- cally specific relations among Indian peo- ples and colonizers. The cases of Alaska and Hawai‘i highlight that diversity, while step- ping out of a purely continental perspective. Alaska’s Indigenous peoples survived Rus- sian colonization (1784) and then watched as their lands were “purchased” by the Unit- ed States in 1867. As Rosita Kaaháni Worl and Heather Kendall-Miller suggest, this history produced a unique land claim settle- ment strategy as Alaska moved from territo- ry to state, and oil producers sought first to drill and then to build the Alaska pipeline. The settlement laid a new economic and po- litical form–the Native corporation–over Indigenous life and politics. How were the Alaska Native peoples to navigate political sovereignty over tribal members and land and to establish relations with the federal government? A complex legal and legisla- tive history underpins the contemporary re- lation between the corporation, the tribe, and the government, but it confirms both sovereign status and trust responsibilities. Hawai‘i, as Noelani Goodyear-Ka‘ōpua and Bryan Kamaoli Kuwada make clear, is the product of a very different kind of colo- nial, imperial, and Indigenous history, one defined only partially by American global, mercantile, and military interests, and more important, by an ongoing sovereignty not readily captured by federal recognition practices. Indeed, their essay focuses on a 2014 Department of Interior plan to cre- ate a process pathway to federal recogni- tion for a Native Hawaiian political entity. Hundreds of Kānaka Maoli protested, not- ing the clear distinctions between Native America and Native Hawai‘i, and insisting on an identity not only ethnic or geograph- ic, but also national, in ways that demand- ed connection to the independent King- dom of Hawai‘i that exercised authority for most of the nineteenth century. Using a Kanaka Maoli epistemology focused on the making of ‘aha, or rope, Goodyear-Ka‘ōpua and Kuwada argue for a political vision that braids past and present together to gener- ate a new claim on futurity. In these cases, the United States has sought to erase both Indigenous peoples’ rights and the nation’s concomitant responsibilities to recognize, support, and fulfill those rights. As Amy Den Ouden’s essay affirms, tribes are not racial collectives, but political/legal ones, which means that they exercise the right to define their own citizenship. Even as outsiders frame Indian identities racial- ly, so too do tribes themselves. One of the main ways that tribal citizenship has been defined has been through the racial mark- er of blood, handed down from the Ameri- can assimilation policies of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the form of blood quantum membership requirements. “Indian blood” is a metaphorical thing that has often taken the concrete form of genea- logical math. How many quarters or eighths or sixteenths blood does one have? What if your parents are from two different tribes? How much blood do you need to be enrolled as a citizen? The advent of genetic testing has opened up new questions about identi- ty and ethics, which are the subject of Nan- ibaa’ Garrison’s essay. Indigenous peoples’ genetic material ends up being coveted by researchers, even as new industries offer the average person a chance to “prove” Native ancestry and thus constitute a particular claim to identity, and perhaps even a claim on tribal enrollment. In this sense, Garrison observes, Indian people are central to con- temporary bioethical debates that extend far beyond the question of tribal member- ship or research protocol. Garrison’s essay highlights the complex interworkings and linkages between the social, political, cul- tural, and genetic nature of Native identity. This fetish to “be Indian” dates back to the founding of the United States, and is This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000207.194.177.233 on Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:47:51 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 12 Dædalus, the Journal of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences Unfolding Futures: Indigenous Ways of Knowing for the Twenty- First Century visible in the tortured inversions of the “one drop rule”: if one drop of African blood taints the Whitest person as “Black,” then, at the same time, one drop of Indian blood will (often happily) make the Whit- est person “Indian.” That desire to appro- priate noble Indians has long been paired with its opposite: the denigration of Indian “savagery,” “backwardness,” and “inabil- ity.” Contemporary psychological research on the connections among culture, institu- tions, and individuals reveals the cumula- tive negative effects of such stereotypes, as both Indians and non-Indians internalize beliefs, constitute identities, and then make them material through actions and inter- actions. And yet, as Arianne Eason, Laura Brady, and Stephanie Fryberg argue, the same cycles can be changed through con- centrated interventions. Indian people, they suggest, offer a critical point of cen- trality for the timeless challenge of driving cultural change in socially positive ways. As stereotyped images linger from the past and fuel negative outcomes in the pres- ent–such as the disproportionate remov- al of children from Native families–they can also be transformed in ways to help pro- duce Indigenous futures. Efforts on the part of Indian people to drive positive cultural belief systems among non-Native Americans invert an earlier campaign: that of White Americans to erad- icate Native language, culture, social prac- tice, and collective identity. These assimi- lation policies took shape around military power and physical containment on res- ervations, religious transformation, and a boarding school program that brutally sup- pressed the very notion of Indianness and Indigenous systems of education. As Bryan McKinley Jones Brayboy and K. Tsianina Lomawaima point out, the legacy of that schooling practice remains with Indian peo- ple to this day, often in the form of multi- generational historical trauma. At the same time, however, schooling also helped fos- ter intertribal solidarities and created new conditions for political organizing and cul- tural reassertion. Today, the possibility for education and schooling to be simpatico– instead of in tension–is more profoundly possible. It is the future. If closing the gap in K–12 education of- fers a vital goal for Indian Country and the United States as a whole, it is also the case that tribal colleges have stepped into the breach, not simply as educational in- stitutions, but as cultural and community centers and powerful collectives that fuse spirituality with institutional structure in novel ways. Today, thirty-seven tribal col- leges and universities effectively serve over twenty thousand Native and non-Native rural students. As Cheryl Crazy Bull and Justin Guillory suggest, the tribal college movement indexes a critical expression of tribal futurity, offering culture-centered training in fields that are locally impor- tant, educationally traditional, and emer- gent with new possibilities for Indian cul- tures and economies. Nor are tribal colleges the only institu- tional locations to be indigenized by Na- tive peoples. Museums, for example, have long offered simplistic representations of American Indians, and often served as re- positories for Indigenous human remains and cultural patrimony. Two critical in- terventions–the founding of the Nation- al Museum of the American Indian (1989) and the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (1990)–helped transform museum prac- tice today. As Philip J. Deloria suggests, the decades that followed that legislation saw an explosion of excellent tribal museums and an increase in tribal capacity in both repatriation and cultural affairs. As the National Museum of the American Indi- an refreshes its permanent galleries over the next five years, it will explicitly argue for Native peoples’ centrality in the Amer- This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000207.194.177.233 on Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:47:51 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 147 (2) Spring 2018 13 Deloria, Lomawaima, Brayboy, Trahant, Ghiglione, Medin & Blackhawk ican story, and insist not only on survival narratives, but also on Indigenous futurity. In that future, Indian people face many challenges, including the long-standing is- sue of health and wellness of tribal mem- bers. As Mark Trahant recounts, the federal obligation to Indian health care has its ori- gins in treaties, most of which provided for doctors and, in some cases, hospital care. A long history of poor performance, lack of funding, and socioeconomic inequity has produced significant health disparities be- tween Native and other populations. And yet, as Trahant argues, in the years follow- ing the 1976 passage of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, the Indian Health Service has closed a substantial number of health disparity gaps. One major feature in that success has been contracting out to tribal service providers. Trahant observes that, precisely because they are still under- funded, many of the successful operations under the Indian Health Service actually offer prototypes for thinking about new forms of service delivery at a lower cost. In dealing with chronic underfunding, the Indian Health Service may find itself in a leadership role. Indian people have long histories of lead- ership. As Gary Sandefur and Philip J. De- loria suggest, White Americans have often misread that history in terms of military resistance, creating a kind of “great man” understanding of Indian history. Leader- ship, Sandefur and Deloria argue, has been far more diverse: it has included women in important ways, flowed through colonial institutions such as the church, and tak- en shape in both local-tribal contexts and national intertribal organizations. Indi- an leadership has been adaptive, even as it has served as an important location for per- sistent assertions of cultural autonomy and self-determination. Like health services delivery, Indian leadership has not been without challenges, but it has also offered important models for the United States, a nation fixated on leadership education that sometimes struggles to produce effective and ethical leaders. Likewise, as Kyle Whyte suggests, Indian people offer both knowledge and leadership in understanding and addressing environ- mental crises. Whyte surveys a wide range of literature to identify an emergent field of Indigenous Environmental Science Studies (iess) that seeks to take seriously the rela- tionality, spirituality, and Traditional En- vironmental Knowledge (tek). Whyte ar- gues that Indigenous knowledge is science and has functioned as such in both past and present. But his is not an essentialist claim to privilege the Indigenous. For Whyte, the dialectical partnership between tek and mainstream science offers the most po- tential for Native and non-Native futures in the face of climate change and ecolog- ical disaster. Megan Bang, Ananda Marin, and Doug- las Medin insist on a plurality of sciences, in ways that question the singular hegemony of Western science and make room for In- digenous sciences as both a powerful prac- tice of knowledge-making in its own right and an important partner in a multisided scientific exchange of knowledge. And yet, the authors insist on a reciprocal and ethi- cal relationship. It is not simply the case that Indigenous knowledge ought to be available to the full sweep of science; too often that has meant appropriation and new practic- es of colonial domination. Indigenous peo- ples insist that they will stand with the sci- ences, particularly in our moment of plane- tary crisis. They would simply like to know that scientists from all disciplines will stand with them as well. If American Indian people–alive, active, and innovative in the present moment–of- fer possibilities to others in terms of polit- ical movements, representational politics, the production of scientific knowledge, the ethics of bioscience, and the management of institutions, it is also the case that main- This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000207.194.177.233 on Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:47:51 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 14 Dædalus, the Journal of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences Unfolding Futures: Indigenous Ways of Knowing for the Twenty- First Century taining self-determining tribal vitality and identity remains the key priority in Indi- an Country. Perhaps nowhere is that pri- ority so challenged and so rich with possi- bility as in the question of language preser- vation and awakening. As Teresa McCarty, Sheilah Nicholas, Kari Chew, Natalie Diaz, Wesley Leonard, and Louellyn White argue, language reclamation fuses pasts, presents, and futures, even as it refuses colonizing imperatives for assimilation and disappear- ance. Language, they suggest, is central to individual and community well-being and sustainability, and to the larger claim to so- cial justice. To that end, language repatria- tion will be one of the most significant goals for the Indigenous future. The claim to social justice is central to the essays in this issue, as is the relation among past, present, and future. The United States has struggled to turn from old master narra- tives to new histories relevant to its present and future. In those old stories, Indians nec- essarily had to disappear. For the Puritans to found a City on the Hill–a story often framed as an American claim to religious freedom–Indians had to die, leaving their food and land behind; their disappearance was a sign from God. In the story of frontier settlement, Indians became part of nature, fleeing westward and then just vanishing, according to some conveniently imagined “law of nature.” In the story of Europe- an immigration, Indians were already as- sumed to be gone, their land simply avail- able. In stories of the Civil War, Americans ignored Indians altogether, focused on the White-on-White bloodletting that would redeem the original sin of slavery. And even in the great contemporary counternarra- tive of African American struggles to move from slavery to freedom to civil rights, In- dian histories and peoples find little trac- tion. Americans don’t tend to tell stories in ways that leave room for Indian people. In- deed, the nation has, in many ways, come to see slavery as America’s primary–or per- haps only–original sin, and national con- versations on race, inequity, and the hurts of history tend to occur around a Black/ White binary. But slavery required the tak- ing of Indigenous land and the removal of Indigenous people. The United States was founded on dispossession. The stories of settler colonial conquest and slavery are in- terrelated and inextricable, and we should never forget it. Land lies forever at the heart of Amer- ica’s problem with Indians. The United States and the American dream–of free- dom, democracy, a divine mandate to lead the world–are built on Indian land. Even by U.S. standards of law (often transparently self-serving), the history of “title transfer” for too much of that land has a rotten smell. It would be so much easier for the nation to congratulate itself if its claims to its territo- rial land base were more secure. And so American settlement histories are of necessity deeply ideological. They frame Indian peoples around two distinct modes of disappearance: Indians can simply die or vanish; or they can assimilate into America, disappearing as distinct peoples into some vast melting pot. Americans have worked hard to bring both visions to pass. But in ev- ery one of those narratives, Indian people have been present differently, always con- testing a colonization that aimed not (only) to extract resources but to plunder Indian lands; to colonize, settle, and then forget and move on. And so Indigenous politics is not about claiming civil rights through the mechanism of the American state. Rather, it is about preserving and operationalizing tribal distinctiveness and autonomy, as con- stituted through American law in the form of the Constitution and the treaties, and holding the nation to its obligations, em- bodied in the form of trust relationships. American Indian people make up a small percentage of the population of the United This content downloaded from \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000207.194.177.233 on Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:47:51 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 147 (2) Spring 2018 15 Deloria, Lomawaima, Brayboy, Trahant, Ghiglione, Medin & Blackhawk States, and it is easy to ignore them. This, our contributors suggest, is a tremendous mis- take. Because of the distinct history of In- dian people and their persistent survival– they are not going anywhere!–Indian peo- ples are central to the ways in which we need to think about the collective future. Indians may often appear marginal in re- lation to courts, Congress, and academ- ic legal education, for example, but their unique legal and political status is critical to understanding wider issues of law and policy. Centering Indians in discussions of constitutionality, education and training, and actual jurisprudence will lead to under- standing issues in new ways. Centering In- dians in considerations of land claims and stewardship will cause non-Native anxiety levels to rise–in productive ways. And so with conversations about race, bioethics, environment, education, health care, gov- ernance, and more. The point is not so much that Indigenous perspectives need to be included in the gen- eral politics of knowledge (though that is true); rather it is that the Indigenous itself is generative of that knowledge, not peripher- al to it. Indigenous studies is not just about Indigenous people. It’s also about ways of seeing and investigating the world that have proven central. The challenge for non- Native people lies in escaping the bad habit of viewing Indigenous people as relics of the past. And yet, it’s not enough–as has been demonstrated any number of times–for Indigenous people to be content with the shout “We are still here!” Even that impor- tant statement about survival and the pres- ent connotes bedraggled refugees from the past, dragging the archaic along with them into an ill-fitting present. Better to think about the ways that Indian people can con- tribute to a still-forming future. We can imagine a future when the United States and its citizens commit to grappling with fundamental questions: What does it mean to live on Indian land? What does it mean that Indian people are still here? Moral, legal, ethical, and social issues and debates tumble out of those questions. But we can also imagine a nation and a cit- izenry strong enough to engage with these questions, strong enough to respect Native nations as inherent sovereigns, and strong enough to confront the mythologies and stereotypes that sustain a sense of national (and White) privilege and entitlement to ev- erything that has been built on Indian land. If we can imagine that, we can also imag- ine a nation and a citizenry strong enough to face up to its history: the intertwined sin of enslavement and the legacies of im- migration, exclusion, and racism. We can imagine a nation strong enough to grapple with the very definitions of citizenry: Who is included? Who is excluded? Why, and when, and how? We can imagine an inclu- sive nation bold enough to build a future on a complicated and painful past. In this task, one could do worse than to look to Ameri- can Indian nations and Native institutions for inspiration and ideas. author biographies philip j. deloria, a Fellow of the American Academy since 2015, is Professor of History at Harvard University.
