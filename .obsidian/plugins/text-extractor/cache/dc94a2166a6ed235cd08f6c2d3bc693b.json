Quasi-experiments Correlational studies No randomisation Outcome variables are measured Can deal with multiple discrete groups without inherent order Can deal with only two discrete groups without inherent order Regarding group-based data: 15 Quasi-experiment and CorrelationsHair length 1 2 16 Quasi-experiment and CorrelationsHair length 2 17 Internal validity is… 18How do I lack internal validity? Let me count the ways… Non-Violent Condition  Violent Condition  Midterms! 19 Threats to Internal Validity ▪ History : Any external event happening that affected participants (especially between first and second measurements) 20 Threats to Internal Validity 21 Threats to Internal Validity ▪ History : Any external event happening that affected participants (especially between first and second measurements) ▪ Maturation : People change over time (fatigue effect, get hungrier, more mature, etc.), independent of manipulation 22 Threats to Internal Validity Smoking cessation program offered Students who sign up Smoking frequency 4 packs/week Smoking cessation program Smoking frequency 1 pack/week 23 Threats to Internal Validity ▪ History : Any external event happening that affected participants (especially between first and second measurements) ▪ Maturation : People change over time, independent of conditions ▪ Testing : Taking a pretest is enough to change a participant’s posttest (e.g. practise effect) 24 Threats to Internal Validity 25 Threats to Internal Validity ▪ History : Any external event happening that affected participants (especially between first and second measurements) ▪ Maturation : People change over time, independent of conditions ▪ Testing : Taking a pretest is enough to change a participant’s behaviour ▪ Instrument decay : Characteristics of a measure, or people’s use of a measure, changes over time 26 Threats to Internal Validity ▪ Think about midterm scores ▫ Imagine you got 1% ■ What are the chances that, on your next midterm, you will get a score ≤ 1 vs. higher than 1? ▫ OR imagine you got 99% ■ What are the chances that, on your next midterm, you will get a score >= 99 vs. lower than 99? 27 Threats to Internal Validity ▪ History : Any external event happening that affected participants (especially between first and second measurements) ▪ Maturation : People change over time, independent of conditions ▪ Testing : Taking a pretest is enough to change a participant’s behaviour ▪ Instrument decay : Characteristics of a measure, or people’s use of a measure, changes over time ▪ Regression toward the mean : Participants, who are selected because of their extreme scores, tend to subsequently score closer to the mean","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
