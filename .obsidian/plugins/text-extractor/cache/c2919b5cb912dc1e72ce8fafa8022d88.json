Set Literature Review Problem Set Question 2 Here, the key is to notice the implication that P(A) = 1 has for P(¬A) and then to see what that means for P(A|B) Using one of our versions of Bayes’ theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|¬A)P(¬A) Since, P(A) = 1, we know that P(¬A) = 0 This means that P(B|¬A)P(¬A) = 0 So, P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) P(B|A)P(A) + 0 = 1 Whatever B is, you will

What is bad is when it is not acknowledged for what it is This would be like if Le Verrier had presented himself having predicted the anomalies, and then took them as deﬁnitive proof for the existence of the 8th planet Rather, Le Verrier presented his hypothesis as needing more testing This is a subtle, but signiﬁcant diﬀerence Kerr: HARKing belongs to the context of discovery more than the context of justiﬁcation Why? Since the studies were not designed to test the HARKed hypothesis, the correlations noted could just be spurious Gary Neels COGS 303 Assignments Replication and why it matters Sources of the Problem Systemic problems Questionable Research Practices So, maybe HARKing isn’t bad in itself...
