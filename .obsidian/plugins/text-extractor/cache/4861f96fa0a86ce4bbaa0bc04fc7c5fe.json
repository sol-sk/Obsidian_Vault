You may be asked about any of the topics listed above in the exam. The quizzes always focus on materials from the previous 2-3 weeks, and the materials you need to revise for each quiz are clearly indicated below. Quiz 1: Turing machines: • cognition as computation • understand the key components of a Turing machine • predict what a Turing machine will do given a description of the machine (rules, states, tape, current position of tape) • explain what a simple Turing machine does (e.g. \"this Turing machine counts in reverse binary\") • understand what a Universal Turing Machine is and what it is capable of (but there won't be any questions about how a UTM actually works) • understand what the Turing Test is Physical Symbol Systems: • syntax vs. semantics • symbols, expressions, processes, designation, interpretation • the Physical Symbol System Hypothesis • the Chinese room argument Language as a PSS • understand & reason about how different aspects of simple generative grammars correspond to elements of PSSs • Chomsky's argument about how simple automata (word-chain devices) are not sufficient to handle language • understand phrase structure rules (e.g. S -> NP VP) on a basic level • understand the key insight behind principles & parameters and X-bar theory on a basic level (cf. Pinker chapter) Language is not an instinct • what is modularity? • possible arguments for / against • what is innateness? • possible arguments for / against Quiz 2: Self-organisation • positive / negative feedback loops – what are they, recognise them when you see them • open non-equilibrium systems – what's open? what's non-equilibrium? • phase transitions: stability vs instability, control parameter / order parameter, adaptive landscape (showing attractor / stable states vs. unstable states) – understand these concepts and be able to apply them to specific examples • how is termite nest building an example of self-organisation? • how did we explain the synchronous flashing of fireflies in class? • how is this an example of self-organisation? Perceptron • how does a neuron work? including basic terminology (e.g. axons, dendrites, post-synaptic potential – see slides & Gurney (1997)) • perceptrons & perceptron networks – predict the behaviour of a network given specific inputs; be able to say what it does; for simple problems, be able to come up with specific weights / threshold values • the perceptron learning rule (understand intuition, no need to know formula) • linear separability Connectionism • distributed representations • graceful degradation • generalisation • gradient descent (understand the concept and what it means for the training of parameters in a connectionist network) Quiz 3: Deep Learning • interpreting the pattern of connections in a neural network (cf. https://adamharley.com/nn_vis/) • some different network / layer types: • fully connected feed forward • recurrent (only as much as is discussed in the reading); • convolutional (cf. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmpDIaiMIeA) LLMs • language modelling • traditional n-gram models • recurrent neural network • transformer architectures / attention mechanism • how are LLM’s trained? • unsupervised pre-training • supervised fine tuning, reinforcement learning with human feedback • the notion of scaling (number of parameters, size of training data) • formal vs. functional language competence Embodied Cognition • how does embodied cognition differ from traditional cognitive science? • what is the replacement hypothesis? • the four stages of embodied explanations according to Wilson & Golonka (2013) • the outfielder problem + its embodied explanation • the A-not-B problem + its embodied explanation Situated Cognition • embodied cognition vs. embedded cognition vs. extended cognition • online vs. offline embodiment • constitutive vs. causal embodiment • the Otto vs. Inga example (extended cognition) Quiz 4: Evolution of cognition • evolution of human cognition • the Swiss army-knife view • the New Thinking • techno-social coevolution • gene-culture coevolution • cumulative cultural adaptation Cognitive technology • what are possible responses to the observation that connectionist networks (and related approaches) often can't handle \"higher cognition\"? • how can cognitive technologies contribute to this issue? • how do language and labelling simplify higher-level / more abstract tasks? Cultural evolution • individual learning vs. social learning • how does the combination of individual + social learning enable the accumulation of knowledge? • social learning as an evolutionary response to environmental variability • relationship between the proportion of individual / social learners vs. fitness (assuming that the two kinds of learning are independent) • under what circumstances does social learning increase average population- level fitness? • true imitation • content vs. context biases • prestige & success biases Not included in quizzes (but could be included in exam): Iterated learning • what is iterated learning? • why does transmission error (typically) decrease in the course of iterated learning? • systematic underspecification • compositionality","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
