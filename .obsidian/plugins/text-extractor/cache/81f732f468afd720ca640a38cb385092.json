Dr. Dana Carney’s statement Methodological comments … 3. The sample size is tiny. 4. The data are ﬂimsy. The effects are small and barely there in many cases. 5. Initially, the primary DV of interest was risk-taking. We ran subjects in chunks and checked the effect along the way. It was something like 25 subjects run, then 10, then 7, then 5. Back then this did not seem like p-hacking. […] … 8. For the risk-taking DV: One p-value for a Pearson chi square was .052 and for the Likelihood ratio it was .05. The smaller of the two was reported […] … 10. The self-report DV was p-hacked in that many different power questions were asked and those chosen were the ones that “worked.” Potential confounds 1. The experimenters were both aware of the hypothesis. […] 2. When the risk-taking task was administered, participants were told immediately after whether they had “won.” […] Research shows that winning increases testosterone (e.g., Booth, Shelley, Mazur, Tharp, & Kittok, 1989). Thus, effects observed on testosterone as a function of expansive posture may have been due to the fact that more expansive postured- subjects took the “risk” and you can only “win” if you take the risk.
