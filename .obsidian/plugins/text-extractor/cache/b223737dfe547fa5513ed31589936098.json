Variability of X’s around !𝑋 • How much do observations differ from the sample mean or a regression line? • Confidence intervals describe the variability of the statistical model itself – Ex. Variability of !𝑋’s around µ !\" • How different might the sample mean or regression line be if I collected a new sample? 45 95% Confidence Interval Standard Error of the Estimate Confidence Intervals • Like α, we choose our conﬁdence! – Larger CI’s more certainly contain popula@on parameters • But are less prac9cally useful; & diﬃcult to falsify • Imagine a 100% Conﬁdence Interval… 6 Formula for Confidence Intervals 7 µ\t$%&'( = \t !𝑋%)* − (𝑠 !\"∗ 𝑡.,-.) µ\t/00'( = \t !𝑋%)* + (𝑠 !\"∗ 𝑡.,-.) – We start by assuming !𝑋%)* = µ • We assume that our observed data IS exactly the population parameter! NHST: Assuming H0 a priori expectation is true, here are plausible a posteriori observations (given sampling variability) CI: Assuming a posteriori observation is true, here are plausible population parameters (given sampling variability) 8 Formula for Conﬁdence Intervals 9 µ\t$%&'( = \t !𝑋%)* − (𝑠 !\"∗ 𝑡.,-.) µ\t/00'( = \t !𝑋%)* + (𝑠 !\"∗ 𝑡.,-.) – We start by assuming !𝑋%)* = µ – We add or subtract from the best guess ( !𝑋!\"#) to set upper and lower bounds for plausible population parameters – Standard error describes the variability of !𝑋!𝑠 given N • 𝑠 !\" = CI68% – Multiply by value of t that sets this area into each tail of the distribution of sample means • Normally this will be t.050 (when CI90%), t.025 (CI95%), t.005 (CI99%) Formula for Confidence Intervals What about when t = 1? – When t = 1…then !𝑋%)* is 1 𝑠 !\" away from µ • What is the area under the curve (AUC)? – When t = 1; then CI68%* *If N is large 10 µ\t$%&'( = \t !𝑋%)* − (𝑠 !\"∗ 𝑡?) µ\t/00'( = \t !𝑋%)* + (𝑠 !\"∗ 𝑡?) Formula for Conﬁdence Intervals t.005 is appropriate for a 99% CI – 0.5% of the time, actual parameter will be lower than the interval – 0.5% of the time, actual parameter will be higher than the interval 11 µ\t$%&'( = \t !𝑋%)* − (𝑠 !\"∗ 𝑡.,,.) µ\t/00'( = \t !𝑋%)* + (𝑠 !\"∗ 𝑡.,,.)

Subtract .90 from 1 1 - X = .10 2. Divide .10 by 2 \"#$ % = .05 3. Place result in lower/upper tail 4.
