Describe three basic experimental designs for studying the relationship between brain and behaviour. What advantages do each design confer? What limitations are associated with each? 3. Describe three methods for recording the brain’s electrical activity, including their benefits and drawbacks. 4. What is the “Halle Berry neuron”? What commonly held idea does it refute? What does it suggest about brain and behaviour? 5. What are the benefits of using animal models? How is cognition operationalized in animal models? Compare some methods that can be used to probe brain and behaviour. 6. Describe and compare the different methods of structural brain imaging that are listed in this lecture. 7. Explain how an MRI machine works. 8. Describe and compare the different methods of functional brain imaging that are listed in this lecture. 9. Explain how PET and fMRI work. 10. Discuss the various theoretical issues involved in interpreting functional brain imaging data. 11. Why might “a multi-methodological approach” often be the best answer to how to approach a research question in behavioural neuroscience? 3 How do we infer the relationship between brain and behaviour? In other words, how do we design an experiment in behavioural neuroscience? Most common approaches: • Induce a loss of function • Induce a gain of function • Monitor behaviour and brain activity simultaneously Each has considerations and limitations Again, sometimes a true experiment isn’t feasible Methods 4 No one ideal method • Scales • Trade-offs Methods 5 The following is a non-exhaustive list of methods! Recording the brain’s electrical activity • Single-cell recording • Electroencephalography (EEG) • Event-related potentials (ERP) Electrical activity 6 Single-cell recording • Intracellular • Extracellular Electrical activity 7 Single-cell recording: what does it mean? • i.e. Firing patterns – Raster plots • Population coding Electrical activity Ma et al. 2016, JNeuro 8 Convergence and divergence • Parallel processing • Distributed representations • Population coding • But… Electrical activity 9 The Halle Berry neuron? • See also: Batman, Sidney Opera House (or similar?), Jennifer Aniston • Some high convergence in the brain • Probably still involved in other population coding (let’s hope so!) Electrical activityQuiroga et al., 2005 10 Two main limitations to directly recording electrical activity 1. Getting more electrodes into the brain 2. Making sense of tremendous amounts of data Electrical activity Jun et al., 2017 11 Zhao et al., 2022 EEG Electrical activity • Measuring from the scalp (Iimitations?) • Waves have both a frequency and amplitude • Frequency measured in Hz (cycles/second) 12 EEG waves: brain states? • Gamma waves Electrical activity Alpha – 8-12Hz Beta – 12-30Hz Gamma – 26-100Hz Delta – 0-3Hz Theta – 4-7Hz 1314 EEG: Sleep has multiple phases Measured with EEG (and EMG, EOG) Types of sleep categorized by EEG wave types! (Frequency and amplitude) NREM 1 NREM 2 NREM 3-4 REM *NREM also known as slow-wave sleep (SWS) Electrical activity 15 But what do these waves mean? EEG likely represents PSPs more than APs Waves show population synchrony Gamma: we’ve discussed before Alpha/beta: conscious brain activity? Theta ripples: driven by medial temporal lobe? Delta: was unclear, but new ideas related to sleep 15Electrical activity EEG: gamma waves • “Information processing”, attention, maybe consciousness • Meditation: highest amplitude gamma recorded (Lutz et al. 2004) – Gamma changes with skill level! • Rhythm possibly mediated by fast-spiking, GABAergic interneurons (Cardin et al. 2009) Electrical activity 16 ERPs • Averaged response to a stimulus • Subcomponents Electrical activity 17 Transcranial magnetic stimulation • Usually to make “virtual lesions” • Potential therapeutic applications • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMR_T0mM7Pc Electrical activity 18 Deep thoughts by the rat Some examples: • Morris water maze • 5-choice serial reaction time task • Conditioning (classical, operant) • T-maze Animal models 19 BUT the quality of your model is determined by the quality of your behavioural assay A notable offender: the forced-swim test (FST) FST used to measure depression in the rodent, as well as antidepressant medication efficacy Difficulties in interpretation? Animal models 20 Why use animal models? Because they truly model Mammalian brain similarity Animal cognition is sophisticated Animal models 21 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRRISM23ABk Drug “Challenge” • Potential Routes – Intramuscular (IM) – Intravenous (IV) – Subcutaneous (SC) – Intraperitoneal (IP) • Perhaps most common – Intraventricular • Overcomes problems with drugs passing the blood-brain barrier – Multiple doses is best (e.g. saline only, then low, med, high) • Within-subjects design Animal models 22 Invasive Electrical Recording Methods • Four Invasive Electrophysiological Recording Methods – Intracellular Unit Recording – Extracellular Unit Recording – Multiple-Unit Recording – Invasive EEG Recording https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DJOTEDBA2c Animal models 23 Stereotaxic surgery • For lesions, optogenetics, electrodes, more • Employs stereotaxic atlas and instrument • Allows accurate placement of lesions, probes, electrodes, etc. • Reference point used is bregma Animal models 24 Lesion methods • Chemical, i.e. excitotoxic lesions – e.g. quinolinic acid, ibotenic acid • Selective chemical lesions – e.g. 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), 5,7-dihydroxytriptamine (5,7-DHT) • Reversible lesions, aka inactivations – Cannulae – e.g. baclofen + muscimol – Benefit: within-subjects design! • Interpretation of lesion studies • Ideal post-surgery testing window? • Unilateral vs. bilateral vs. contralateral lesions Animal models 25 Optogenetics • Introducing: light-gated ion channels! – Channelrhodopsins • Use system-specific transcription factors • Can be used for both recording/mapping and manipulation Animal models 26 Reminder: stains are cool • Golgi stain • Nissl stain / cresyl violet stain • Fibre stains – Luxol-fast blue (LFB) – Toluidine blue • Green fluorescent protein (GFP) – Many derivatives (e.g. YFP, BFP) – Can be inserted into living cells! • e.g. Single-neuron electroporation • And much more! Imaging 27 LFB stain Courtesy Dr. Kurt Haas Tectum neuron with GFP in awake animal! Neuroimaging: structural and functional • Static: AKA structural – Computerized axial tomography (CAT / CT) – Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) • Dynamic: AKA functional – Positron emission tomography (PET) – Functional MRI (fMRI) – Resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rsfcMRI) Imaging 28 X-Ray X-ray tube, X-ray beam, film (or detectors) What can be seen? Structural imaging 29 Computed tomography (CT) The tube and detector Structural imaging 30 Computed tomography (CT) Only as good as its algorithms Useful for? Drawbacks? 1977 1983 2004 Rorden & Karnath, 2004 Structural imaging 31 Computed Tomography (CT) • Previously useful for stroke – Why? Structural imaging 32 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Structural imaging https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBx8BwLhqg 33 MRI Structural imaging 34 MRI Structural imaging 35 Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) • Variant of MRI • Relies on how water molecules move in brain • Useful for? Structural imaging 36 PET using radiolabelled cocaine (from Shumay et al., 2011) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Functional imaging 37 PET • Indirect measure (as is fMRI) – Meaning? Potential issues? Functional imaging 38 PET • Subtraction method (similar for some fMRI) – Potential issues? Functional imaging 39 PET: less common now, but… • Very expensive • Temporally slow • Poor spatial resolution BUT • Useful for targeting specific systems (e.g. DA) Functional imaging 40 PET: dopamine D2 receptors decreased by addiction Functional imaging 41 Functional MRI (fMRI): the BOLD response Functional imaging 42 Hemodynamic response fMRI Imaging 4344 fMRI: BOLD response Functional imaging Paired Image Subtraction Functional imaging 45 The quality of your results depends on the quality of your controls! Paired Image Subtraction Functional imaging 4647 Common in fMRI these days Allows you to avoid paired image subtraction Has many of its own challenges (e.g. boredom!) Event-related fMRI Functional imaging Huettel 2012, adapted from Blamire et al. 1992 Hosking et al. 2017 Problems with interpreting fMRI studies? 1. Spatial averaging 2. Spatial resolution 3. Temporal resolution 4. Not necessarily necessity 5. Focus on increases in activity Thinking critically 48 Voxel = 3D pixel Resting state functional connectivity MRI The default mode network 5. Focus on increases in activity: some regions are more active at rest than during task! Thinking critically 49 mPFC, posterior parietal cortex, PCC, hipp, lateral temporal cortex6. Regional hemodynamics 7. Confounds: anxiety, boredom 8. Drugs 9. Anticipatory hemodynamics 10. Reliability 11. Statistics Problems with interpreting fMRI studies? Thinking critically 50 11. Statistics Thinking critically 51 The heavy metal brain? Thinking critically • Poor assumptions? • Multiple methods is critical 52 Which biopsychology method would you choose to study the following questions, and why? 1. Loss of grey matter in the weeks following a stroke 2. Changes in non-cortical brain activity following a stroke 3. Cortical activity while running on a treadmill 4. The external stimuli and situations in which a neuron fires 5. Changes in protein expression following a neurodegenerative disease (e.g. Alzheimer’s, CTE) 6. The role of the hippocampus in spatial learning and navigation. 7. Changes in decision making and motivation following acute and chronic drug use. 8. How we select words from our vocabulary for speaking. 9. The role of monoamine neurotransmitters in motivation. 10. What regions of the motor cortex control what parts of the body.
