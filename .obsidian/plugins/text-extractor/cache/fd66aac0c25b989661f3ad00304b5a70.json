Primates innately scared of snakes, but lesions of the amygdala abolish this fear•With many other harmful things in our environment, we learn to be afraid of them–Amygdalaplays an essential role in learning to be afraid of potentially harmful things 3Pavlovian (Classical) Conditioning (I)•Virtually all animals display Pavlovian conditioning–Helps organism prepare for biologically significant events in response to cues that predict those events•Four main elements–Unconditioned Stimulus (US)= the biologically significant event (meat powder in Pavlov’s dog’s mouth)–Unconditioned Response (UR) = normal response to significant event (salivation) –Conditioned Stimulus(CS) = Previously neutral cue that reliably predicts significant event (bell predicts meat powder)–Conditioned Response(CR) = The body’s response to the CS alone (salivating to the bell)4Pavlovian (Classical) Conditioning (II)Five key points:1)CS must reliably predict the US2)Delivery of CS & US are uncontrollable by the organism3)The CR is also uncontrollable–Typically an autonomic response (e.g.: heart rate) but can also be motor (Pavlovian approach)4)In humans, the CR typically occurs in absence of conscious knowledge5)Very long lasting: –Can be extinguished, but reinstated very quickly with another CS-US pairing•Lesions to amygdala subnucleiabolish freezing and autonomic response to the tone (CS)•Lesions made priorto conditioning (acquisition) or afterconditioning (expression)both disrupt conditioned response (so you need the amygdala to both learnand recallfear)•These lesions do not affectresponse to shock•Similar results in humanswith Amygdala damage=disrupted fear conditioning (blood pressure, heart rate)5The Amygdala and Fear Conditioning(I)CS=toneUS=shockCR=freezeB.P.Auditory Fear Conditioning:-Freezing natural defensive response for rodents-In the lab, tones easier to deal with than visual cues6The Amygdala and Fear Conditioning(II)•Neurons in lateral amygdala show changes in firing to CS tone over the course of learning that parallels emergence of conditioned response–Human Imaging studies = increase activation in amygdala to CS after conditioningCentral amygdalaLateral amygdalaLateral sends signals to centralAuditory info (CS)Both inputs converge in lateral amygdalaPain info (US)Central sends signals to areas which initiate autonomic, emotional and freezing responses Firing to tone before learningFiring to tone and shockFiring to CS tone after learningSensory input (Thalamic, Cortical)7Amygdala and Appetitive Conditioning(I)•The amygdala also regulates Pavlovianconditioning for rewarding stimuli–Conditioned response typically approach behaviour (e.g: conditioned place preference)–The “place” where reward was received becomes attractive elicits approach towards those stimuli (Pavlovian approach)•Lesions of the lateral amygdaladisrupts conditioned place preference for all types of rewards (food, sex, drugs)—Note: amygdalalesions do notdisrupt consumptionof reward (food, sex, etc)–Only interferes with how conditioned stimuli linked with primary reward affect behaviourSomething GOODhappens here (e.g, food, sex, drugs)NOTHING happens hereOn test, animal spends more time in the “GOOD’ chamber8Reward-associated cues can control our behaviour, sometimes without us being aware-Subjects conducted a “memory task” (find the red ball, not the black ball)-Finding the REDball = pleasant tone, with distinct patterned background and a food reward -Black Ball = Buzzer, no reward, other pattern-PREFERENCE TEST: Subjects shown different patterns, including ones linked to “Red ball-reward” responses: asked to choose which pattern they prefer-Results: healthy humans preferred pattern associated with reward-Left or Right amygdala lesions (LA / RA):NO PREFERENCE-When controls asked “why do you prefer this one?”:no conscious associationwith pattern & rewarde.g.:\"looks like the sun\", \"reminds me of pizza\", \" is a little more complicated\", \"is symmetrical\", \"I liked the lines and curves\", \"was an interesting sort of pattern, caught my eye.\"Red ball, medodictone +Black ball, buzzer, NO rewardPreference TestAmygdala and Appetitive Conditioning(II)normalRewardedNon rewarded9Instrumental Conditioning (I)•Pavlovian Conditioning: association of a neutral stimulus with a biologically-significant event (no control over what happens, organism can only react/prepare)–Reinforcer: something that increases or decreases likelihood of response occurring again–e.g.; Rat presses lever to obtain food, learning to ride a bike (skill learning). •Instrumental Conditioning: (aka operant conditioning) association with a particular action/motor response and its consequences (i.e.: reinforcement) Here the organism can control what happens10Instrumental Conditioning (II)•Regions of thestriatum (part of a larger subcortical system called the basal ganglia) regulates action selection and instrumental conditioningStriatum receives converging inputs from sensory/motor cortex and dopamine system–both are activated when actions are reinforced to facilitate learning DopamineglutamateInstrumental learning goes through phases–Early in learning = goal-directed, responses are made to obtain a goal, sensitive to levels of motivation–Late in learning = responses become more automatic (habitual) mediated by dorsal striatum–The transition from goal-directed to habitual actions is also mediated by the dorsal striatum •The amygdalasends input to the striatum and can influence instrumental action11Amygdala and Appetitive Conditioning(III)•Rats press lever just for CS, even though that nevergives reward–Light becomes reinforcing, animals will work for it•Lesions to lateral amygdala disrupts preference for lever that produces the CS (no conditionedreinforcement)–Yet, they consume reward normally, press levers for foodnormally, •Cues associated with reward can control our behaviour, even though we may be unaware of their controlConditioned Reinforcement:-CS light comes on that predicts reward presentation (e.g.; food)-After learning, levers are inserted to chamber-One lever gives CS light that was associated with food, other gives nothing (lever presses never deliver reward)This light is GREAT!Amygdala Lesion020406080Control Lever pressesCS leverOther lever","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
