Why is authority considered the weakest form of knowledge? When is authority useful? 2. Why should you not rely solely on your intuition? Describe some errors using this form of knowledge. 3. Describe what science is, and the scientific method. 4. What features does good science require? 5. What features does pseudoscience typically have? 6. What are the goals of psychological research? 7. Be sure you can describe all types of variables in this lecture. 8. Define non-experimental and experimental studies. Why would you ever want to perform a non-experiment? 9. Understand the very basics of statistics in psychology. 10. What is P hacking? Why is it a problem? 11. Describe construct validity, how construct validity is attained, and internal/external validity. 12. What’s the difference between accuracy and reliability? Be sure you could explain an example that would help anyone understand this difference. 13. Describe why we can’t say that “IQ is 50% genetic.” Learning objectives Why study research methods? • For your health • For your wallet • For your career • For your edification • For your community • To properly understand and interpret psychology and neuroscience studies Intro4 The central problem: How do we acquire correct information about the world? i.e. “truth”, “facts”, “knowledge” We can • Ask someone else • Trust our “guts” • Observe • Test 5 Intro 1. Authority • Whose authority? • Weakest form • Sometimes useful • When is it useful? • Often exploited • Often overextended New York Times, August 10th, 1993 Authority6 Problems with authority: bullshit “One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit.” —Frankfurt, 1986 (!) Differs from lies! Authority7 2. Intuition • Commonly a starting point in science • Draws from life (anecdotal) experience • Sometimes correct • Often wrong Intuition8 Problems with intuition: illusory correlation Intuition9 Problems with intuition: correlation ≠ causation Intuition10 Problems with intuition: correlation ≠ causation Intuition Smoking Ashtrays Lung cancer The third variable problem 11 Problems with intuition: susceptible to bias Intuition12 Problems with intuition: overconfidence • The Dunning-Kruger effect Intuition13 Problems with intuition: we struggle with probability • What’s the probability of rolling a 6? Intuition14 or • I just rolled three 6s in a row? What’s the probability of rolling another 6? • I’m about to roll five dice. Which is more likely? Gambler’s fallacy Even more problems with intuition • Confirmation bias • Hindsight bias, aka creeping determinism • Post-hoc explanations: not necessarily correct Intuition15 Intuition Researchers have found that people with high self-confidence are more susceptible to flattery than those with low self-confidence. Does this make sense? Why? 16 Intuition Researchers have found that people with low self-confidence are more susceptible to flattery than those with high self-confidence. Does this make sense? Why? 17 Intuition (Which one is it?) (But…) 18 3. Observation • Critical to good science: empiricism • Works best with objective measures • Still not enough to acquire the best information about the world… Observation19 Problems with observation: bias/limited explanatory power Observation20 Scientific skepticism • Question authority and intuition • Question your senses • Question knowledge, beliefs • Systematic doubt and continual testing • BUT be careful of extreme skepticism / extreme postmodernity: these are the tools of obfuscation The scientific method21 The scientific method • Observation • Idea • Consult past research • Hypothesis • Design study • Ethical approval • Collect data • Analyze data • Modify and repeat (if hypothesis wrong), or • Consider implications of results, build theories The scientific method22 The Scientific Method (part 2) The scientific method23 Good science • Materialism • Universalism • Communality • Disinterestedness • Organized skepticism The scientific method24 Developing a theory • “Theory” • Common use ≠ scientific use • Organize and explain a variety of facts/descriptions/observations • Falsifiable • Generate new knowledge • Parsimonious The scientific method25 Pseudoscience • Often relies on authority • Emphasis on scientific-sounding jargon • Not falsifiable • Poor/no methodology • Poor/no/anecdotal evidence • Not peer reviewed • Ignores/conflicts with known/ existing evidence • Vague claims • Often reinforces status quo or a worldview • Does not facilitate further research The scientific method26 Goals of psychological research The scientific method • Describe behaviour • Predict behaviour • Determine causes of behaviour • Influence/control behaviour (?) • Example 1: Facebook (Kramer et al. 2014) • Example 2: Marshmallow task (video) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLtQaRrDsC4 27 Types of research Research design • Basic research • Applied research 28 Variable Conceptual Variable Measured Variable Operational Variable Research design Research design basics 29 Situational Variables Dependent Variable Participant Variables Independent Variable Research design Four general categories of variables 30 Random assignment Relationships Between Variables Non-experimental Method: Correlation Research Research design31 Relationships Between Variables pos i ti v e ne ga ti v e curvilinear none Research design32 Relationships Between Variables Research design33 Relationships Between Variables Research design34 Correlation: r From -1 (perfect negative correlation) To 1 (perfect positive correlation) Relationships Between Variables Issue with correlation: the third-variable problem Research design35 Relationships Between Variables Experimental Method Independent Variable Dependent Variable Research design36 Causality • Covariation of cause and effect • Temporal precedence • No more plausible alternative explanation Research design37 Relationships Between Variables Experimental Method Confounding Variable Research design e.g. 1: drug injection e.g. 2: brain region inactivation e.g. 3: drug self-administration 3839 Example: Clinical Drug Studies • Placebo as control – Exception: if treatment already exists • Treatment arms • Blinded procedures – Single blind – Double blind – Open label Research design40 Animal Models for Research • Animals are used for research: – Understand basic mechanisms, genetics, etc. – Because there are no viable alternatives – Because they have high predictive value – Have a number of protections in place (e.g. CCAC, ACC) Research design41 Human Research • Ethical considerations must be made – Federally mandated committees review human research proposals – Informed consent Research design42 Your turn! Design an experiment to test which drink people like better, Coca Cola or Pepsi. What are your independent variables? What are your dependent variables? What are your other variables? What are some potential confounding variables, and how will you avoid them? In-class “assignment” Correlations revisited Generally people use r2, not r Gives shared variance in sample if r = 0.3, then r2 = 0.09, or 9% Statistics43 Mean, median, mode Important for understanding and splitting up your data These are histograms Statistics44 The standard regression equation i.e. The line of best fit y = mx + b If you have this equation, and you have x, you can predict y Statistics45 Standard deviation and standard error Standard deviation: tells you how wide the normal curve is, i.e. how much variance there is in your data Standard error: how far the sample mean is from the population mean Statistics46 Statistical significance i.e. p Comparing test measurement to control measurement, while taking the sample size into account Typically, significance level is p < 0.05 ß meaning? Gives likelihood of correct measurement, not effect size Statistics47 Effect size e.g. Cohen’s d Note: r is also a measure of effect size! Tells us magnitude of effect of IV on DV Very important, often overlooked Statistics48 Need for higher significance level? Sometimes! Consider: fMRI ~60,000-1,000,000 voxels for brain scan Every voxel requires a statistical test If p = 0.05, how many false positives? Must correct for multiple comparisons Statistics49 P hacking Sometimes accidental, sometimes not Statistics50 Construct validity • CRITICAL! Validity51 Indicators of construct validity: • Face validity Validity52 Indicators of construct validity: • Content validity Validity53 Indicators of construct validity: • Concurrent and convergent validity Validity54 Indicators of construct validity: • Discriminant validityDependent variable Unrelated construct/operational definition Validity55 Indicators of construct validity: • Predictive validity Validity56 Types of validity: • Internal validity Validity57 Types of validity: • External validity Validity58 Again, we need to consider if our participants are WEIRD! (Henrich et al. 2010) Measures need to be both accurate (valid) and reliable • Accuracy (validity) • Reliability Validity59 Accurate and reliable Neither accurate nor reliable Reliable but not accurate Issues in biopsychology • Continuity and stages – Continuous vs. discrete • Stability and change – Stable vs. labile • Nature and nurture – Not vs., but rather their interactions Issues in biopsychology 60 Nature and Nurture • What’s more important? à • Poorly understood • e.g. heritability estimate – “the heritability estimate for IQ is 0.5” – Describes variance, not correlation Issues in biopsychology 61 Nature and Nurture • Are arms 0% genetic? Issues in biopsychology § OK, back to IQ… 62 Nature and Nurture • Turkheimer et al. 2003 Issues in biopsychology 63 Nature and Nurture • PLEASE MAKE IT STOP Issues in biopsychology 6465 Science is not… • A dogma (it’s simply a method) • Scientists (it’s simply a method) • Pharmaceutical companies (it’s simply a method) • Doctors (it’s simply a method) The scientific method66 Science is… As good as it currently gets • Science’s history is full of questionable characters, but the scientific method remains our best way of acquiring information about the world • Scientific models of the world may be incomplete, but they’re certainly more accurate than any others • Ignoring the best available evidence leads to tangible harm and misfortune • Whether or not you believe in science, large institutions do and are using it The scientific method","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
