(1957-) Warm-up: What have we learned so far about the Zapatistas? • “Twelve Women in the Twelfth Year” • “War! First Declaration from the Lacandon Jungle” • “Tomorrow Begins Today” • “Why We use the Weapon of Resistance” • “The Sea of my Insomnia” • “Tlatelolco” How does the Zapatista cause and context differ from the Cuban one? How is the leadership/governance structure? Is there a “Zapatista ideology”? Who and what are they fighting against? How do they fight? How do they view and incorporate history into their approach to change? Is their war “just”? Why or why not? What is the appeal for others (within or from outside of Mexico) to join and/or support their cause? Recap: What have we seen so far? Why is our war just? How does this movement respond to that? What do we do to fulfill our goals and to spread our message? 3/17/24 CC Brianne Orr-Álvarez The Zapatistas’ Performance-based Political Approach Summarizing Zapatista Politics… The Sierra Maestra (Cuba) The Lacandon Jungle (Mexico) North Zone Council of the Good Government. Trafficking of weapons, planting Of drugs, drug and alcohol use, And illegal sales of wood are Strictly prohibited. No to the Destruction of nature. You are in Zapatista rebel Territory. Here the people rule And the government obeys. Autonomous Territory A “third” way/approach to politics Zapatista politics Does the EZLN follow a clear political program or plan? Who is the enemy they fight against? The EZLN and the Politics of Inclusion “She. Has no military rank, no uniform, no weapon. Only she knows she is a Zapatista. Much like the Zapatistas, she has no face or name. She struggles for democracy, liberty, and justice, just like the Zapatistas. She is part of what the EZLN calls “civil society”— a people without a political party, who do not belong to “political society,” made up of leaders of political parties. Rather, she is a part of that amorphous yet solid part of society that says, day after day, “Enough is enough!” (26). The political subject of the EZLN is everyone and no one at the same time… Now let’s turn toward Nicaragua… A Revolutionary Timeline 1910 Mexican Revolution El Porfiriato 1917 Constitution 1940s- Land Reform? Rural Flight 1953 -Democracy in Guatemala -July 26th Movement 1953-1959 The Cuban Revolution 1961 -Cuba goes Communist -Bay of Pigs Invasion -Castro’s words to Intellectuals PRI The Cold War 1967 Che’s death The Battle of Pancasán The start of the Sandinista Rebellion! What can you “infer” about Nicaragua from these images? • On the next slide, you will see several images (graffiti and others) that represent Nicaragua’s (political) past and present. • What can you infer from these images? Do they support or contrast the touristic promotion of the Central American country that was playing as you entered our Zoom room? Colonialism– Independence – Resources – National Disasters - Corruption DICTATORSHIP | EXPLOITATION then and now Sandino Carlos Fonseca | FSLN Daniel Ortega A FEW “SIGNIFICANT” MEN William Walker Why does he matter? Who was he? -A North American filibuster (independent military operator) What did he do? -He travelled to Nicaragua, hoping to establish English-speaking colonies in the late 19th century (1856); -He declared himself president of the country and ruled for one year; How did it all end? -He was then executed by a coalition of Central American Armies in 1960. Why is this important to us? -Walker’s attitude and actions toward Nicaragua are directly related to the creation of the Monroe Doctrine (1823), which some associate with the “Backyard policy.” (even though the Doctrine initially pushed an anti-interventionist approach). Augusto Sandino (1895-1934): Model of Anti-imperialist left Who was he? A peasant and rebel leader from Nicaragua who was against US occupation of Nicaragua; Why was he important? - He organized a guerrilla fight and an anti- imperialist campaign between the years of 1927-1933 from the mountains. - Even the US marines were incapable of beating him in combat… so… How did it all end? Then dictator Anastasio Somoza García and his National Guard assassinated him in 1934.

Won the Premio Casa de las Américas in 1982: Testimonial Genre What is a “testimony” or “testimonial narrative”? TESTIMONY (Narratives of urgency and resistance) Based on eye witness account Emphasis on history and truth The testimony “A novel or novella-length narrative in book or pamphlet told in the first person by a narrator who is also the real protagonist or witness of the [urgent] events he or she recounts, and whose unit of narration is usually a“life” or a significant life experience” (24-25). (The Real Thing: Testimonial Discourse and Latin America (1996, Ed. G. Gugelberger), In Che Guevara’s Reminiscences, we only see what Revolution looks like on the Sierra Maestra. León Frente Sandinista León First impressions • What image of the book does the title provoke? • The first chapter is titled “Holy Week”. What does this make you think of ? • Let’s take a look at the first paragraph of the book to see what we learn from Cabezas! “Holy Week” • “During Holy Week my hometown is a ghost town, with medieval trimmings. Holy Week in León is hot, the car seats are hot, the park benches are hot, even the water out of the tap is hot. Everything in that town is hot during Holy Week. The hair on your head is hot, your thoughts are hot – believe me, Holy Week in León is hot! Look, it’s so hot there are practically no cars out in the street. In the center of town there aren’t even people – they all go to the sea. I’m talking about the middle class, who live where the streets are paved, where the rich people live, in the center of town” (1). For Wednesday: read from Cabezas’s Fire from the Mountain these chapters: • “Holy Week”: Introduction to León, social classes, politics, revolution (and what he thinks of it!), and space (the sea vs. Lezama’s) • “Strength and Numbers”: The Guard vs. The Frente (and “being like Che”) • “Sandino and the Indians”: Students and their theories, Subtiava and how he earns their support (provides additional context; optional reading)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
