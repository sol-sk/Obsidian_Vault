Is it a stable measure? Are we measuring what we think we’re measuring? Can we infer causality? Can we generalize our findings beyond this group & setting? Reliability Construct Validity Internal Validity External Validity 3 Reliability Test-retest reliability Internal consistency reliability Inter-rater reliability 4 Reliability True Score Error of Measurement Person X’s Obtained Score True Score Error of Measurement Person X’s Obtained Score 5 Reliability n = 100 How funny does this guy look? 1 = Not funny at all 5 = very funny 6 Reliability True Score Error of Measurement Person X’s Obtained Score True Score Error of Measurement Person X’s Obtained Score 7 Reliability ▪ Test-retest reliability – How would we assess this? ▫ Evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient 89 Reliability 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 0 1 2 3 4 5 6Funniness (Time 2) Funniness (Time 1) 10 Reliability ▪ Inter-rater reliability ▫ Evaluated by Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), amongst others 11 Reliability ▪ Other uses of inter-rater reliability Behavioural coding Thematic/Content codingPersonality Measures 12 Reliability ▪ Internal consistency reliability ▫ Evaluated using inter-item correlations ▫ Evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha (α) (combining inter-item correlations) ■ Scores similar across different questions? ▫ Evaluated using Item-total correlation 1314 When constructing a measure Does it measure the construct with little error? Is it a stable measure? Are we measuring what we think we’re measuring? Can we infer causality? Can we generalize our findings beyond this group & setting? Reliability Construct Validity Internal Validity External Validity 15 Construct validity Construct Validity Does content of measure reflect the meaning of the construct? Face validity Content validity How does this measure relate to other measures and behaviours? Predictive validity Concurrent validity Convergent validity Discriminant validity 16 Risk-taking measure ▪ 4 different factors/components to risk-taking ▫ Factor 1: Thrill-seeking behaviours ▫ Factor 2: Rebellious behaviours ▫ Factor 3: Reckless behaviours ▫ Factor 4: Antisocial behaviours 17 Construct Validity  Look at each item.  Does it look like it’s assessing risk-taking?  Usually happens, but not a requirement of measures.  Look at the whole measure.  Is it capturing all the important parts of what it means to be a risk taker in adolescence?  And nothing more Face Validity Content Validity 18 Construct Validity Construct Validity Does content of measure reflect the meaning of the construct? Face validity Content validity How does this measure relate to other measures and behaviours? Predictive validity Concurrent validity Convergent validity Discriminant validity 19 Construct Validity Definition Question to Address: Do people with high scores on your measure… Predictive Validity Predicts future, conceptually related outcomes …at T1 go on to do relevant behaviors at T2? Concurrent Validity Related to relevant outcomes assessed at the same time …behave in ways you’d expect them to behave if they were high on this construct? 20 Construct Validity Definition Question to Address Do people with high scores on your measure… Convergent Validity Related to scores on other measures of the same/a theoretically similar construct …predict scores on theoretically related measures? Discriminant Validity Not related (ie: zero correlations) to what it shouldn’t relate to …randomly vary with constructs that are supposed to be unrelated to this construct?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
