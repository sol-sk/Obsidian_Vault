What are the symbols of this movement? Meanwhile… in Mexico… From FLN (National Liberation Forces) and EZLN (Zapatista Army of National Liberation) FLN (1969-1980) • armed guerrilla movement • closely follows Che’s “foco theory” • emerge in response to ‘68 • events • seek new government EZLN (1983-) • Merging of FLN with indigenous insurgents • Chiapas, Mexico • Focused on issues of land, human needs and rights, inclusive politics • Zapatismo: “to build a better world, that is, a new world.” (Marcos) January 1, 1994 • TLC / NAFTA Comes into effect • The EZLN declares war on the state of Mexico We are the product of 500 years of war… but today, we say enough (is enough)! among other things… Assassination of Cardinal Posadas (1993) and Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta (1994) (indirectly?… by then President Carlos Salinas de Gortari) Who and what do the Neo-Zapatistas Speak out against? NAFTA (1994-2018) Neoliberalism: the deregulation of the economy The PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party) and Carlos Salinas de Gortari (President 1988-1994) Colonialism What are the Movement’s tools and goals? http://timesofahmad.blogspo t.ca/2015/01/perspective- words-as-weapons-irfan.html Zack de la Rocha Manu Chao: Zapatistas Anthem Subcomandante Marcos Dignity, Authority, Arrogance? Marcos’s Writing Declarations and Speeches Letters Interviews Stories Subcommander Marcos “El Sup” The “not quite Commander…” Words as weapons…https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0-rPLK5JpA “The First Declaration from the Lacandon Jungle” (January 2, 1994) “TO THE PEOPLE OF MEXICO: MEXICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS: We are a product of 500 years of struggle: first against slavery, then during the War of Independence against Spain led by insurgents, then to avoid being absorbed by North American imperialism, then to promulgate our constitution and expel the French empire from our soil, and later the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz denied us the just application of the Reform laws and the people rebelled and leaders like Villa and Zapata emerged, poor men just like us. We have been denied the most elemental preparation so they can use us as cannon fodder and pillage the wealth of our country. They don't care that we have nothing, absolutely nothing, not even a roof over our heads, no land, no work, no health care, no food nor education. Nor are we able to freely and democratically elect our political representatives, nor is there independence from foreigners, nor is there peace nor justice for ourselves and our children. But today, we say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.” History of oppression The “we/us” and the “they/them” Who are “we”? “We are the inheritors of the true builders of our nation. We are millions, the dispossessed who call upon our brothers and sisters to join the struggle as the only path, so that we will not die of hunger due to the insatiable ambition of a seventy-year dictatorship led y a clique of traitors who represent the most conservative and sellout groups” (13). Who are “they”? The “Mexican federal army, the pillar of the Mexican dictatorship from which we suffer, monopolized by a one- party system (PRI) and led by Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the maximum and illegitimate federal executive that today holds power” (14). Declaration of War • “According to this Declaration of War, we ask that other powers of the nation advocate to restore the legitimacy and the stability of the nation by overthrowing the dictator.” • Does this sound familiar? What are the demands? • 1) democratic elections • 2) protection of prisoners • 3) condemnation of all “traitors to our country” • 4) new group in charge: the Zapatista Army of National Liberation; • 5) surrender of all to avoid unnecessary loss of lives; • 6) “Suspend the robbery of our natural resources…” Follow-up Communiqué • “Dying In Order to Live” (January 6, 1994) • Here we are, the dead of all times, dying once again, but now in order to live… • “During these past ten years more than 150,000 indigenous have died of curable diseases. The federal, state, and municipal governments and their economic and social programs do not take into account any real solution to our problems; they limit themselves to giving us charity every time elections roll around. Charity resolves nothing but for the moment, and again death visits our homes […] We are ready to die, 150,000 more if necessary, so that our people awaken from this dream of deceit that holds us hostage” (17). But who is Marcos… really? I will save that for the end of the week! For Wednesday 1. “12 Women in the 12th year” 20. Tomorrow Begins Today 30. “Why we use the Weapon of Resistance” See guiding questions on the next slide! 1. “Twelve women in the Twelfth Year” • 1) What is the hook of this essay? [How does Marcos draw us, the readers, in?] • 2) How is this essay structured? • 3) How does Marcos present himself and the 12 women of this essay to the reader? • 4) How would you describe the role of women, in particular indigenous women, in this movement? • 5) What narrative strategies and tropes do you observe in this essay? Do you see similarities with other types of narratives we’ve read this semester? 20. “Tomorrow Begins Today” • 1) How do you define neoliberalism? What is Marcos’s view of it? How does he define it? • 2) How does Marcos play with time, space, and perspective in this speech? • 3) How does he establish connections among the Zapatista fight and global issues? • 4) What is the significance of this statement? “Many fences had to be broken to come and break through the fence around reality. There are different fences. In ours, one must get past the police, customs officials, tanks, cannons, trenches, planes, helicopters, rain, mud, insects. Each one of the rebels from the five continents has his or her own fence, struggle, and a broken fence to add to the memory of other rebels.” • 5) Does Marcos seem to see this “encuentro” (encounter/gathering) as an isolated event? Why or why not? 30. “Why We Use Weapons of Resistance” • 1) What is the meaning of the title? • 2) What are some of the points/concepts that Marcos sets out to redefine in this essay? Why? • 3) Why do the Zapatistas say this: “I am as I am and you are as you are. Let’s build a world where I can be, and not have to cease being me, where you can be, and not have to cease being you, and where neither I nor you will force another to be like either me or you.” So when we Zapatistas say, “A world where many worlds fit,” they are saying, more or less, “Everyone do your own thing.” • 4) What is the point of “Part II” of this essay?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
