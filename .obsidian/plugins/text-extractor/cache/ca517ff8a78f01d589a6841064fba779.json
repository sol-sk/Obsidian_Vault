Assess P(Data|H0) • H0: Chance accounts for all change – a priori: P(-) = 0.5 – a posteriori: P(-) = 0.9 • What is probability of observing 0.9 if we assume H0? – Use binomial distribution (pp. 596), where: • N = 10 • P = 0.5 • # P events = 9 13 How rare are 9 out of 10 reductions? 14 .0098 How rare are exactly 9 out of 10 reductions?How rare are at least 9 out of 10 reductions? 15 .0098 .0010 Directional Hypothesis Test How rare are at least 9 out of 10 reductions or increases? 16 .0098 .0010 .0098 .0010 Non-Directional Hypothesis Test P(data|H0) • P(data|H0) depends on H0/H1 – Exactly 9 out of 10 reductions occur at .0098 • We would rarely (if ever) report this probability – At least 9 out of 10 reductions occur at .0108 • This probability evaluates one-tail of the distribution – At least 9 out of 10 reductions or increases occur at .0216 • This probability evaluates two-tails of the distribution 17 p-value • Our p-value for a two-tailed (or non- directional) hypothesis test is p = .0216 • Do we reject H0? Or fail to reject H0? • It depends… on how often we are willing to be wrong when rejecting H0 18 p-value Traditions • Almost always use a non-directional hypothesis • Accept being wrong 5% when rejecting H0 – Set α = .05 • Observed p2-tail = .0216, when α = .05 • Observed p is less than α, thus we reject H0 – “At post-test, patients were significantly less likely to report being fearful compared to pre-test, p = .0216.” 19","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
