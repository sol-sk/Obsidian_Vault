Other negative symptoms rarely improve with typical antipsychotics3Limitations of the Dopamine Hypothesis(I)•Several findings challenge the dopamine hypothesis 1) Antipsychotics block dopamine receptors right away, yet drug treatment takes ~2 weeks to reach full effect–If schizophrenia is merely an increase in dopamine, drugs should work right away–**More recent research suggests that the drugs mayreduce psychotic symptoms relatively quickly, but it takes ~ 2 weeks for treatments to reach full effect. 2) Not all with schizophrenia respond to drugs that block dopamine receptors–If schizophrenia is merely an increase in dopamine, drugs should work for all patients3) Dopamine blockers can alleviate psychosis, but not negative symptoms –If cognitive deficits are due to an increase in dopamine, these drugs should alleviate the symptoms4Limitations of the Dopamine Hypothesis(II)4) Some drugs that reduce symptoms do not block D2 receptors that well•Example: Clozapine (atypical antipsychotic)•Not as effective at blocking D2 receptors as classical antipsychotics–Less likely to produce motor side effects•Has a much higher affinity to other receptors, like serotonin (5 HT)•Can sometimes improve negative symptoms (possibly via 5 HT blockade)If positive and negative symptoms are merely due to overstimulation of D2 receptors, atypical antipsychotics shouldn’t work as well•Treatment issue: some patients have an adverse blood reaction to clozapine; not all patients can take it safely5Limitations of the Dopamine Hypothesis(III)•If schizophrenia is just an increase in dopamine, why should drugs that increases dopamine releaseimprovecognition?-Maybe dopamine is not increased in all brain regions in schizophrenia?
