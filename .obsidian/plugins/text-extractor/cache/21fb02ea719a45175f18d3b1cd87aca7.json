Warm-up Activity (testimonials) Assembly 4 Of Blood, Bodies and Flowers… Poniatowska: “The wound is still fresh, and Mexicans, though stunned by this blow, are beginning to ask themselves questions in open- mouthed amazement. The blood of hundreds of students, of men, women, children, soldiers, and oldsters tracked now all over Tlatelolco has dried now. It has sunk once again into the quiet earth. Later, flowers will bloom among the ruins and the tombs”(208) (237) One of today’s tasks: paying attention to images!

Discussion #4 • This week’s facilitators will post their “wrap-up” of their small group’s discussion of this topic in the discussion. • The rest of you will participate in the Canvas discussion by posing your thoughts (1 individual post to express your specific ideas and you should respond as well to 1-2 classmates’ ideas as well!). • To participate go to https://canvas.ubc.ca, Discussions - Discussion #4. You have until next Wednesday BEFORE class [11:59am] to participate! The earlier, the better! • On Monday: We will review/wrap-up Massacre in Mexico and begin discussing the film El Grito. Please keep in mind that the final 20-30 minutes of the film does get into some footage of the “Night of Tlatelolco” so there may be some scenes with physical violence.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
