Please take note: The new Coronavirus can incubate for 14-27 days, and can be asymptomatic while communicable; but once symptoms emerge, a lot of lungs show significant fibrosis. Taiwanese doctors recommend a very effective self- diagnosing technique: Take a deep breath and hold it for 10 seconds. If you can easily do it without coughing or feeling pressure in your chest, then congratulations, you haven’t caught the virus! Japanese doctors recommend a very effective prevention technique: We need to maintain moisture in our oral cavity and throat. Drinking water every 15 minutes can protect your oral cavity, and also flush the virus in your mouth down into your stomach, where it gets killed by your stomach acid. If we don’t drink enough water, the virus will enter the trachea and attack the lungs, becoming a huge threat to our lives!

Ways of Knowing Scientific method “Unscientific” (non-data-driven) methods Experience Folk wisdom/ common sense Authority IntuitionLogic 12 Intuition ▪ Unquestioning acceptance of own judgment Caption: “It would appear, Hopkins, that your gut feel was only indigestion” 13 Intuition ▪ Pros: ▫ More quickly and easily access knowledge ▫ Allows us to understand values that are important to us ▪ Cons: ▫ Difficult to analyse and critique ▫ Subject to prejudices and misconceptions 14 Authority ▪ Knowledge based on information from “credible other” 15 Authority ▪ Pros: ▫ Minimises need to acquire knowledge on our own ▫ Many people of authority have legitimate credentials to be considered “authority” ▪ Cons: ▫ Authorities may be wrong, or use intuition, experience, or folk wisdom ▫ “Authority” may be due to perceived cues of credibility (e.g. attractiveness, popularity) 16 Common Sense/Folk Wisdom ▪ Appealing to what one expects everyone else to know 17 Common Sense/Folk Wisdom ▪ Pros: ▫ There is an explanation for every situation ▫ A short, mutually understood way of communicating more complicated idea ▪ Cons: ▫ Often contradictory, rendering them meaningless ▫ Cannot be refuted or falsified 18 Experience ▪ Relying on personal experience to make decisions 19 Experience ▪ Pros: ▫ May be representative of collection of all possible experiences ▫ Vivid examples that are easy to remember ▪ Cons: ▫ May not be representative of collection of all possible experiences ▫ Cannot account for alternative explanations 20 How do we know what we know? Ways of Knowing Scientific method “Unscientific” (non-data-driven) methods Experience Folk wisdom/ common sense Authority IntuitionLogic 21 Logic ▪ Knowledge derived from rules of logical thinking Bubble: “Penguins are black and white. Some old TV shows are black and white. Therefore, some penguins are old TV shows.” Caption: “Logic: Another thing that penguins aren’t very good at.” 22 Logic ▪ Pros: ▫ Leads to internally consistent reasoning and decisions ▫ Easy to analyse and critique ▪ Cons: ▫ Logical reasoning may be based on incorrect premises or information, or other logical fallacies ▫ What may be logically consistent may actually differ from what occurs in the world 23 Activity ▪ Come up with one time that you or someone you know relied on ▫ Authority OR ▫ Intuition OR ▫ Folk wisdom/common sense OR ▫ Logic… ▪ …to make a decision or judgment – whether it went right or wrong! 24 Responses Games do cause violent behaviour: - Violent games desensitize people to violence - Gamers who play violent games may want to live out fantasies in real life Games do not cause violent behaviour: - Something else is probably at play, not a direct link (lots of people play violent games are not violent) - Some people may be predisposed to violent behaviour - Violence predates video games (see gladiators D:) 25 Critical Thinking & Science ▪ Research methods give us a common language and set of tools to guide and encourage critical thinking ▪ Not the only way of knowing… ▫ …but it’s the way by which all scientists abide (Indigenous ways of knowing and research, discussed later in term) ▪ Psychological science relies on the scientific method, and is data-driven 26 Getting to know a bit about you ▪ Go to http://bit.ly/217students to fill out: ▫ Name ▫ What do you hope to learn in this class? ▫ What question(s) and/or expectation(s) do you have about this class? ▫ Why did you choose psychology as your major?* ▫ What are you most excited about regarding PSYC 217? ▫ What are you most worried about regarding PSYC 217? ▫ What’s your favourite song (in any language)?*","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
