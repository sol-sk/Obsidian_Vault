S., Fishbach, A., Förster, J., & Werth, L. (2003). Attentional priming effects on creativity. Creativity Research Journal, 15, 277-286. doi: 10.1080/10400419.2003.9651420 17 Concepts illustrated ▪ Attempted replication of published study ▪ Study that can be completed in ~5 minutes ▪ Operational definition of IV ▪ Experimental control via the manipulation ▪ Operational definition of DV ▪ Importance of accuracy, consistency ▪ Random assignment to condition ▪ Importance of controlled environment 18 Practical Considerations ▪ How do we design the study to maximize the chances that we’ll be able to… ▫ Conclude that the IV caused changes in the DV? ▫ Detect an effect if it’s there? 19 Practical Considerations ▪ Experimental control ▫ Ensuring only the IV changes across conditions ▫ Avoiding alternative explanations, such as demand characteristics, experimenter expectancy effects ▪ Optimizing our operational definitions of the IV and the DV ▫ Avoiding ceiling and floor effects ▫ Appropriately pairing IV and DV 20 Demand Characteristics ▪ “Any feature of an experiment that might inform participants of the purpose of the study.” – Cozby, Mar, & Rawn ▫ Threat to internal validity ▪ Participants might try to help/hurt hypothesis ▫ Participant reactance ▫ Evaluation apprehension ▪ Example: 21 Options for Avoiding Demand Characteristics ▪ Options? Keep the participant blind to the hypothesis of the study Questions/items in a study that have little to do with the actual 22 Experimenter Expectancy Effects","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
