Introduction6 As a first step: How does communication occur within a single neuron? Introduction7 A healthy neuron has a resting membrane potential (or membrane voltage) of between -60 and -80 mV (the voltage inside the neuron is 60-80 mV less than outside the neuron). extracellular electrode intracellular electrode (must have a very fine tip) Resting membrane potential8 The membrane potential • Originally performed with invertebrates (why?) • Varies a little from cell to cell / region to region (why?) • https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=k48jXzFGMc8 Resting membrane potential9 Neuronal communication is chemical 1. Primarily the result of two ions, sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) 2. Ions move into or out of the cell, but not freely Resting membrane potential10 Neuronal communication is electrical 1. Ions are positively and negatively charged (Na+ and K+ are both positive, as per “+”) 2. As they move into or out of cell, they change the potential (voltage) at the membrane Note: absence of pos. is neg.! i.e. remove a pos., leave a neg. Resting membrane potential11 Chemical gradients • Ions want to flow from high concentration to low concentration Resting membrane potential12 Electrical gradients • Charge/potential wants to flow from high concentration to low concentration, too • Sometimes electrical and chemical gradients are at odds, causing an equilibrium that =/= 0mV Resting membrane potential13 The cell membrane - guardian • Lipid bilayer is tightly packed, both hydrophobic and hydrophilic, keeping out all dangerous entities • e.g.? Resting membrane potential14 Channels and pumps • Only certain molecules and ions permitted via channels and pumps • Channels: allow passive diffusion (i.e. along chemical gradient) • Pumps: actively push ions against their chemical gradient • Requires energy (ATP) channel pump Resting membrane potential15 A cell with no channels or pumps • Nothing moves into or out of the cell K+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ K+ K+ K+ K+ K+ K+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ K+ K+ K+ K+ K+ 0mV Resting membrane potential16 The Sodium-Potassium Pump • Embedded in cell membrane • Extremely important • Consumes 2/3rds of all neuronal energy! • Pushes 3 Na+ out and 2 K+ in • i.e. Active process that requires energy • How does this affect the chemical gradients? • How does this affect the electrical gradient? Resting membrane potential17 The Sodium-Potassium Pump Resting membrane potential18 Potassium “leak” channels • K+ can move freely via K+ “leak” channels that are always open • Na+ cannot move freely across the membrane • It has channels, but they are usually closed Resting membrane potential19 Cells are polarized • Na+/K+ pump pushing more Na+ out of cell than K+ into cell • Result: inside of cell slightly more negative than outside • But K+ can move freely through its leak channels • Result: K+ wants to move with chemical gradient, out of the cell • But this moving K+ is making the cell even more negative • Result: flow of K+ stops when force of electrical gradient equals force of chemical gradient • End result: cell has resting membrane potential of ~-70mV Resting membrane potential20 Cells are polarized K+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ K+ K+ K+ K+ K+ K+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ K+ K+ K+ K+ K+ -70mV Chemical force pushing K+ out of the cell equals Electrical force pushing K+ into the cell Na+/K+ pump (always working) K+ leak channel (always open) Na+ channel (closed) Resting membrane potential21 Cells are polarized Resting membrane potential22 When a neurotransmitter molecule binds to a postsynaptic receptor, it can have one of two localized effects: 1. Depolarize the membrane (e.g., decrease membrane potential from -70 to -67mV) 2. Hyperpolarize the membrane (e.g., increase the membrane potential from -70 to -72mV) Postsynaptic potentials23 When a neurotransmitter molecule binds to a postsynaptic receptor, it can have one of two localized effects: 1. Depolarize the membrane = Excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) 2. Hyperpolarize the membrane = Inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) Postsynaptic potentials24 When a neurotransmitter molecule binds to a postsynaptic receptor, it can have one of two localized effects: 1. Depolarize the membrane = EPSP = Increase likelihood that the postsynaptic neuron will fire an action potential (AP) 2. Hyperpolarize the membrane = IPSP = Decrease the likelihood that the postsynaptic neuron will fire an AP Postsynaptic potentials25 When a neurotransmitter molecule binds to a postsynaptic receptor, it can have one of two localized effects: 1. Depolarize the membrane = EPSP = Increase likelihood that the postsynaptic neuron will fire an action potential (AP) 2. Hyperpolarize the membrane = IPSP = Decrease the likelihood that the postsynaptic neuron will fire an AP The transmission of postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) is graded, rapid, and decremental: PSPs travel like an electrical signal along an uninsulated wire. Postsynaptic potentials26 EPSPs and IPSPs sum both spatially and temporally Postsynaptic potentials27 If the sum of the EPSPs and IPSPs that reaches the axon initial segment is sufficient to depolarize the membrane there above its threshold of excitation (e.g., -55mV) then an action potential (AP) is generated The AP is a massive momentary reversal of the membrane potential (e.g., from -70 to +55 mV) AP Generation The action potential28 Reverse the polarity! • Action potential: a rapid, brief reversal of the polarity at the membrane, from negative to positive • It’s the main method of brain communication • It’s all-or-none (off or on), not graded (e.g. 0-100%) • i.e. always the same size/shape in a cell • How do neurons convey magnitude, then? • Why does this reversal happen? The action potential29 Once the membrane potential reaches a certain threshold, an action potential (AP) can be generated The action potential30 AP generation and conduction are both the result of voltage-activated ion channels (primarily Nav) The action potential31 Small depolarizations • Remember: Na+ channels usually closed • But these Na+ channels are voltage-gated, i.e. they open at a certain voltage (~-55mV) The action potential Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ K+ K+K+ K+ K+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ K+ K+ K+K+ K+ -70mV Na+ K+ Na+/K+ pump (always working) K+ channel (always open) Na+ channel (closed) 32 Small depolarizations • When enough EPSPs arrive at the same time (~5-10mV), the membrane is depolarized enough to reach the Na+ channels’ voltage threshold (threshold potential), and the channels open! • Which direction does Na+ want to flow? Why? The action potential Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ K+ K+K+ K+ K+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ K+ K+ K+K+ K+ -70mV Na+ K+ Na+/K+ pump (always working) K+ channel (always open) Na+ channel (closed) 33 Rapid huge depolarization • Na+ channels open à Na+ into cell • Effect? • Cell membrane flips from neg. to pos. • BUT Na+ channels have built-in inactivation • Shut-off automatically, after ~1ms • Na+ channels stay inactivated until membrane goes back to resting potential • i.e. No more action potentials until reset! • This leads to the absolute refractory period The action potential34 Repolarization • K+ channels, as always, are open • But even more K+ channels open during AP (some others are voltage-gated) • Membrane is now pos., so which way does K+ flow? • Effect: return cell to neg. resting membrane potential • Slow closing of voltage-gated K+ channels leads to hyperpolarization phase and the relative refractory period • Na+/K+ pump restores ion balance over time (slow) The action potential35 The action potential36 Effect of subthreshold stimulation of an axon: An excitatory potential is produced, but it is not sufficient to elicit an AP Conduction37 Effect of suprathreshold stimulation of an axon: An excitatory potential is produced that exceeds the threshold of excitation and produces an AP that continues undiminished down the axon Conduction38 Conduction in an Unmyelinated Axon Conduction • Na+ channels are present all along the axon • Unmyelinated axons: Na+ channels everywhere 39 Axon Myelination Conduction40 Conduction in a Myelinated Axon Conduction • Na+ channels are present all along the axon • Unmyelinated axons: Na+ channels everywhere • Myelinated axons: Na+ channels only at the Nodes of Ranvier 41 Speed and direction • Action potential is faster down myelinated axon than unmyelinated axon • Why? (Two reasons) • Action potential only travels in one direction • Thanks to Na+ channel – why? Conduction42 End of the line • Axon ends in terminal boutons (“buttons”) • Bouton has vesicles (“bubbles”?) filled with neurotransmitters • Action potential depolarizes bouton à Causes voltage-gated Ca++ channels to open à Ca++ causes vesicles to fuse with membrane à Neurotransmitters released into synapse Neurotransmission 43 Welcome to the synapse • Dendrite membrane has special receptors that fit, like lock and key, with the neurotransmitters • Receptors are often just (closed) channels that open when they bind with neurotransmitter! • i.e. ligand-gated ion channels Glu: glutamate, most common excitatory neurotransmitter Neurotransmission 44 Types of Potentials PSPs APs Graded Yes No Strength AM FM Rapid Yes Less so Decremental Yes No 45 A virtual neuron 1. Go to: https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/neuron and run the simulation 2. Identify three proteins that we discussed 3. Identify one protein we did not discuss—it is real, but not particularly physiologically relevant for our story of RMPs and APs 4. Describe what’s happening at rest (i.e. during resting membrane potential), as regards ionic flow (it helps to zoom in) 5. Describe the order of events when you stimulate the neuron (it helps to slow it down) 6. Turn on the potential chart (bottom right corner). What do you see when you stimulate the neuron? Be specific about voltage changes. 7. Turn on the “Show Concentrations” option (bottom right corner). What do the concentrations tell you at rest? How do those concentrations change when you stimulate the neuron? What do those changes tell you about the effects of an action potential?
