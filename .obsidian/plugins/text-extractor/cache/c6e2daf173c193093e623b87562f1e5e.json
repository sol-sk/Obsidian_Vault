Ariel Ariel is a turn-of-the-century text in which José Enrique Rodó outlines his philosophy on why America should return to the classics and (Greece, Rome, Europe (France, in particular), and turn away from a hasty “pioneer” way (US) of establishing a new ideological and cultural identity for Latin America. In the work, “youth” is the mindset of the future. What does youth mean to Rodó? Enthusiasm, intellect, a capacity to forge ahead (without forgetting the past, but also while thinking of a bright new future), and not conforming to the masses… For Friday! • Read pp. 31-40 in Ariel. (Available in PDF on Canvas!) • In class, we will hold our first mock-Assembly, and combine a brief (very brief !) recap of Shakespeare’s The Tempest and some opening analyses of Rodó’s Ariel.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
